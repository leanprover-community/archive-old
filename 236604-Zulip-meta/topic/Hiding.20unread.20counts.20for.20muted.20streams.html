<p>This may just be my own OCD, but in case anyone else is similarly mildlyirked -- I wanted to hide the unread count for streams I'm subscribed to but have muted -- I don't see a zulip option to do that, but it looks like killing elements with a CSS selector like <code>##li.out_of_home_view .unread_count</code> will do it. Put that into uBlock Origin's element picker.</p>
