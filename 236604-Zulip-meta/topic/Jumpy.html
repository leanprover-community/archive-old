<p>I don't suppose anyone else experiences the zulip UI being jumpy when first loaded? And has a fix for it? I.e. I load the page, start reading something, and 10 seconds in the UI updates itself and takes me somewhere jarringly different. It's quite minor but still has managed to irk me.</p>

<p>Yes, I've seen this. A couple of weeks ago it was much worse, the jump happening randomly. They fixed that issue but it seems it came back in a different way.</p>
