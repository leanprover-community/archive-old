<p>I propose that we allow more people permission to edit topics and change the streams of topics. It seems we fairly often want to do this, and it is sufficiently harmless that there is little risk.</p>

<p>One solution would be to allow <em>everyone</em> to do this.</p>

<p>Another is that there is a class of user called "moderator", which currently we don't seem to make use of. I could allow moderators this permission, then bump up a big cohort of people to that.</p>

<p>I agree that moving topics between streams does not need to be behind the moderator flag, but I would not want arbitrary users to have access to all the other things that moderators can do</p>

<p>I've changed the settings so that "Who can edit the topic of any message" and "Who can move messages between streams" is available to admins and moderators instead of just admins. We should probably make more people zulip moderators, at the very least the actual maintainers</p>

<p>The main effect of this, following Mario's change, is that now all <span class="user-group-mention" data-user-group-id="2494">@maintainers</span> can edit topic titles, and change the streams of topics.</p>

<p>I don't think there's any particular reason that mathlib maintainers and zulip moderators need to coincide exactly, so if anyone wants to (self-)nominate zulip moderator status for someone, just say so.</p>
