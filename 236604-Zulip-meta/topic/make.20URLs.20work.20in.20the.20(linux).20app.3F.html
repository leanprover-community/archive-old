<p>Sometimes people post URLs on e.g. Discord linking to discussions in the Lean Zulip. When I click on them it opens a browser window, and if the link is to a message which is not in a public stream then the URL might not even work. I know I can just log into Zulip through my web browser but I was wondering if there was a cool way to e.g. take the URL <a href="#narrow/stream/144837-PR-reviews/topic/lean.23692">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR-reviews/topic/lean.23692</a> and leap directly to whatever this is pointing to in Zulip (actually it just occurred to me that if I post this message then I can probably just click on the link :D)</p>

<p>Aah cool so one workaround is that I DM the URL to myself on the app. That's nice because it will work on mobile as well, and is probably no less hassle than any answer I was expecting of the form "paste it into the search bar and delete some stuff" or whatever</p>
