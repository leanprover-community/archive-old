<p>Now that I have had some time to actively use this site, one feature here that I can't seem to find are tags for topics/replies.</p>
<p>I have read Zulip issue - <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/1901">Enable tagging of messages and listing all the tags #1901</a> and find that others also seek tags but yet there is no Zulip core mechanism for tags, only work arounds that are not a true fit.</p>
<p>The reason I ask is that I am now regularly searching for answers to my questions before posting but having to search for just words often results in hundreds if not more items in the result list. At which point I just post a new topic. If there were tags I feel that I would probably find more useful info faster and not be asking as many questions.</p>

<p>So far we've dealt with the "problem" by just reposting and reanswering questions. If someone remembers an older thread, they post a link to it.</p>

<p>You can always send links to interesting threads to yourself in a message, where you can then write some context</p>

<p>For what it's worth, there's also the star button next to the emoji button if you hover over a message, which functions like a bookmark.</p>
