<p>(Woohoo -- my recent attempts to get my github notifications sorted so that they're meaningful and hence worth reading is paying off.)</p>
<p>Zulip is <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/14420#issuecomment-849236591">thinking about LaTeX macros</a> and asking for user input on how this might look. I personally could imagine some site-wide macro file where <code>\Q:=\mathbb{Q}</code> and <code>\C:=\mathbb{C}</code> are defined (those are the two I miss the most) however I once wrote a joint paper where my co-author inserted <a href="https://gist.github.com/kbuzzard/b91827a4d8518cdbc9fa79bba24ceb3f">the following 861 lines</a> at the beginning of our LaTeX file (these lines are at the top of every paper they write, apparently). I have some memory that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> thinks this is a terrible design decision though. Do we as a community have any thoughts that we want to feed back to Zulip?</p>

<p>It would be cool if zulip let these be set as user preferences and expanded the macros when the message is sent</p>

<p>Ah, I see a per-user file was one of the suggestions</p>

<p>I think the following would be most flexible: A default set of macros set by the community, but this default can be overridden by  each user individually.<br>
Though just a community file (without personal customization) should also be fine.</p>
