<p>I wonder if it is reaching the point we should have multiple <code>lean4</code> streams. My thinking is basically we should have "stuff Leo might want to see" and "stuff he won't". Zulip maintainers can then try to shuffle things into the right places at first.</p>

<p>I don't think it's worth it at this time. The issue seems to be a mismatch of expectation regarding the level of formality on zulip in general, and I don't think we should make a split along formality lines because an #off-topic stream is sure to draw more off-topic things than we already get. I don't think we need to change anything regarding the level of jokes / code of conduct stuff either.</p>

<p>I was thinking more in terms of splitting into <code>lean4-getting-started</code>, <code>lean4-general</code>, and <code>lean4-issues</code>.</p>

<p>Oh that might be worth a try</p>
