<p>I sometimes wonder which zulip stream I should go to when I get stuck on a project and need assistance. <a class="stream" data-stream-id="113489" href="/#narrow/stream/113489-new-members">#new members</a> doesn't feel quite right, since it's described more as a place for new people to introduce themselves, and I've been around a few months. <a class="stream" data-stream-id="113488" href="/#narrow/stream/113488-general">#general</a> feels too nonspecific. Should we consider adding a "help" stream for this kind of thing?</p>

<p>Up to now, we've been using <a class="stream" data-stream-id="113489" href="/#narrow/stream/113489-new-members">#new members</a> for "newbie" questions (the description of the stream does currently include "onboarding") and <a class="stream" data-stream-id="113488" href="/#narrow/stream/113488-general">#general</a> for more advanced questions that don't fit in <a class="stream" data-stream-id="116395" href="/#narrow/stream/116395-maths">#maths</a> or <a class="stream" data-stream-id="217875" href="/#narrow/stream/217875-Is-there-code-for-X.3F">#Is there code for X?</a>. Admittedly, the division between these streams is not very sharp, but I don't think it has to be either.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="282271">@Bolton Bailey</span> When in doubt, just use <code>general</code> or <code>new members</code>.</p>
