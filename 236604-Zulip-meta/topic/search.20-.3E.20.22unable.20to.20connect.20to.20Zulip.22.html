<p>Has anyone else experienced this recently? When I use the (ubuntu) Zulip app search facility, I often get an "unable to connect to Zulip" error, even though my internet connection is stable and fine, and Zulip works fine when not searching. I'm wondering whether this particular site has got so big that searching is taking too long and something is timing out.</p>

<p>yeah, I think I've also noticed that. By since I'm in Germany, I always thought it was my internet connection that was flaky.</p>

<p>zulip's been pretty slow for me in general lately</p>

<p><a href="http://chat.zulip.org">chat.zulip.org</a> has more messages than we do and way more users, so that's probably not the cause, unless they give themselves better hosting than we get (which is a possibility)</p>

<p>Although interestingly, we have similar numbers of 15-day active users!</p>

<p>Thanks for the reports! We are seeing some slowness in searches in large Zulip Cloud orgs, and will look into how to fix it. We likely will not be able to address this before the holidays, but do post here if it's really causing you trouble.</p>
<p>For anyone who is curious, <a href="http://chat.zulip.org">chat.zulip.org</a> is a totally separate installation from Zulip Cloud, so you may see different performance there even if other parameters are similar.</p>
