<p>Hi folks! We're getting close to rolling out a beta version of web public streams, i.e. a Zulip-native alternative to zulip-archive. We have documented this upcoming feature <a href="https://chat.zulip.org/help/web-public-streams">here</a>, and would love to get some feedback.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is anything on the help page unclear/confusing?</li>
<li>Do you have any questions about this feature that the help page fails to answer?</li>
<li>Do you have any concerns about the way the feature is designed to work?</li>
<li>Is there any key functionality that's missing?</li>
</ol>
<p>Please feel free to respond here or on the <a href="https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/2-general/topic/web.20public.20streams">Zulip development community discussion thread</a>. Thanks!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="439115">@Alya Abbott</span> This is great news, we've been wanting this for a while. A question / feature request: If you are not logged in and follow a zulip-internal link to a web public stream like </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#narrow/stream/236604-Zulip-meta/topic/web.20public.20streams">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/236604-Zulip-meta/topic/web.20public.20streams</a> or </li>

</ul>
<p>It should redirect to the corresponding "archive" link. We have lots of these kinds of links in commit messages and blog posts where changing them is not feasible, but we would still like them to be resolved to the web public version for external users.</p>

<p>Hi folks! I'm excited to announce that we should be ready to open up the web-public streams feature for beta-testing here in the next week or so. :)</p>
<p>Our plan is to give early access to a few organizations like this one so that we can iron out any glitches before releasing the feature to everyone on Zulip Cloud. If you happen to be part of another Zulip Cloud organization that would be interested in testing out web-public streams and providing feedback, please PM me to arrange it.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can already check out the feature in the Zulip development community by clicking on "Access without an account (Beta)" on the <a href="https://chat.zulip.org/login/">chat.zulip.org login page</a>.</p>

<p>Also, at this point we have clarified that web-public streams will <em>not</em> be indexable by search engines. It would be a significant project to make them indexable (or add that as an option), so that will probably happen at some point, but definitely not right away.</p>

<p>Hi folks! The web-public streams feature is now available in this organization! Streams can be set to web-public visibility once an administrator <a href="https://zulip.com/help/web-public-streams#enable-or-disable-web-public-streams">enables web-public streams</a>. You should also check to make sure you're happy with the set of <a href="https://zulip.com/help/web-public-streams#manage-who-can-create-web-public-streams">roles that can create web-public streams</a>.</p>
<p>In order to find and fix any remaining issues, we have so far enabled this feature for a very small number of organizations. Please share feedback about any problems you see, big or small!</p>

<p>Hi folks! Any feedback on web-public streams so far?</p>
<p>We're working on a blog post for announcing that the feature is out of beta (sometime in May). So in addition to reporting issues/feature requests, positive quotes about web-public streams that could be shared are helpful too. :)</p>
<p>Please feel free to PM me if that's better for chatting about putting together a shareable quote.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="439115">@Alya Abbott</span> as far as I can tell, the web-public streams are working as expected, which is great! It's definitely a big step up. And I'm grateful for all the work that went into it and don't mean to minimize the contribution. But I have to say I was a little disappointed by</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, at this point we have clarified that web-public streams will not be indexable by search engines. It would be a significant project to make them indexable (or add that as an option), so that will probably happen at some point, but definitely not right away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IMO getting the chat publicly indexed was a huge reason why we (I?) was looking forward to web-public streams. Public Gitter chats seem to be indexed, I still occasionally turn up the old Lean Gitter when I'm looking for things on Google. There's a <em>ton</em> of knowledge stored in this Zulip that's still hard to access even with the web-public streams.</p>
<p>Do you know what the challenges are that make this a significant project? Is there a discussion about it somewhere I could read? It's definitely out of my world and I don't think I could help with it myself but I'm curious.</p>
