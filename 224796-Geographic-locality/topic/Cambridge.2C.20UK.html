<p>Today will probably be the last in person one for Michaelmas, so I think the plan would be to move online (probably on the Xena server) until Lent term. On the other hand, I (and maybe a few others) will be around in Cambridge over the Christmas vacation.</p>

<p>Dear Cambridge Lean users, there is a suggestion to start an informal  common seminar series  on formalisation of mathematics between the Mathematics Dpt and the Computer Science Dpt, mainly for students.  Would you be interested in participating, attending and giving talks? Most of us at the  Computer Science Dpt where I'm based work with Isabelle, but the seminar will be open to all proof assistants.</p>

<p>Hi everyone, the Cambridge joint seminar is starting this Thursday!  <span aria-label="tada" class="emoji emoji-1f389" role="img" title="tada">:tada:</span></p>
<p>"Formalisation of mathematics with interactive theorem provers"<br>
(Thursdays at 17:00-18:00, starting this Thursday Jan. 19th.) hosted at the Centre for Mathematical Sciences. (Most meetings will be in person only, but whenever the speaker is remote, it will be possible to participate virtually too).<br>
This is a joint seminar series between the Department of Computer Science and Technology and the Faculty of Mathematics, on the fast-growing area of formalisation of mathematics with proof assistants (interactive theorem provers) such as Isabelle and Lean. All levels welcome. Undergraduate students are particularly encouraged to actively participate.<br>
Our first speaker opening the series is Professor Lawrence C. Paulson: "Formalised Mathematics: Obstacles and Achievements".<br>
You can find the schedule and relevant information at the link below :<br>
<a href="http://www.talks.cam.ac.uk/show/index/164015">http://www.talks.cam.ac.uk/show/index/164015</a><br>

Hope to see many of you!</p>
