<p>Studying for a <a href="http://B.sc" title="http://B.sc">B.sc</a> in maths at the University of Gothenburg. Trying to learn Lean in my spare time, hopefully I'll be good enough to contribute to mathlib in time.</p>

<p>Hej! If you're interested in type theory more broadly, check out the <a href="https://github.com/InitialTypes/Club" title="https://github.com/InitialTypes/Club">Initial Types Club</a> at Chalmers. It's a weekly-ish undergrad-friendly seminar on type theory and adjacent topics (or at least it was when I was there).</p>

<p>Thanks for the link. Unfortunately I'm more interested in the mathematical side of Lean rather than the type-theoretic, but I might check it out in the future if my tastes have changed :)</p>

<p>I'll allow it. But be aware that this is all an elaborate scheme for generating type theory PhDs. <span aria-label="octopus" class="emoji emoji-1f419" role="img" title="octopus">:octopus:</span></p>

<p>It's supposed to be an elaborate scheme for getting mathematicians interested in theorem provers!</p>
