<p>I've relocated to Edinburgh (at UoE) and see there's no Stream, so I'm starting one here. Who knows, maybe some of the Agda people decide to wander over to the Lean 'dark side' <span aria-label="wink" class="emoji emoji-1f609" role="img" title="wink">:wink:</span></p>

<p>You could start by taking a look at the algebraic_geometry directory in mathlib, and there might even be a github project running for the chapter 2 stuff. The chapter 3 stuff is happening in LTE mostly.</p>

<p>Hi Edinburgh Lean people!</p>
<p>David Jordan and I are based in the School of Maths and planning to run a pilot course this semester on Lean aimed at graduate students in algebra, topology, geometry, category theory etc. This is part of the group's aim of delivering some form of programming relevant to grad students in algebra and related fields. We though Lean might be more interesting than just going over a computer algebra system, and it might be more of a level starting point since Lean could be quite different to the sorts of languages the students are most likely to have met before.</p>
<p>David and I are just starting out learning Lean ourselves, so the course will be very student led and collaborative. A reasonable goal for the course would be that participants learn how to interact with the Lean environment, and to access the existing library of mathematics, and that by the end we are able to venture into proving new theorems (i.e. translating known theorems from our discipline) into the library. So we will probably start with some tutorials and then move more towards some project-based work.</p>
<p>We are still at the stage of planning how exactly the course will run. I wanted to touch base here since I'm aware, via Jon Eugster, that there are quite a few Lean experts mainly based in Informatics. Let me know if you have any thoughts, suggestions for teaching, project ideas, or any other interest in this pilot course.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Patrick</p>

<p>Hi, Patrick. Last semester, I taught an undergraduate class on formalizing mathematics at Carnegie Mellon. We spent the first half of the course making a quick run through the core parts of <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/">Mathematics in Lean</a>, after which students worked mainly on projects of their choosing. I'd be happy to answer questions.</p>

<p>Yes, let's restart them this semester! What about Thursday next week at 12 in MF1? Does that work for you <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="574412">@Patrick Kinnear</span>  and David Jordan?</p>

<p>Hi, Patrick. Last semester, I taught an undergraduate class on formalizing mathematics at Carnegie Mellon. We spent the first half of the course making a quick run through the core parts of <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/">Mathematics in Lean</a>, after which students worked mainly on projects of their choosing. I'd be happy to answer questions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks Jeremy! I take it you are based at Carnegie Mellon and not here in Edinburgh (i.e. there's no chance we'll see you in person)? I'd love to ask you some more questions about your course, though first I think David and I need to have a chat about exactly what we want to get out of ours. I'll keep in touch!</p>

<p>Thanks guys, yes I'd love to join  you for lunch next Thursday at 12 in the Inf. forum. I'll run it by David too and hopefully he's free.</p>
