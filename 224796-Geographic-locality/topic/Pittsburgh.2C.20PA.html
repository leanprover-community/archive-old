<p>Pittsburgh represent!<br>
The Pittsburgh area has a very active Lean community, centered around Carnegie Mellon University and the neighboring University of Pittsburgh. </p>
<p>We have weekly Lean meetings every Tuesday at 4.30pm in Thackeray Hall at Pitt.  (At least we used to, until the university closed down.)</p>

<p>We use the <code>cmu-lean</code> mailing list on Google groups for the weekly meeting announcements. It is a private mailing list  but anyone is welcome to join. You should be able to find it on Google groups and click a button to send a request, but in any case you can email me at <code>avigad@cmu.edu</code> and I will send an invite. </p>
<p>The meetings are informal. Sometimes we just talk shop, but I generally try to line up a volunteer to present something they are working on or a paper they are reading, or lead a discussion. The topics are not restricted to Lean; participants are generally interested in all aspects of formal methods and their applications to mathematics.</p>
<p>We have had a few meetings by Zoom since the lockdown began. We'll take a break this week, but we're still planning to meet sporadically, as people volunteer to present. I have nearly all the slides done for a talk I was going to give at a phil math conference last week (<a href="https://princetonphilmath.wordpress.com/" title="https://princetonphilmath.wordpress.com/">https://princetonphilmath.wordpress.com/</a>), so I'll present those a week from Tuesday (April 21) unless we get a better offer.</p>

<p>I am in Bethel Park.  Once this whole pandemic thing has resolved itself, I hope to become more involved with the Lean community at CMU and Pitt.  My background is in financial engineering, and as a result my mathematics background is more on the applied side.</p>
