<p>The Xena Project meets every Thursday evening during Imperial's term (early Oct to mid-Dec, early Jan to mid-March, mid-April to end of June) in the maths department at Imperial College London in South Kensington (although if you're not attached to Imperial there will be a few card-only locked doors you'll have to negotiate; ping me).</p>

<p>Hi,<br>
I'm based in London too (sort of, at least for work). Also studying (part-time) Mathematics at Birkbeck.<br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> is the Xena meetup still going on?</p>
