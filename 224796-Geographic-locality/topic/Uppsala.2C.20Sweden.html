<p>I'm a lecturer working in representation theory (of finite dimensional algebras and quivers) at Uppsala University, Sweden. Now trying to learn some basic things about proof verification. I currently find the tutorial "Mathematics in Lean" to be quite useful as an entry point (in the middle of the second chapter).</p>
