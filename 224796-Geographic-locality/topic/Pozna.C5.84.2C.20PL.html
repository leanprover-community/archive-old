<p>Hi, I am a Physics PhD graduate living in Poznań, Poland. I have just found out about the existence of Lean and other theorem provers yesterday and I am really excited about the topic.  I have a strong background in programming (currently working in ML for a medical applications) but I miss more scientific, "low-level" work and I love mathematics.  I love to tackle problems at a deep basic level. I taught calculus on various levels during my PhD and enjoyed it a lot. </p>
<p>It seems that there are not many people from my country here but maybe someday... It would be really amazing to create an on-site-meeting group. For now, luckily there is Internet.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="491746">@Miriam Kosik</span> , welcome! I have seen you enrolled in our Lean in Lyon workshop in a month time, or so, and I hope you will find it interesting. In the meantime, you will find a lot of nice and helpful people around. Have you tried playing with the <a href="https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/">NNG</a>?</p>

<p>Thanks, I am looking forward to it. I have already found lots of interesting material here and on the leanprover community. I am amazed how much has been done already. I installed Lean 4 yesterday and I am currently working through "Theorem Proving in Lean 4" but I will surely try to play the game as well.</p>

<p>FYI: Although Lean 4 has been out for a while and one can surely start using it, it might be relevant to know that <code>mathlib</code>, the huge math library you are probably referring to, is still written in Lean 3. There is a definitive plan to port everything to Lean 4, but for the time being most of the community is still working on Lean 3.</p>
