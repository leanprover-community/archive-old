<p>Hello! I'm a Maths &amp; Computer Science undergrad at the University of St Andrews &amp; I will be writing my final year project in Lean. I'd love to get chatting with some of you to share ideas as I'm quite new to lean!</p>

<p>Who's supervising you and do you have an idea of topic?</p>

<p>Dr. Louis Theran, and no not as of yet, still in early talks about a topic. I would love to contribute to mathlib though, so the Containers theorem about hypergraphs is one Idea we've had so far.</p>

<p>Welcome! Please give my regards to Louis. Just based on skimming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_method">the wikipedia page on the container method</a> I suspect <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="387244">@Yaël Dillies</span> would be able to give you some helpful pointers.</p>

<p>Although hypergraph containers are cool, I think it makes sense to go for graph containers (as in, say, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0940">https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0940</a>) first</p>

<p>It relies on less prerequisites for formalization, the proof is shorter, it has many applications and tends to be more efficient when applicable (that is, it is not completely subsumed by hypergraph containers)</p>

<p>Sorry, I'm afraid I don't know anything about containers!</p>

<p>I happen to be working on a Lean-based project with him, but it's not really related to Mathlib, it's more of a CS topic (about properties of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_model">memory consistency models</a>). Happy to chat about that too if the topic is very open and you're interested :) <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="545295">@Will Midwood</span></p>
