<p>This is not Lean or theorem proving directly but I would classify it as related. </p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs/list/21212">job ad</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The University of South Carolina invites applications for a SmartState Chair to direct the SmartState Center for Data Analysis, Simulation, Imaging, and Visualization (DASIV) in conjunction with the Williams-Hedberg-Hedberg Endowed Chair of Mathematics. This is a tenured, 9-month, full Professor position in the Department of Mathematics with the earliest starting date on August 16, 2023. The Center is co-sponsored by $2 million from the South Carolina SmartState Program established by the South Carolina General Assembly in 2002 (<a href="http://smartstatesc.org/">http://smartstatesc.org/</a>) and by $2 million from the University of South Carolina for a total endowment of $4 million. The primary appointment of the Chair will be within the Department of Mathematics, College of Arts and Sciences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I expect the position to come with very strong compensation and the ability to hire (subject to university approval) multiple persons at the tenure-track level. </p>
<p>If you have any questions or any suggestions, please let me know. For more general info, see the <a href="https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs/list/21212">ad on Mathjobs</a>.</p>
