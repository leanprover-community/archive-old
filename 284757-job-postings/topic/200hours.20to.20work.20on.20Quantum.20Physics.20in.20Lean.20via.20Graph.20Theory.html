<p>Hello!<br>
I am supporting the formalization of certain Graph Theory statements, which are closely related to work in quantum physics.</p>
<p>Concretely I am funding 200hours (a 25$) to work on this topic. It might be specifically interesting for undergraduates with experience in Lean, but everybody is invited to apply.</p>
<p>Please find the details here:<br>

<p>I would be excited to have some concrete math of quantum optics formalized in Lean!</p>
<p>Looking forward to your messages,<br>
Mario</p>
