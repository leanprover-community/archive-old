<p>We are hiring for several faculty position at the University of Cambridge. One of our target areas is logical foundations and formal methods. This is intended to be construed very broadly, to cover almost everyone working in  <strong>proof assistants</strong>, programming languages, logic, semantics, and verification -- if you think your research area might be in scope, it almost certainly is!</p>
<p>The deadline for applications is December 5, and the link to our advertisement is:</p>

<p>The Department of Computer Science and Technology is seeking to recruit a new faculty member at the Assistant or Associate Professor level who can contribute to research and teaching in the area of Logical Foundations and Formal Methods.</p>
<p>The Computer Science department in Cambridge has a long history of research in logical foundations and formal methods, from groundbreaking work on higher-order logic and the proof assistant Isabelle, through to a wide range of important semantic frameworks, such as bigraphs, event structures, and nominal sets. Today logical foundations and formal methods is a thriving area of activity, which is explored with a wide variety of mathematical and logical tools, including category theory, domain theory, finite model theory, linear logic, operational semantics, proof assistants, and type theory.</p>
<p>We seek to appoint a new member of faculty to complement and enhance our research in this area. The position is open to researchers working in the area of formal methods and logical foundations of computer science, broadly conceived. While no list of topics could be exhaustive, potential candidates might work in the areas of automata theory, automated deduction, categorical syntax and semantics, descriptive complexity, homotopy type theory, modal or temporal logic, rewriting, or type theory, as could researchers applying formal or logical tools in concurrency theory, databases, networks, programming languages, quantum computing and other emerging models of computation, or verification.</p>
<p>The ideal candidate for this position will have a strong international track record of publication and impact commensurate with their research area and experience. They will have the ability, or potential, to secure research funding to support their research vision and build a world-class team of researchers. We welcome applications from researchers with interdisciplinary interests who will collaborate with people across different subdisciplines in Computer Science and Technology and with other academic disciplines. Collaborations outside academia are also highly-valued, including with industry and third-sector organizations.</p>
<p>The University actively supports equality, diversity and inclusion and encourages applications from all sections of society.</p>
