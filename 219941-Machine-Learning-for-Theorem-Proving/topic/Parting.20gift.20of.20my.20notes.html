<p>Hi all,  due to a new great opportunity, I won't be able to post here as much as I have in the recent past or share my thoughts maybe as feely as I have been.  However, as a parting gift, I'd dumped (and I really mean "dump") a number of random thoughts on AI for TP into a GitHub repo (<a href="https://github.com/jasonrute/thoughts-on-ai-for-theorem-proving/">https://github.com/jasonrute/thoughts-on-ai-for-theorem-proving/</a>).  They are extremely rough, and mostly meandering.  However, I think the section on <a href="https://github.com/jasonrute/thoughts-on-ai-for-theorem-proving/blob/main/search.md">search</a> has some nice ideas which I wanted to share.  This is a really great community, and I'm glad I could be so active here for the past 2 years.</p>
