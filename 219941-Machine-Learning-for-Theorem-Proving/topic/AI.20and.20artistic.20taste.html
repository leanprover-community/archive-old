<p>One claim that is often made when it comes to AIs that will conjecture and prove their own theorems is that the mathematical spaces is infinite-dimensional and the AI will just wander off into some silly boring corner while it happily proves silly boring theorems.</p>
<p>I don't know much about AI. But have people trained AIs to judge music, or other forms of art? And score it along axes like</p>
<ul>
<li>this will be popular among the public (likes on youtube etc)</li>
<li>this will be considered "original"</li>
<li>this is technically difficult, but executed perfectly</li>
<li>etc...</li>

<p>I think partly the reason why humans don't wander off into silly boring corners is that we are essentially monkeys and so we have monkey intuition about several objects (including natural numbers and the 3-dimensional Euclidean space).</p>
<p>The vast majority of college students worldwide who take calculus probably don't know ZFC or any other formal system in which reals can be defined yet they manage to take derivatives. They just visually imagine a straight line and that's usually good enough.</p>
<p>Giving AI monkey intuition might be a way to prevent it from going to a silly boring corner. But developing monkey intuition took us millions of years so I am not sure how easy would it be.</p>

<p>On the other hand in the early 1980s when I was an active chess player it was sometimes argued that these crappy chess computers which played at sub-club level would never amount to anything, because humans played chess with a refined intuition which a machine would never emulate.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> we have techniques for that; called GANs (generative adversarial networks). They're not shining as much on text as they do on image; but they have already been applied successfully there. The training objective is exactly what you're describing. One model conjectures statements; the other judge them and attempt to discriminate between synthetic and "ground-truth" statements (say the ones in mathlib). The equilibrium is reached when the judge can't discriminate the fake statements anymore.</p>
<p>There are many variations around that idea that could be explored and are hugely exciting. But it all starts with having a good "prover" so that once we have generated these potentially interesting statements (or dare I say, definitions) we can submit them to a system that is not trivially bad at demonstrating/working with them (cc <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="116045">@Jesse Michael Han</span> who I know is prolly excited by these kind of projects). From there we can hope for continuous self-improvement and therefore potentially interesting knowledge creation.</p>
<p>We're right now focusing on the prover; because without a good prover there's not much useful we can do with these generations (without intensive human labour, which is just simply not available on planet earth for this kind of tasks at the scale we would need :p)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110043">@Gabriel Ebner</span>  So that's the main benefits of GANs, you don't need negative samples to start with. This setup, when it works, converges towards the distribution you want to mimic: here the distribution of mathlib statements. The negative examples are generated by the network that attempts to fake them; at the beginning they are quite bad and the discriminator can discriminate them. And is trained along with the generator on exactly that (discrimination of the mathlib statements vs the statements generated by generator).</p>

<p>Sounds good! I'm interested in seeing the paper</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One claim that is often made when it comes to AIs that will conjecture and prove their own theorems is that the mathematical spaces is infinite-dimensional and the AI will just wander off into some silly boring corner while it happily proves silly boring theorems.</p>
<p>I don't know much about AI. But have people trained AIs to judge music, or other forms of art? And score it along axes like</p>
<ul>
<li>this will be popular among the public (likes on youtube etc)</li>
<li>this will be considered "original"</li>
<li>this is technically difficult, but executed perfectly</li>
<li>etc...</li>
</ul>

<p>I think this is generally an important issue, but maybe an AI will wander into a corner that we currently consider silly and boring, but is actually beautiful beyond human comprehension? One somewhat naïve way to go about this is that because I (and probably a lot of other mathematicians) intuitively consider long proofs that do not introduce novel concepts to be silly and boring, so if we could penalize longness and somehow recognize lack-of-novelty to penalize that as well, I think that would be a significant improvement over the purely stupid approach of training just a theorem prover.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also there's been work on training AIs to learn human preferences. For example, <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-2-preference-learning">gwern trained GPT-2 to learn how to make good music</a>. Also there's <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=human+preference+learning+artificial+intelligence">this Google Scholar search I just did</a> which turns up a lot of more results that are kind-of-like-this. (I'm pretty sure there's more work/research in this area but I'm too lazy to find out.)</p>
