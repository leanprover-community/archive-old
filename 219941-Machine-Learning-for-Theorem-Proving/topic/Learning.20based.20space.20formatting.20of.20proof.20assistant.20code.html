<p>Dear Lean ML community,</p>
<p>My collaborators and I recently presented our work-in-progress on learning-based space formatting of Coq files at the Coq Workshop (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16743">abstract on arXiv</a> and <a href="https://coq-workshop.gitlab.io/2020/slides/Coq2020_02-03-formatting-slides.pdf">slides</a>). We used a dataset that was discussed <a href="#narrow/stream/219941-Machine-Learning.20for.20Theorem.20Proving/topic/Coq.20machine.20learning.20dataset.20based.20on.20MathComp.201.2E9.2E0">elsewhere</a> on Lean's Zulip.</p>
<p>We believe similar techniques can easily be applicable to Lean files (especially Lean 4, through its accessible ASTs). Our main limitation right now that we don't handle hierarchical formatting of proof scripts. We would welcome any feedback from the Lean ML community on this, in particular how one can define features to expose formatting/indenting based on the proof goal structure.</p>
<p>The best idea I have right now is that one could attach a tuple or list of integers, e.g., "(2, 3)" or "2 3", to tokens inside a tactic expression that is operating on the 3rd subgoal of the 2nd subgoal. But there is likely a general way to handle this, perhaps even across proof assistants like Lean and Coq.</p>

<p>It is not customary to indent tactic scripts in Lean based on the goal structure.  If you have multiple goals, then it is common practice to put each of the subgoal into a <code>{ ... }</code> block (which ensures that the goal is solved).</p>

<p>what does <code>/- two subgoals at the top -/</code> mean? After a <code>{</code> there is always exactly one goal. If the result of running <code>ring</code> produces two goals then it is conventional to put <code>ring, { proof1 }, { proof2 }</code> after it, otherwise (if there is only one goal) we just write <code>ring, proof</code></p>

<p>But this is not mandated by Lean itself, right? You would have to use a linter or similar to enforce this? One goal of our work was to learn (in lieu of specifying precisely) when subgoals should be newlined, e.g., based on discussion here one could either write:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">ring</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">ring</span> <span class="o">},</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">ring</span> <span class="o">}</span>

<span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">ring</span> <span class="o">}</span>

<p>But I guess you might be already be using linting to get the latter?</p>

<p>thanks, that's very helpful. I guess the only way to figure out if adding the proof goal structure as a feature will actually help Lean formatting is to do a machine learning eval, then. It might go either way here, but for Coq it was very clear that we were missing a lot of indents/newlines</p>

<p>This is definitely the state we are in with Lean 3.  I've written some tools, and am writing more, to work with Lean programmatically, but definitely it is not possible to parse a Lean file by itself without recreating Lean.  (Lean has an export format, but it throws too much away for machine learning.  It's only good for checking proofs with external checkers.)  I know Lean 4 is supposed to have an intermediate AST layer.  I don't know if that will be easy to access or work with.  I've been told it is, but I haven't seen any examples proving it.</p>

<p>Looking at the two Coq files, Lean doesn't have the same issue with indentation in the the tactic scripts.  Tactics should be indented if and only if they are in a <code>{}</code> block.  But the <code>end</code> still needs to be on a new line with the same indentation as the <code>begin</code>.</p>

<p>I think lean tactic fomatting should be about as simple as formatting languages like java, once you get the relevant parsing info</p>

<p>We currently use SerAPI to serialize Coq files, to obtain both ASTs and tokens as S-expressions (it uses OCaml PPX metaprogramming): <a href="https://github.com/ejgallego/coq-serapi">https://github.com/ejgallego/coq-serapi</a></p>

<p>the only thing that might require more intelligence in tactic formatting is determining when to put a newline after a tactic, i.e.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>  <span class="n">tac1</span><span class="o">,</span>
  <span class="n">tac2</span><span class="o">,</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>vs</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>  <span class="n">tac1</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">tac2</span><span class="o">,</span>

<p>however, a decent number of users just put line breaks after every tactic and that's not an unreasonable style (though it is a bit vertically verbose)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="198375">@Karl Palmskog</span> what specifically do you need from Lean to do this?  The lean server can provide some information like which tactic state a character is associated with, but in my experience it is slow and it is not always aligned correctly. Also it canâ€™t handle hierarchical states like tactics inside tactics.  Alternately, one can modify the interactive lean code (which governs the behavior of tactics) to record positions.  If I recall, you might be able to record the starting and ending positions of tactics using that.  This is more accurate but involves a bit of hacking (just the Lean, not the C++).  There are probably other approaches as well.</p>
