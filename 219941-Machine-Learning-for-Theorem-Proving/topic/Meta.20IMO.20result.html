<p>Meta's blog post on their IMO result mentions far stronger results than their paper on Hyper Tree Proof Search -- 10/20 IMO problems solved and miniF2F solve rate of 60% vs 2/20 IMO problems solved and solve rate of ~40ish%. What's been added with the new result? Just more compute or a new technique?</p>

<p>IMHO, miniF2F mentioned in their paper that equivalent formalization is not always possible. For example, today when reading <code>Formal Mathematics Statement Curriculum Learning</code>, they said that their version of <code>imo_1961_p1</code> is indeed a weaker version as well.</p>

<p>All I'm saying is that most people who know what the acronym "IMO" means in this context will assume that "IMO problem" means "problem which appeared on the IMO" rather than any of the other interpretations which people might want to give it, eg "problem which is simpler than an IMO problem" or "problem which did not appear on the IMO".</p>

<p>Not to make a controversy, but while "equivalent problem is not always possible" <em>excluding</em> problems without equivalent formalization is easy.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="266304">@Siddhartha Gadgil</span> Totally agree. Indeed I am also feeling the claim that someone solve X IMO questions while it is indeed much weaker version is not good. I personally wrongly thought it meant the <em>real</em> IMO when firstly read those papers as well, and it is really misleading.</p>

<p>Looking at that miniF2F file it appears to have the same issue with problems being misidentified as IMO problems as mathzoo does (see my remarks in a comment on <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/15621">#15621</a>). <code>imo_2007_p6</code> there is not IMO 2007 problem 6, it's shortlist problem A6.</p>
<p>I think that when IMO Grand Challenge rules are established, they should include (a) detailed conventions for writing formal statements of problems, (b) independent review of those formal statements, including but not limited to agreement among all entrants using the same theorem proving system; (c) if it turns out afterwards that the formal statement is not a correct translation of the informal one, or that it gives more information than it should, any entrant using that formal statement automatically scores 0 on that problem; (d) if a problem cannot be stated reasonably idiomatically using definitions already present in the standard libraries of the theorem proving system being used before the start of that IMO, no scores can be awarded on that problem; (e) entrants must make a public declaration before the start of the IMO that they intend to enter that year's IMO Grand Challenge and that they will promptly publish their results (even if all scores are 0).</p>
<p>Detailed conventions and review could be applied to statements from past IMOs being used outside the IMO Grand Challenge (but for pre-2006 IMOs it would be a good idea to check multiple sources to confirm the proper form of the informal problem statement as far as possible, there may be some mistakes in the older statements on imo-official and they may not all correspond to the English wording used at the time - pre-1967 probably didn't have English wording used at the time at all).</p>

<p>There are quite a few issues with miniF2F naming. I spotted ~5 naming issues with it. There have been ~40 fixes (formal statements) to v1. The cleanest, newest version is here: <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/miniF2F">https://github.com/facebookresearch/miniF2F</a>.</p>
<p>The specific issue with IMO 2007 P6 was corrected about 1 month ago in here as well: <br>
<a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/miniF2F/blob/5271ddec788677c815cf818a06f368ef6498a106/lean/src/test.lean#L231">https://github.com/facebookresearch/miniF2F/blob/5271ddec788677c815cf818a06f368ef6498a106/lean/src/test.lean#L231</a><br>

<p>The problem is that previous papers all used the initial version of miniF2F (v1) for benchmarking. Therefore it's impossible to compare with previous results if we changed the benchmark. Going forward, we should really use this version instead.</p>

<p>It's kind of the default dataset for ML folks, I think because it is lightweight, more or less standalone, and covers multiple proof assistants. We ML people like to work on algorithms that hopefully generalise to more than one proof assistant.</p>
<p>The hope is to grow miniF2F to more than what it has currently and make sure that they are correct. To ensure that, we really need some help from the community - spotting and fixing  the errors in miniF2F v1 was due to a wide effort between Yutaka, Daniel, Kunhao, Wenda, Guillaume, Timothee, Marie-Anne, and myself. The more inspection and discussion about rigour and difficulty the better! I really hope one day we can make very confident claims about what we can solve. So the above discussion is really appreciated and thanks to everyone in advance!</p>
<p>The benchmark is supported and maintained here: <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/miniF2F">https://github.com/facebookresearch/miniF2F</a> because it's now difficult to merge things in the original OpenAI-maintained directory.</p>

<p>All these issues I think help show the merits of the high standards of mathlib review - and with having a single community-associated place (the mathlib repository) where the review takes place and everything goes into a highly integrated whole, rather than repositories associated with one particular AI group that we're now learning get abandoned as individuals move on.

<p>I think the mathlib archive is an appropriate place to have formal <em>solutions</em> to all 380 past IMO problems (and other competitions, shortlist problems, etc. if people wish to add them).

<p>(There's also a case for having statements without proofs in a separate repository even after proofs are in the mathlib archive, because those statements can follow whatever conventions are agreed for the IMO Grand Challenge when the mathlib archive might follow different conventions in some cases. E.g. when the problem asks you to determine some answer (for which there have been various past discussions of how to represent this in a formal IMO Grand Challenge statement), in the mathlib archive it's actually reasonable to just prove the result with the answer inserted, but that version of the statement makes things easier than desired if given to an AI solver.)</p>

<p>I wholeheartedly agree. It would be awesome to have some review system to host such things systematically.</p>
<p>On a related issue: can we add a tag in the comments of the past IMO <strong>solutions</strong> such that for machine learning we can easily filter them out from the training data? There has been some concern over whether the language models have seen and memorised the informal answers. Personally I really do not think that's the case having seen the models being robust to large perturbations in the questions. But if that can be done, the AI success will be more convincing.</p>

<p>I was worried that some data crawling schemes (not operated by us) may not preserve the filename. So a tag is something nice to have so we can be <strong>very sure</strong> to filter them out. Otherwise we can do some manual filtering based on file contents, e.g., if content contains "imo" then drop.</p>

<p>Hi all! Thanks for the issues raised and discussions! It's good to see how large the room is for improvement in the quality of miniF2F and the direction of working on it.</p>
<p>Totally second bringing more community efforts/review pipelines into the development of miniF2F, e.g. enhancing review process/pipelines and hosting it in a community-share place. In the very beginning, Stan, Jesse &amp; I wanted miniF2F to evolve in a community-driven way to benefit AI people working on different ITPs. And along the year miniF2F has received many fixes. Since Stan &amp; Jesse are moving on with other stuff, to make that happen help from the community is super appreciated. Let me know how I can help!</p>

<p>Also, it would be important for maintainers to have a clear sense of the needs of a machine learning benchmark.  For example, now that this is an established benchmark, it is an issue for the tests to be change even if they are buggy.  Clear versioning would be needed for any major changes.  The other concern is having tools to prevent any benchmarks from ending up in the training data.  Some datasets for example use "canary GUIDs" for this purpose.  Albert's tags are another way.</p>

<p>My suggestion of a leanprover-community repository wasn't so much for MiniF2F (or a machine learning benchmark at all), as for a hypothetical project to formalize many olympiad problem statements (without solutions - I think solutions belong in the mathlib archive), following consistent conventions for the translation between formal and informal statements and with careful review. This would probably need to go hand in hand with two other things: writing down the detailed conventions being used for that translation and proposed for the IMO Grand Challenge (every time some question arises about the right formal expression of some informal concept, or whether to go for a more literal translation or one that's more idiomatic in Lean, the question would need to be discussed and the conclusion written down and applied to existing and new formalizations), and tracking the cases where a clean Lean statement corresponding closely to the informal statement depends on some concepts, or linkages between concepts, that currently aren't in mathlib and so will need to be added to mathlib (with associated API, as usual for adding any definition, rather than just adding a definition in isolation without any API, so adding some problems to such a repository might wait quite a long time until mathlib has the required API).</p>
<p>Such a project would expect tests to change if found to be buggy, or if the conventions change, or if the original formalization was based on a paraphrase of the original version of an older problem and the original English (or other original language) version of the problem is subsequently confirmed, so allowing a more faithful conversion to Lean. So it might be better as a source from which problems can be taken for a machine learning benchmark than for direct use as such a benchmark.</p>

<p>Just my two cents: In addition to being under facebook or leancommunity, from my experience of open source, it seems common to create another same-named GitHub organization and let the organization own minif2f (e.g. organization named minif2f). Many popular open-source library that is not created by a single person does so, such as <a href="https://github.com/flutter/flutter">https://github.com/flutter/flutter</a> (even though it is Google's official product).</p>

<p>Great suggestion! I'm not currently affiliated with Facebook and I like the idea of having a "high council of ITP gurus in Lean, Isabelle, Coq, and HOL Light". </p>
<p>I am still torn though because on the one hand, currently at Facebook there's a big team working on theorem proving and can maintain the benchmark quite well. Secondly, it's entirely open-sourced so should be fairly easy if it needs to be moved elsewhere. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the community-driven advantage is pretty clear: it won't stop simply because people move to different companies.</p>
<p>To me the most ideal situation is to form a Github organisation as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="563306">@Tom Chen</span> suggested that involves Kunhao, someone from Facebook, and experts in Coq and HOL Light too. This needs some time and drive from someone who volunteers to do it. I think the ML for formal maths community will really benefit a lot from it. Currently I don't have the capacity to take on such a project but if in 3-4 months time nobody else does, I can do it.</p>

<p>many thanks to Jason for summarizing the discussion in the Coq Zulip here. A move to leanprover-community for this repo would also lower the bar for adding, for example, Coq equivalents to the benchmarks, since we would know there is somebody in the organization who could review and merge PRs for the long term.</p>

<p>For the specific case of <em>conventions</em> for formalizing problems (but maybe not the problems themselves), there's also the IMO-grand-challenge organization. I don't think the IMO Grand Challenge should be considered Lean-specific, even if it's currently described as such. Much of the formalization conventions for the IMO Grand Challenge would be independent of the particular system being used - it would be describing generally applicable principles for filling in details left out by informal problem statements, such as exactly what type to use for variables and explicitly representing things that are implicit from e.g. an informal statement doing a division implying it's not dividing by zero. (See the paper that noted their ML system claimed a solution to an IMO problem, that on further inspection was wrong because the formal version of the problem incorrectly used truncating <code>nat</code> subtraction - avoiding truncating subtraction and division would be on the list of general formalization issues included in such conventions.) And then there would be more specific translations for specific constructs to use in each system. Ultimately, for any ambiguity concerning a particular problem (whether a past problem or a future one when actually running the IMO Grand Challenge) the aim would be for all systems to agree on the detailed interpretation being used for formalization (e.g. whether a variable is a natural number or an integer required to be nonnegative; whether two points in a geometry problem are specified as different or whether the solver must prove that if required).</p>

<p>Hello,<br>
Here's my two cents coming from ML rather than formalisation. I think finding good ways to be faithful to the complexity of IMO problems is important, but we (as in, the meta team working on neural theorem proving) are completely unqualified to do this.Furthermore, current problems in benchmarks like MiniF2F are already out of reach for our systems, so we'd rather spend time</p>

<p>As a concrete proposal, I suggest that versions of "determine" problems that tell the solver what it needs to prove, when a human contestant would have had to work out that answer themselves, should be named e.g. <code>imo_2006_p3_easy_mode</code> to avoid the name giving the misleading impression that what's asked is actually equivalent to an IMO problem. That way, such "easy mode" variants of problems would still be available for ML use, but avoiding the present misrepresentation of the nature of the problems.</p>

<p>I definitely expect that precise translations of competition problem statements into Lean or other systems following agreed conventions for such translations, and writing such conventions, should involve collaboration with people with expertise in competition problems and in formalization rather than just being done by ML people.</p>

<p>I think it would be a good idea for the IMO Grand Challenge to start running officially <em>before</em> any entrants think they are likely to solve any problems - and benchmarks of too-hard-at-present problems provide something to aim for. Negative results are worthwhile results in science, and "all entrants scored 0 for five years before any entrant solved a real problem in the IMO Grand Challenge" gives more information than "no-one entered the IMO Grand Challenge for 20 years until someone asked to enter once they were confident their AI could solve a majority of IMO problems".</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="266253">@Joseph Myers</span> while you can propose it, I’m not sure in what state the IMO grand challenge is in and if it will ever run before there is a system out there good enough to make non-negligible progress. Of course anyone can organize such a challenge, but I think the hard work is convincing folks to participate with their models.</p>
<p>Also, all the “rules” of the original IMOGC would have to be modified to reflect the current state of research.  Open source models are unlikely to be the first models to realistically do well.  Also I don’t know if just having problems in just Lean is a good idea.  First, I think there is good reason to ask for the problem in both Lean and natural language.  I also think there is reason to want to include other ITPs, like Isabelle and Coq (or whatever ITP the participating models use).</p>

<p>I said above that I don't think it should be Lean-specific, and the rules should be up for discussion in general. The fact that AIs have solved some older IMO or IMO-easy-mode problems - even if those problems are easier than would now be likely to appear as problems 1 or 4 - <em>is</em> to my mind evidence that there's enough chance of an existing AI solving a new IMO problem - maybe 1% or 2% for each future problem 1 or 4 that's algebra or number theory? - that it would be worth having a competition if anyone would enter, even if there's a 99% chance they all score 0.</p>

<p>Human IMO contestants get the problems in up to three languages (at least one of which must be an official language - English, French, German, Russian, Spanish), so it seems fair for IMO Grand Challenge entrants to be able to get an informal version as well (and in principle a third version, whether formal or informal, though I don't know that that would be of any use to the entrants).</p>

<p>By involving <em>new</em> problems (and given a requirement that the AI code is frozen and receives no more training between the start of the IMO for human contestants and when the AI sits the IMO Grand Challenge), the IMO Grand Challenge addresses the concern about whether a machine learning system might have seen a solution somewhere to an existing problem it's finding a formal solution to. There are many national and regional olympiads out there that also use new problems and with a range of difficulty levels, so any of them could be used for something similar to the IMO Grand Challenge - provided the entrants commit in public that they will be doing such a challenge based on a particular olympiad, before the human contestants sit that olympiad.</p>

<p>To be clear: I do think negative results (i.e., zero scores) are very important for science, and they should be made public afterwards.</p>

<p>I should also point out that a major premise of the IMO grand challenge is that for a computer to do well on the IMO (and for a human to trust the computer's solution) it has to give a formal proof.  Models like Minerva (and even ChatGPT) are starting to cast doubt on that assumption.  (Although models like Draft Sketch Prove  (<a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="219941" href="/#narrow/stream/219941-Machine-Learning-for-Theorem-Proving/topic/More.20papers.20on.20autoformalization">#Machine Learning for Theorem Proving &gt; More papers on autoformalization</a>)  also show the two approaches are quite compatible and systems which generate informal proofs convert them to formal theorem proofs are a nice symbiosis.)</p>

<p>Why do you say that even ChatGPT starts to cast doubt on that assumption?<br>
If anything, it has strengthened my belief that I'll only believe a computer-generated proof if it is formally verified. ChatGPT is way too good at bullshitting.</p>

<p>Before Minerva, I was 99% sure the first computer solutions to the IMO grand challenge would be formal.  After, I'm 80% sure.  As for BS, the question is if that is a fundamental property of large language model applications, or if it can be fixed (without having to formalize everything in a formal system).</p>

<p>(To be clear, I don't think ChatGPT itself, especially the current version, would do well.)</p>
