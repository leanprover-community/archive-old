<p>A colleague of mine pointed me to this article: <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2278276-an-ai-has-disproved-five-mathematical-conjectures-with-no-human-help">https://www.newscientist.com/article/2278276-an-ai-has-disproved-five-mathematical-conjectures-with-no-human-help</a><br>
It's behind a firewall, but the paper and the code are freely available on the author's website: <a href="http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~adamwagner/index.html">http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~adamwagner/index.html</a><br>
It's the first paper listed. It looks really impressive to me...</p>

<p>I think someone posted Gowers' tweet about it in another thread. What I like about it is that they got the AI to look for potential counterexamples and then they <em>actually looked at the output</em> -- the graphs which the AI thought were promising -- and spotted the patterns and then went on to find the actual counterexamples themselves. They were lucky that the counterexamples had some structure.</p>

<p>There are other proofs in graph theory which use random techniques, i.e. estimates to show that a probability that a graph with a million nodes has property X is a little less than 1, and hence there must be some counterexample</p>
