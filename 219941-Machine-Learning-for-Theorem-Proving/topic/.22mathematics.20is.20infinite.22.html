<p>I just gave a talk at some CERN conference and I mentioned AI and the possibility of computers proving theorems. Two basic questions came up about this after the talk and I wasn't really in a position to answer them :-(</p>
<p>The first one I can only half remember -- it was "are the AI techniques which are used to try and solve mathematics analytical techniques or...something else". I know that people have posted a whole host of technical information in this stream but I know 0 about AI. Is there a simple answer to this question?</p>
<p>The second question I understand much better. This goes back to a conversation I had with Leo some time ago, where he said that his impression was that the AI people were saying "well we've done board games, so maths is next". Leo was arguing that getting AI to play maths well was far far far harder than getting it to play chess/go well, and I'm sure he's right, but my interpretation of the main reasons why this was the case was that (1) mathematics is infinite, so we have infinitely many possibilities for our moves at any stage, and (2) the payoff function is 0/1 -- either you've proved it or you haven't. In the questions afterwards, someone challenged me on (1): they said sure maths was infinite, but go was big enough to be considered infinite in practice. Can one really leverage the fact that there are "only" 300 or so moves that one can make in a typical go position, whereas one really can add x to both sides of an equation for infinitely many x?</p>
<p>Sorry for the vague questions! My impression is that the AI people are getting more and more interested in Lean (e.g. I'm meeting someone from Facebook later on this week who wants to talk about Lean and AI) so I'd better know something :-)</p>

<p>You can certainly express theorem proving such that it has a finite branching factor, and I agree with the person that said that go is effectively infinite, we aren't solving these problems by exhausting the space in any sense</p>

<p>To me a better argument of the hardness of maths is that it is <em>the hardest problem</em> in a formal sense, like NP complete problems. There is a theorem whose provability is equivalent to finding an optimal strategy in go</p>

<p>Now you might say that just because there are really hard problems in the space doesn't mean that the interesting problems are there, we might just get lucky and avoid those areas. But mathematicians are attracted to hard problems, so this is probably too optimistic</p>

<p>Someone else asked "what are you going to do about the fact that there are undecidable statements?" and here I was more confident, my reply was "mathematicians are attracted to problems which we believe are decidable".</p>

<p>while mathematicians like to stick to the decidable statements, they also like to toe arbitrarily close to the line separating them from the undecidable statements, so from a computational point of view it doesn't make a difference and may as well be undecidable</p>

<p>One thing that I don't understand is why people believe these approaches have to either be fully automated or not work at all. I think something like Github's co-pilot for formalized mathematics could be reasonably attainable with current technologies and would help a lot even though it probably won't come out with an automagic proof of the Riemann Hypothesis or such.</p>

<p>The scary branching factor when writing a tactic proof is at the <code>have</code> statements. Looking at proofs mathematicians write (either in lean or on paper), often there are steps where something unexpected is introduced by a <code>have</code>. However often there is a perfectly reasonable motivation, but I worry that we never write this down in a tactic proof (and all too infrequently in paper proofs, too).</p>
<p>I like the example we like to use in Lean demos, of the infinitude of primes. It's not actually the most trivial argument: there are two "surprise" steps in the version used in demos (<code>let M := N.factorial + 1</code> and <code>let p := min_fac M</code>). How does one write down an account of this proof that doesn't reach for surprises? Reasonably you decide to proceed by contradiction, and after a bit of tidying up you have an N such that all primes are &lt; N, and quite plausibly decide to try to construct a prime &gt;= N. It's not too big a leap to then try to construct a number &gt;= N which is not divisible by any prime. At this point you could either notice you've got a finite list of primes to avoid, or you could decide to construct something "easier" given the context, i.e. a number &gt;= N which is not divisible by anything &lt; N. Still, making that "not too big a leap" seems hard for a ML prover, and finishing from this point without access to "surprises"/<code>have</code> statements is still quite challenging.</p>

<p>I guess you're right, no-one is stating that explicitly, but to me it sounds like the implicit assumption in discussions like the one Kevin Buzzard is describing above, when talking about things like "solving mathematics" or the fact that some problems are undecidable. </p>
<p>Perhaps indeed a better question is how far are we from having AI come up with novel and creative proofs, using things like the unexpected <code>have</code> steps you discuss above.</p>

<p>I have discussed this question with many AI people and mathematicians, and all agreed that the branching factor is far far larger for mathematical proof than for Go.  Even if one does not consider options like "add a specific number x to both sides of the equation", the number of "functions from the library" times "candidate function arguments of the right type in the current context" is large.  But so is the number of words in the English language, yet state of the art transformer language models generate grammatical and very plausible English sentences,<br>
though not very meaningful ones.   By itself the language model can achieve local coherence but not global, nor can it plan very well.<br>
The combination of LM and formal verifier has the great advantage that the LM just has to get the right answer with &gt; 1% probability or so, then the verifier picks a correct one.  OpenAI's code generating system Codex works this way, see their paper or the demo at <br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGUCcjHTmGY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGUCcjHTmGY</a><br>
I think the state of the art is well represented by OpenAI's work, besides Codex and gptf see <a href="https://openai.com/blog/grade-school-math/">https://openai.com/blog/grade-school-math/</a></p>

<p>If I may add a bit of color on the "infinitude of maths" vs "infinitude of go" one way of seeing that there is a very big difference is the following: </p>
<p>Go action space is very finite (19x19) but larger than Chess which leads to a very high branching factor which leads to basic search procedures being quite intractable, and that's what people call Go's "infinite or very large search space". Maths on the other end has not only a very very large search space but they also have an actually infinite action space: you have an infinite choice at each action / branch in the search space (as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> pointed out this is well illustrated by cut introduction which are crucial in order to construct tractable proofs (I believe there's a theorem that say you can get away without cuts but your proof size explodes??).</p>
<p>You could eventually reframe maths as a finite action space, just write the proof and the action is just the next token, but here we see that the search space explodes as well as the length of a proof becomes very challenging (one tactic being roughly the size of a full chess game).</p>
<p>This well-behaved action space vs infinite action space is one of the crucial difference we have to deal with when applying AI techniques to Maths compared to Go. The other big one is that there is no obvious way to do self play, you're playing against statements instead of an opponent and if one statement is too hard there is no obvious game setup that will let you reframe it to make it easier. Self-play gives you that smooth curriculum in games which is also crucial to train neural networks.</p>
<p>Initial AI x Maths systems actually approximated the infinite action space with a finite one by limiting it to the space of "Tactics x Known Theorems" but these systems where not capable of introducing cuts or witnesses (from far away they're one and the same) whose mathematical terms are exogenous to the current context (eg <code>let p := min_fac M</code> the term <code>min_fac M</code> is nowhere to be found in the context as we tackle that proof). This is what we were motivated to tackle heads-on when we introduced GPT-f which uses a language model to sample plausible actions from that infinite action space and apply search on top of that.</p>

<p>The point I was feebly attempting to make above was that although <code>let p := min_fac M</code> appears "completely out of the blue" / "exogenous to the current context", there is of course some thinking going on that makes it quite plausible. Unfortunately this thinking is not in any way reflected in the tactic script, so an ML agent, language model driven or otherwise, has little opportunity to learn to imitate it because there is no training data.</p>
<p>(The thought comes after having decided to look at <code>let M := N.factorial + 1</code> e.g. because it is coprime to all possible primes. "Hmm, but how are we going to prove it is prime? One option would be to notice and use the lemma that if you're not prime, you're divisible by some prime. Another option would be to not use <code>M</code> itself, but some prime extracted from it that is still big enough, so let's look for functions that take a natural number and produce a prime." Either option is a viable path to a proof. In the second option, it's completely plausible without a large branch factor to notice <code>min_fac</code>. But it is generating/evaluating those two options that seems very hard to train.)</p>

<p>I'm not familiar with the state of the art in AI-assisted mathematics, but to what extent can you precisely characterize a metric for saying AI is good at math?  Go has the easy route of playing AI against itself while textual generation like gpt-3 also has metrics.  With math do you delete all lemmas and hope the AI proves the theorem along with identifying them?</p>

<p>The usual performance measure for provers is the fraction of statements taken from a benchmark list which the system can prove.<br>
For serious competitions (e.g. see <a href="http://www.tptp.org/CASC/">http://www.tptp.org/CASC/</a>) each system is run on the same computer with the same time limit.<br>
For the systems used in CS (SAT solvers, first order logic provers) one gives all of the required axioms with each statement.<br>
For a system with a large mathematical library like Lean or Mizar, one usually splits the library into two sets of lemmas, a training set and a testing set.  The system can see the training statements and their proofs, and do whatever it wants with them to learn how to do proofs.<br>
Then it is given the testing statements and it has to come up with their proofs by interacting with the prover.<br>
The best results I've heard of are around 75% , e.g. see Josef Urban's group (for Mizar) <a href="https://github.com/ai4reason/ATP_Proofs">https://github.com/ai4reason/ATP_Proofs</a><br>
or the "Large Theory Batch" results (for Isabelle) in <a href="http://www.tptp.org/CASC/28/WWWFiles/DivisionSummary1.html">http://www.tptp.org/CASC/28/WWWFiles/DivisionSummary1.html</a> <br>
There has been steady progress but clearly still some ways to go.<br>
Other aspects of automated math such as generating conjectures, search engines etc. are not yet as systematized.<br>
A similar benchmark approach is always used but the test problems and other details vary from work to work.</p>

<p>Here is a shot at a setup for reinforcement learning.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple form - generate statements in order of increasing complexity and try to prove or disprove them.</li>
<li>Adversarial form (like GANs) - one system generates simple statements that the other cannot prove/disprove (points won when problems cannot be solved, more points for simpler statements).</li>
<li>Competition - generate statements that a system can prove/disprove and challenge the other system - points if the other system cannot solve it.</li>
</ul>
<p>One needs refinements clearly because of logical dependencies of statements - one can make infinitely many hard problems of the form P =&gt; Riemann hypothesis so long as P is true. So reducing one posed problem to another should be a "solution"</p>

<p>I agree complexity is not canonical, but depends on the generating rules and the (weighted) initial generators. One should take reursion and definitions of inductive types as generating rules, so that is not horribly complex with nothing else.</p>
<p>What I feel is a reasonable option is to take a generating set and generating rules corresponding to occurence in mathlib (traded off with entropy of generators).</p>

<p><code>suggest</code> ranks merely by length of the pretty printed term. (<code>suggest</code> tries to apply a lemma from the library with the visible head symbol in the goal, then tries to discharge subgoals using <code>solve_by_elim</code>). <code>library_search</code> just filters <code>suggest</code> for results that successfully close all subgoals, and returns at most one solution.</p>

<p>Can't the competing AIs just pick theorems from mathlib instead of generating them? Theorems like in mathlib are the ones we care about.  In some perverse way, there is not "much" of a difference between generating an integer to index theorems in mathlib and generating an integer that encodes syntactically correct statement.<br>
This way you do not have to worry about what are the interesting theorems and you have a natural measure of complexity by measuring the portion of mathlib the theorem depends on.</p>

<p>I think that auto-generating this stuff would be great. I recognise that this is not a trivial task however. There is a disconnect between what is easy to auto-generate, and what is considered "interesting enough for inclusion in an informal maths text".</p>

<p>You can play a two player game and then figure out who won. If you randomly apply tactics to a goal and change it to another goal, how can you tell if you're winning? Fermat's last theorem looks like a very nice goal to reduce a problem to because it's short and it's a simple statement about the naturals. Are we winning if we reduce the goal to this?</p>

<p>I don't know a thing about AI, so I currently can't be of much help about how to autogenerate this stuff.</p>

<p>I was thinking about something along the lines of <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-were-the-renaissance-mathematics-competitions-in-Italy">renaissance mathematics competitions in Italy</a>. That is a two player game.</p>

<p>I'm not so sure that it is -- if you're happy to let an AI generate questions then that's fine, but I'm not convinced that a machine which has been trained to solve questions generated by another machine will be then able to solve 95% of mathlib. But again I'm no expert. I agree that generating theorems and then generating solutions makes a good two player game. I think Facebook are having some success with this method.</p>

<p>Just for context, the original Go champion software Alpha Go learnt by <em>behaviour cloning</em> - trying to make the same moves as experts, before refining by self-play. Alpha Go Zero went beyond this. Mathematics being much harder it makes sense to try to have behaviour cloning as a learning component instead of jumping in to try pure self-play.</p>

<p>If I may add a bit of color on the "infinitude of maths" vs "infinitude of go" one way of seeing that there is a very big difference is the following: </p>
<p>Go action space is very finite (19x19) but larger than Chess which leads to a very high branching factor which leads to basic search procedures being quite intractable, and that's what people call Go's "infinite or very large search space". Maths on the other end has not only a very very large search space but they also have an actually infinite action space: you have an infinite choice at each action / branch in the search space (as <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="110087">Scott Morrison</span> pointed out this is well illustrated by cut introduction which are crucial in order to construct tractable proofs (I believe there's a theorem that say you can get away without cuts but your proof size explodes??).</p>
<p>You could eventually reframe maths as a finite action space, just write the proof and the action is just the next token, but here we see that the search space explodes as well as the length of a proof becomes very challenging (one tactic being roughly the size of a full chess game).</p>
<p>This well-behaved action space vs infinite action space is one of the crucial difference we have to deal with when applying AI techniques to Maths compared to Go. The other big one is that there is no obvious way to do self play, you're playing against statements instead of an opponent and if one statement is too hard there is no obvious game setup that will let you reframe it to make it easier. Self-play gives you that smooth curriculum in games which is also crucial to train neural networks.</p>
<p>Initial AI x Maths systems actually approximated the infinite action space with a finite one by limiting it to the space of "Tactics x Known Theorems" but these systems where not capable of introducing cuts or witnesses (from far away they're one and the same) whose mathematical terms are exogenous to the current context (eg <code>let p := min_fac M</code> the term <code>min_fac M</code> is nowhere to be found in the context as we tackle that proof). This is what we were motivated to tackle heads-on when we introduced GPT-f which uses a language model to sample plausible actions from that infinite action space and apply search on top of that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess this is still very useful in interactive theorem proving, if we can let the user introduce cuts but left everything else to a search procedure (imagine if I could just write a sequence of <code>have</code> statements without bothering to provide justification for each one...) Anyway, when the automation is still weak, most time are spent on the "leaf-level" of proofs, so even a small improvement can lead to much better results.</p>
<p>And afaik things like "add x to both sides" can be made finite, as one always does so in order to make some theorems applicable later on, so instead of enumerating x we can enumerate the next theorem used, find out how much freedom is left on the choice of x, then apply the theorem and goes on to enumerate the next theorem etc. (which is the idea of "tableaux with unification"?) Though the branching factor is still proportional to the number of premises (theorems)...</p>
