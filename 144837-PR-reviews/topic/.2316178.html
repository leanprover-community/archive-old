<p>The linting step on this PR is taking forever (please don't cancel it just yet). It's nearing 6 hours, but this is the third time it has been slow. I think the first run failed due to disconnection; the second time it ran for 2 hours before I canceled, thinking it silently disconnected; the third time it ran for 5 hours before I again canceled, thinking it must surely fix itself; this is the fourth run and it's been almost 6 hours. I've never seen a linting step take more than 45 minutes or so. Any diagnosis or help is appreciated.</p>

<p>Just to mention I've had the same problem over and over again.</p>
