<p>The checks "CI / build mathlib" and "CI / run tests" have failed frequently for me recently. Often I can't see particular error messages, or I'm unable to interpret them (most recently: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/runs/4225902863?check_suite_focus=true">No space left on device</a>). And I don't see any corresponding issues locally.</p>
<p>Does someone understand what is going on?</p>

<p>It might be because some of the VMs didn't have enough RAM. They're being upgraded today.</p>

<p>I hope that is the issue, and that it will now be solved.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>I just noticed that there was related discussion (pertaining to the same PR) <a href="#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/wrong.20olean.20on.20azure/near/261562580">here</a>. And from it I understand that "I don't see any corresponding issues locally" was not strictly true: I have recently had to merge master very often to get a cache with which I don't have the orange bars. So I now think these are related, although I still don't really understand what's going on.</p>
<p>But thanks, great news about the upgrade!</p>
