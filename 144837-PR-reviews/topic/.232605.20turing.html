<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> Can you explain the motivation behind the refactor? Why did you want to change the definition in the first place?</p>

<p>It's more like a continuation of the work done in the file. I had planned to do this a while ago but got sidetracked. Basically, when you use <code>list</code> instead of <code>list_blank</code>, you have to keep track of how many blanks you have left on the tape as a result of moving over them and back again. This version has less definitional equality so more rewriting is involved, but the constructions are simpler.</p>
