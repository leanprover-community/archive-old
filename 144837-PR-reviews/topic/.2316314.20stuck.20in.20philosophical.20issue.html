<p><a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/16314">#16314</a> seems essentially stuck for a reason not related to the core purpose of the PR: namely, whether or not an iff lemma is better with or without explicit arguments. The PR makes a change to an existing lemma.</p>
<p>I have a PR that has been stuck for some time because I need a finalised version of this one to work from, and I don't really care about this philosophical issue, and it seems the submitter and the current primary reviewer can't agree.</p>
<p>As such, I was wondering if the discussion on this philosophical point could be moved to here, a consensus reached, and thus movement to occur on this PR. I hope that's a reasonable thing to post about.</p>

<p>I am currently considering removing the dependency of my infsep PR on this one, and creating a new one that implements the needed functionality - it's slightly absurd that a PR created specifically to be a fairly straightforward addition for a more complicated one to use has taken a month to do anything. To be entirely honest it's left me pretty disillusioned with this project as a whole.</p>
