<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> has done the great job of immediately emptying the <code>init_/</code> folder (with the algebraic hierarchy that came from core) and merging it into the standard hierarchy in mathlib. But the diff is huge!<br>
I think we should prioritise this PR, because it is a mega refactor.</p>

<p>I think as Mario particularly said that this PR is just meant to do the migration, and we should defer making things "mathlib style" for a subsequent PR, if it builds, lets merge it.</p>

<p>I assume that's what happened.  But AFAICT the files were merged, and contain contents from both dates.  In this case the date should be the maximum, and the author list the union.</p>

<p>My limited understanding of this is that ... the year you write doesn't mean very much, and regardless of what you say in the copyright notice a separate legal copyright exists for each revision in any case. Arguably using the minimum year is the least correct thing to do, as that can easily be read as implying that a copyright for the current revision existed as of the minimum year.</p>

<p>Yes. It's also the reason you often see things like "Copyright 2006, 2010, 2020", which might implicitly assert there were revisions or new editions made in those particular years, and separate copyrights exist for each.</p>

<p>Good luck relicensing the stuff from Johannes (Hölzl) or Leo.  I don't expect any problems from being careless with the copyright headers, it's more a politeness thing.  Legally speaking, the biggest requirement is probably due to paragraph 4 of the license:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and<br>
(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; [...]</p>
