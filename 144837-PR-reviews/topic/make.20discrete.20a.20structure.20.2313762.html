<p>This is a boring PR about making <code>discrete</code> in the category theory library a structure. It touches lots of files, so may rot.</p>
<p>However I think it's a helpful fix: my previous efforts to clean up the <code>has_shift</code> API, in turn motivated by trying to bring bounded and derived categories over from LTE, all foundered on <code>discrete</code> leaking through the confusing ways. So I hope this boring fix will enable good things.</p>

<p>It is not a perfect PR. There is quite a bit of annoyance around having categorical products being indexed by <code>discrete walking_pair</code> now; lots of extra brackets and <code>.as</code>. I just focussed in this PR on making everything work again after making <code>discrete</code> a structure, and did not consider refactoring the categorical product API itself.</p>

<p>If anyone would like to discuss such a refactor, do it themselves, or pressure me to think about, that's all fine. But I'm hoping that it doesn't need to prevent this PR being merged. :-)</p>
