<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="246273">@Bhavik Mehta</span> do we already know, for example, that <code>structured_arrow</code> has colimits under certain conditions? All I meant in my comment in this PR is that this assertion (and the dual for costructured arrows) was missing, but it might already be somewhere else...</p>

<p>We don't - originally I didn't think that particular machinery would give results like you mention, but I realised that it actually does: We could use this to show the structured arrow category has connected colimits and the forgetful functor creates them. Non-connected colimits (eg coproducts) don't follow from this machinery though I think</p>

<p>Why connected? These categories are just special cases of comma categories, so the work you did there should specialize</p>

<p>The forgetful functor from the under category doesn't create colimits in general, only the connected ones.</p>

<p>Concretely, we have</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">instance</span> <span class="n">has_colimits_of_shape</span>
  <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">has_colimits_of_shape</span> <span class="n">J</span> <span class="n">A</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">has_colimits_of_shape</span> <span class="n">J</span> <span class="n">B</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">preserves_colimits_of_shape</span> <span class="n">J</span> <span class="n">L</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">:</span>
  <span class="n">has_colimits_of_shape</span> <span class="n">J</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">comma</span> <span class="n">L</span> <span class="n">R</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="o">{}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>in the general case, and when specialising this to structured arrow <code>structured_arrow (S : D) (T : C тед D) := comma (functor.from_punit S) T</code> we take the functor <code>L</code> to be <code>functor.from_punit _</code>, which only preserves connected colimits not general ones</p>

<p>Okay, but we can just assume that the functor preserves colimits, and worry about the connectedness condition later</p>

<p>Could you write down for me the result you're expecting to see? I don't think I follow what you mean</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="246273">@Bhavik Mehta</span> I understand now. The point I forgot was that we only have the natural <code>(co)structured_arrow.proj</code> projecting onto only one of the components of the comma construction, and the other projection is onto the <code>discrete punit</code>. So indeed the condition for these unit projections to be compatible with (co)limits would boil down to some connectedness condition. And I'm fine with this being postponed to a later PR anyway, so <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7535">#7535</a> is good to go as far as I'm concerned.</p>
