<p>Before I do anything more on this, could someone more familiar with <code>modeq</code> take a brief look to confirm that we don't already have these results in mathlib?  As an early pre-release reviewer noted, some of these results seem pretty basic and it would be surprising if they weren't already present in some form, and yet I couldn't get <code>library_search</code> to find them.</p>
