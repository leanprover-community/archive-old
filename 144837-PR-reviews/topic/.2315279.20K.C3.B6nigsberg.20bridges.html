<p>People have different opinions on whether this counts as a solution to Freek's problem. I personally don't really care. Even if it doesn't count, I would be happy to merge this PR. What do others think?</p>

<p>It feels a bit weird to have this solution in <code>100-theorems-list</code> but not update <code>100.yaml</code>, so probably we should update that. <br>
I'm not against merging this if other people think this is worth having and/or counts as a solution to the 100 problems list.</p>

<p>I've added the <code>100.yaml</code> entry.</p>
<p>Euler's solution to the Konigsberg problem was to consider sequences of letters ABCAD... such that letters are consecutive iff the corresponding bodies of land are connected by a bridge and such that unordered pairs of consecutive letters appear the correct number of times. So perhaps the more Eulerian way to model it would be a simple graph for the underlying connectivity and then look for walks whose edges are some specific multiset, rather than using multigraphs.</p>
<p>I can't possibly speak for Euler, but I imagine if we had the opportunity to ask him his opinion he'd wonder why the argument in this PR doesn't resolve the Konigsberg bridges problem.</p>

<p>I guess in some ways the reason people are hesitant is because the "theorem" behind the Köningsberg problems holds for digraphs, so people think the bridges itself must basically include a proof of that. But I'm in favour of merging this, and further I imagine that if Mathlib gets digraphs that are not <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/quiver">docs#quiver</a>, the code to adapt this proof to that should take &lt;1hr to fix.</p>

<p>All that said, I'll leave it to all of you to decide whether this is too controversial of an entry to add to the Freek list! <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span> I'm mostly happy that the simple graph library has developed enough that the proofs here are trivial.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="284160">@Eric Rodriguez</span> Be careful -- you can't use just digraphs to model this because you need mutual exclusion for the pair of edges corresponding to an unoriented edge.</p>

<p>Note that Freek himself is extremely unfussed about what "counts" as a solution to a problem. For example IIRC one of the "proofs" of pythagoras' theorem just links to a definition of dist((a,b),(c,d)):=sqrt((a-c)^2+(b-d)^2) on R^2.</p>
