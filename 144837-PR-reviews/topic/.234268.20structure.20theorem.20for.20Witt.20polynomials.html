<p>This PR  is an especially tough one to review, since it's the trickiest bit in a sequence of PRs on a topic that's probably unfamiliar to a lot of people. Is anyone willing to take it on? Maybe you know something about Witt vectors already and are curious about how Johan made them look easy, or maybe you don't and want to learn!</p>

<p>I am in teaching hell for the next two weeks but am actively interested</p>

<p>I asked my friend Jim Borger (who doesn't know Lean at all, but knows Witt vectors!) if he'd be interested in taking a look... Maybe unlikely that he'll say anything.</p>

<p>I've split off two tiny pieces: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/4437">#4437</a> and <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/4438">#4438</a>. I've also pushed more comments to this PR.<br>
If someone would like to walk through this with me in a video call, that's fine with me.<br>
In then end, it's an ugly computation about polynomials over <code>int</code> and <code>rat</code>, but it fits on one screen. The rest should be reasonably easy and clear.</p>

<p>It's good timing for me -- I finish teaching at the end of October and then the only thing I have to do until about April is write a Lean graduate course, so I need to think about graduate level Lean mathematics from Nov. (I'll also finally write the schemes paper)</p>
