<p>The PR had already been approved, when Eric suggested four extra innocuous-looking <code>simp</code> lemma.  However, these lemmas rubbed the linter the wrong way.</p>
<p>Now, CI builds <em>without</em> the <code>simp</code> tag on two of the new lemmas.</p>
<p>I would like to merge, but wanted to confirm that the issue with the linter is not a sign of something else wrong with the new instances.</p>

<p>I think it's a sign of something wrong somewhere, but given it persisted even when we manually defined the instances the right way, it doesn't look like the fault of the PR. Sorry for opening that worm can</p>

<p>No worries: it is very helpful to see what "should be expected", even when it then turns out not to work.  I find it very useful to see what does not work along with what does.</p>
