<p>I figured to eliminate the large amount of duplication between <code>monoid_algebra</code> and <code>add_monoid_algebra</code>, we need an equivalence between them. Hopefully from there a handful of theorems about <code>monoid_algebra</code> can be transferred over the equivalence to <code>add_monoid_algebra</code> in some future PRs, and the file can shrink a lot.</p>

<p>I think you're missing a lemma</p>

<p>Not related to this PR, but is there a good reason for why <code>add_monoid_algebra R M</code> is not defined as <code>monoid_algebra R (multiplicative M)</code>?</p>

<p>Because the resulting lemmas become awkward to use I think</p>

<p>I was just sick of admin. I made the branch <code>kbuzzard/mult-add-irred</code> (following your branch naming convention!) and made multiplicative and additive irreducible (and did nothing else). Course it doesn't compile, yet, but I'll keep tinkering...</p>

<p>I tried it too, when initially writing <code>monoid_algebra</code> (it used to be that <code>polynomial</code> was built directly on <code>finsupp</code>). My attempt foundered because it was too much trouble to tell Lean when I wanted it to unfold <code>multiplicative</code> and when I didn't want it do. It's possible that being more rigorous (make <code>multiplicative</code> as irreducible as possible, never ever unfold, add API to <code>multiplicative</code> as needed) would get there. On the other hand, Yury is our master refactorer ... so it's a challenge. :-)</p>

<p>This was the approach I took with <code>with_zero</code>, although I must confess I sometimes cheated and locally made it reducible in a file if I couldn't figure out how to fix a proof properly</p>
