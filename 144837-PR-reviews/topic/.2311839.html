<p>Is there something else I should do in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/11839">#11839</a>? I know it's not very interesting, but I promise it will be used for something nice! I can even make the main lemma private if we prefer. Thanks!</p>

<p>I don't think the main lemma needs to be private! This is well out of my area so I haven't tried to review it, but it looks like a reasonable approach at a glance. If there aren't comments from someone else who knows what's going on, I'm happy to merge it</p>

<p>Thanks! It's the zero step of an induction (all the other coefficients are divisible by <code>p</code>), that unfortunately it's essentially as annoying as the lemma, but this is for another PR.</p>
