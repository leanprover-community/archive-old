<p>I was starting on a followup PR depending on this one showing that a profinite set is a limit of finite sets, but accidentally pushed my files to the branch for <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7448">#7448</a> . Instead of resetting things with git, I figured the easier route is to just use <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7448">#7448</a> for this as well. So if anyone is willing to take another look at the new changes to <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7448">#7448</a>, that would be helpful! It's not that many changes really...</p>
<p>I've cleaned up the PR itself a bit. The only change which is maybe not so obvious to see in the code itself is that I renamed <code>topology/category/Profinite.lean</code> to <code>topology/category/Profinite/default.lean</code>, as this PR also introduces a new file <code>topology/category/Profinite/as_limit.lean</code>.</p>
