<p>This PR looks good to me, but I'm curious whether <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/5683/files#diff-a3eff685ad770b74f1bcdcf05056cee8226187ef0999c190de9f326cfeec38b8R113">the proof in <code>chinese_remainder'</code></a> can be made simpler at all or if this is the best we can do at the moment. It consists of 2 very similar calculations, but we don't seem to have any one-line tactics (or I am failing at applying them). Does anyone want to have a go at golfing?</p>
