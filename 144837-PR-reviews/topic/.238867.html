<p>I thought I would try to reduce the amount of <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/scripts/style-exceptions.txt">files with missing module docstrings</a>. But I got this error on the mathlib build:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Text only"><pre><span></span><code>The self-hosted runner: lena lost communication with the server. Verify the machine is running and has a healthy network connection. Anything in your workflow that terminates the runner process, starves it for CPU/Memory, or blocks its network access can cause this error.
</code></pre></div>
<p>What's going on here?</p>

<p>Sometimes the actions just fail. Runners can be restarted. In general, it's not worth it to make a short docstring for a file just to get it off of the nolints list. It's on the nolints list specifically because it doesn't yet have a detailed docstring. A barebones module docstring can be worse, because it will remove it from the list thus hiding the fact that it doesn't have a detailed docstring.</p>

<p>Ok, I guess I'll just restart.</p>

<p>I'm noticing there are a few module docstrings in the folder that are just titles, without any content at all. If I'm not going to write more comprehensive docstrings for these, should I delete them so that they go on the nolints list?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="282271">@Bolton Bailey</span> Those shorter module docstrings are probably quite old (I didn't check). In general, we just leave them around and hope that someone makes them longer.</p>
