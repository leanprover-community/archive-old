<p>This PR is already in the process of being merged, so this is really a comment for a potential followup PR... It seems that the dual assertion, i.e. the adjunction for the forgetful functor from <code>under X</code> to the original category, constructed using a coproduct, deserves to be added at some point as well.</p>
