<p>This PR had been languishing for a while, and it's now been slightly improved.  It's a corollary to another theorem, but the proof is a lot of nothing (just universe wrangling).</p>
<p>It would be make sense to eventually change everything to be in terms of cofiltered limits rather than inverse limits, and I think that will clean up the incidental complexity.  The main issue seems to be that having the theorems take a directed system as a functor from a <code>directed_order</code> makes things less flexible -- the functor wants a specific category structure, rather than, say, the one from <code>ulift</code>.  (I just don't have time right now to do this.)</p>

<p>This is being used in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7825">#7825</a> to take a statement that's true for fintypes and boost it to work for all types.  The same sort of technique can be applied to, for example, boost a proof that all finite planar graphs are 4-colorable to a proof that all planar graphs are 4-colorable.</p>
