<p>It seems we need a discussion about this PR introducing a notation for the neighborhood filter of a point in a topological space. S√©bastien says he doesn't like this notation because it could make mathlib hard to understand for an outsider. This remark leaves me speechless, but probably I was a very stupid outsider when I started.</p>

<p>The question is about the notation for neighborhoods. The current notation is <code>nhds x</code> and Patrick proposes <code>ùìù x</code>. My point is that it is barely shorter, and a newcomer (knowing Lean but not this part of mathlib) could understand that <code>nhds x</code> is talking about neighborhoods of <code>x</code>, but not what <code>ùìù x</code> is. Patrick's point is that it is nicer and shorter. What do you think?</p>

<p>I also add that things like <code>A ‚Üí‚Çê[R] B</code> are much harder to parse for an outsider. But this is all a virtual debate. Outsider don't use filters, so they don't use the neighborhood filters, and they will have to relearn all of topology anyway.</p>

<p>Maybe a compromise is that every file using a notation that is not a well known one to general mathematician  (even if the notation was imported from another file) could be encouraged to have a brief docstring at the top of the file listing the notation used, of course this is intentionally vague. It is nice to have some chance of reading a file on a phone or github without opening it in vscode sometimes.</p>

<p>I guess I don't really see how needing to learn ùìù is worth it, when <code>nhds</code> is so short. It's also obvious how to type it.<br>
The PR replaces all occurrences of <code>nhds</code> with <code>ùìù</code> (I assume), but how long will that last?</p>

<p>We could have it as a notation, but not enforce it everywhere. Note that there is also the filter <code>nhds_within</code>, that I tend to use a lot, and it would be weird to have a notation for one but not the other.</p>

<p>Why don't you want a notation for <code>nhds_within</code>? We could use <code>ùìù_{s} x</code> for <code>nhds_within x s</code> for instance. Note that I needed to open mathlib to learn the order of arguments of <code>nhds_within</code> when typing the previous sentence. With notations <code>ùìù x</code> vs <code>ùìù_{s} x</code> it's clear where is the exotic parameter.</p>

<p>As a general rule, I am not keen on notations which make things slightly shorter, but harder to understand. In the same way that in programming languages I don't like perl, and I don't like short variable names. But I understand that some people like it the other way around!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span>  has been at a conference (doing "proper mathematics") but is due back tomorrow. I've discussed this issue with him some more in the last couple of days and I'm hoping he'll have some time for Zulip once he gets back. Patrick's point with this notation is that in the perfectoid project we use this<code>ùìù</code> notation all over the place and it makes things a bit shorter especially when there are several <code>ùìù</code>'s in one line e.g. <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-perfectoid-spaces/blob/e6abc27c1a5056afdae1deb948bc6362bb8b3c38/src/for_mathlib/topological_rings.lean#L64" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-perfectoid-spaces/blob/e6abc27c1a5056afdae1deb948bc6362bb8b3c38/src/for_mathlib/topological_rings.lean#L64">here</a>. <br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110050">@Sebastien Gouezel</span> 's point is that <code>ùìù x</code> might be understood by fewer people than <code>nhds x</code>, the issue being the people who know enough about topology to know that <code>nhds</code> probably means "neighbourhoods" but not enough to know that <code>ùìù </code> is sometimes used for this. There might be no standard notation for this, but on the other hand that doesn't mean that we shouldn't use notation in mathlib. Patrick's observation that notation like <code>A ‚Üí[R] B</code> is being used already in mathlib is a pretty clear cut example of us making up notation, and we also have <code>‚Üí+*</code> for ring hom (there is also no standard notation for this in mathematics and it didn't stop us making one here) which I think is plenty of evidence that we're not scared to obfuscate slightly for the sake of having some cool notation to save typing. On the other hand Sebastien is right to point out that <code>nhds</code> exists in other contexts in mathlib and changing one might make us consider changing them all. I think that's the situation currently.</p>

<p>I really don't know what I could add, but I can rewrite things I already wrote.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think a couple of thousands years of mathematics history taught us that using notations is useful, especially when performing computations. </li>
<li>As far as I know, doing topology the way we do it in mathlib doesn't exist anywhere else. That includes Bourbaki. Bourbaki uses filters, especially neighborhood filters, everywhere, but they do very little <em>computations</em> with filters.  So they don't need notations for filters or filter operations (push forward, pull backs, products...).</li>
<li>The previous point both explain why we need a notation and why arguing that it could make the library hard to read is ridiculous. Beyond the obvious observation that reading any part of mathlib is impossible for beginners, that specific part is hard to read because its specific point of view does not exist on paper.</li>
</ul>

<p>I started using mathlib almost two years ago, and I've seen many decisions that I couldn't understand or I thought were wrong. But that rejection of using a notation for filters seems several orders of magnitude more wrong and un-understandable than anything else I've seen.</p>

<p>It seems to me that there is no argument of the form "we can't use \N because it makes the library more unreadable for beginners" because the same argument seems to rule out plenty of notation which we already use -- the category theory library is a case in point with its &lt;&lt; and what have you, and all the decorated arrows we have (ring homs, module homs, functions with finite support etc) are also an issue. It seemed to me that the main argument against the notation was that <code>nhds</code> is more easily guessable as "neighbourhoods" than \N is, and that at least <code>-&gt;+*</code> and <code>-&gt;[R]</code> are kind of guessable as ring hom and R-module hom. </p>
<p>It should also be noted that this is not an issue regarding changing the simp normal form. This is simply a question of <em>notation</em>. Are we lacking some sort of coherent strategy for when notation is good/allowed/recommended?</p>

<p>Though I cast a vote earlier, I should emphasize that I don't have a strong opinion one way or another. Notation and style are very personal things. Arguments over notation in calculus split England from the rest of Europe for much of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.</p>
<p>A general policy should be that those who are most actively developing and using a library should be happy with the notation. When people who fit in that category differ, I think each should be allowed to use the notation they prefer. Doing mathematics means getting used to different terminology and notation, and users of the topology library can easily learn to identify \N and nhds.</p>

<p>For the record, if it needs to be updated to library changes, I think the regex (with lookahead) <code>(?&lt;!_)nhds(?!_)</code> should be about right. It matches any occurrence that isn't preceded or followed by <code>_</code>.</p>
