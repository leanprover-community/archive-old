<p>About this PR: it has now been approved by one person, and reviewed by in total 5 people, and basically I was wondering what more needs to happen? Do we need approval of everyone, or is one approval enough? Happy to wait for a bit if that's necessary, but would like to know the process.</p>

<p>Everything looks good, it will be merged in the end I should think. It's simply that the maintainers are very overwhelmed right now. There are 70+ open PR's. Give it another day or two :-)</p>

<p>I think at present our bottleneck is time spent reviewing, not availability of people to click the "merge" button. Fortunately, reviewing can be done by a much bigger pool of people. I'm very happy to merge something on the basis of only a cursory read myself, if there's already been some back-and-forth with other reviewers.</p>
