<p>There was a "request review" from me. I of course like the idea of reducing code duplication in my <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/9430">#9430</a>. But I think I'm slow to understand some implications, so I thought I'd ask in Zulip.</p>
<p>(Also is the best way to review PRs to just <code>git checkout</code> the branch and have the GitHub diff in another window as a navigation aid? Thanks for helping a noob's workflow!)</p>

<p>One thing was that it was previously thought having a <code>coe</code> from <code>probability_measure</code> to both <code>finite_measure</code> and <code>measure</code> is not desirable, but with the subtype construction, one would have both. Is it clear this is not an issue? Or is it that the "subtype of subtype" approach is exactly meant to solve the problem of competing <code>coe</code>routes? Does anyone know of other places in mathlib where one uses a "subtype of subtype" with occasional need to coerce to both, and have those worked well? (Sorry for naive questions, but I'm still new to all of this.)</p>

<p>This one does not seem to involve any risks, but I'd like to understand the rationale to improve my own Leaning... What is the difference between introducing<br>
<code>variables {α : Type*} {m : measurable_space α}</code><br>
instead of  <code>variables {α : Type*} [measurable_space α]</code>?</p>
<p>Does using implicit arguments instead of typeclasses have something to do with situations in which one has several sigma algebras on the same type? I think accommodating those situations is important. But I'd really like to hear how the change helps and when am I supposed to choose implicit measurable spaces instead of typeclasses. Thanks!</p>

<p>Provided the subtype of subtype is not going to be an issue, this looks good to me.</p>

<p>I remembered one more thing that keeps bothering me slightly. I don't think I have managed to convince anyone else about it (yet), though... <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span> The issue is that I believe the default topology instance on <code>probability_measure</code> indeed deserves to be that of weak convergence of measures (convergence in distribution) but I believe that in the long term the most meaningful topology instance on <code>finite_measure</code> might be coming from the total variation distance (so that finite measures are essentially the dual, not weak dual, of bounded continuous functions, reasonably interpreted). In this case we would <em>not</em> want to use the subtype topology.</p>

<p>In my area of maths, the most meaningful topology on finite measures is the weak convergence of measures. Typical use case: a sequence of probability measures that converges to a measure of mass <code>&lt; 1</code>, because some mass is escaping at infinity. You need to be in the realm of finite measures to talk about this, because the limiting measure is not a probability measure any more.</p>

<p>Concerning the different topologies: a typical solution is to use type aliases to distinguish between them. Would that suffice here?</p>

<p>If you want to talk about weak convergence without adding <code>to_weak</code>/<code>from_weak</code> all the time, it may be useful to also add something like <code>def weak_nhds μ := map from_weak (nhds (to_weak μ))</code>.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="373986">@Kalle Kytölä</span> you don't really need to review that PR anymore. I agree with the comment of Eric on the PR, which is that if what we want is to have a coercion, we might as well simply add a <code>has_coe</code> def instead of changing everything. Thus the changes in the PR are mostly not relevant anymore. This of course does not answer the question of whether we want that coe. To me, seeing your <code>test_against_nn</code> in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/9430">#9430</a>, it felt like we wanted to have it, but that was only one quick impression and I did not follow previous discussions about it.</p>
<p>Regarding the <code>{m : measurable_space E}</code> vs <code>[measurable_space E]</code> arguments: the typeclass argument is perfect for situations in which there is only one sigma-algebra around (which is most of the measure_theory files). However when using several sigma-algebras, the one inferred might not be the one on which some measure is defined and you might want to use your lemma for that measure (and it will not work). A simple solution is to use an implicit argument whenever the measurable space can be deduced from another argument of the lemma (like a measure).</p>

<p>On the subject of having coe to both <code>finite_measure</code> and <code>measure</code>: I have no idea of whether this can cause problems or not. We could continue without the coe for a while and see if we get tired of writing <code>to_finite_measure</code> at some point or if it's not really an issue at all.</p>

<p>Sébastien's rationale for weak convergence as the default on <code>finite_measure</code> sounds quite good indeed.  Thank you! (And with that, the subtype topology looks like a decent option again.) Maybe a type synonym <code>finite_measure_tv</code> or something like that could hold the total variation metric eventually then.</p>

<p>Thank you <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="350992">@Rémy Degenne</span> for the answers!</p>
<p>I also had no clear idea about the problems that could result from multiple <code>coe</code> routes, but as a design principle avoiding them sounded wise originally. (Although now exactly because I don't understand the downstream problems concretely enough, I am slightly tempted to just deliberately give it a try to find out about them <span aria-label="grimacing" class="emoji emoji-1f62c" role="img" title="grimacing">:grimacing:</span>, especially if Rémy or someone else is also willing to go down that route <span aria-label="big smile" class="emoji emoji-1f604" role="img" title="big smile">:big_smile:</span>.) Anyways, I just want this one to be a deliberate choice.</p>
<p>But the PR obviously contained improvements (like <code>measure.to_probability_measure</code>, and I also believe you about the implicit argument for the measurable space), which should go ahead irrespectively of the subtype of subtype and coe route choices.</p>

<p>If you have multiple routes, then (a) you should try to make them definitionally equal; (b) you should prefer one way to another, add a direct <code>has_coe</code> for this route, and simplify other routes to this with <code>@[simp, norm_cast]</code> lemmas like <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/continuous_linear_map.coe_coe">docs#continuous_linear_map.coe_coe</a>. If you don't want to have surprises like unwanted transitive coercions, then you can use <code>has_coe_t</code> instead of <code>has_coe</code> for your coercions.</p>
