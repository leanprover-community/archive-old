<p><a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/6497">#6497</a>, which proves Weierstrass' theorem that you can uniformly approximate continuous functions on [0,1] by polynomials (by explicitly showing the Bernstein approximations converge) is perhaps ready to merge. I think a few people have looked at it, and I've just merged master and fixed bitrot.</p>
<p>I'm happy to split off any of the changes to subsidiary files if that would be helpful.</p>
<p>I have two more largish PRs (presumably plus smaller ones for distant files) that give us Weierstrass' theorem stated "more abstractly", and for other intervals, and that give us the Stone-Weierstrass theorem in general. But these have been sitting on the backburner while <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/6497">#6497</a> is being reviewed.</p>
