<p>Does anyone have time to have a look at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/13885">#13885</a> ? I've had some comments already on this, but it still needs to be looked at by someone who can approve the PR. Its the first part of the larger PR <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/13500">#13500</a> which has this uniform limit of holomorphic functions stuff.</p>

<p>I'll take a look now. It's possible I won't be able to make a call but let's see how I do.</p>

<p>(I got distracted but just did a quick review, I will aim to respond to your feedback without too much delay since you've been waiting some time already)</p>

<p>I just had another quick look at this PR and added another remark. I've marked it as "awaiting-author" for now but I'll pick it up again once the points I've raised have been addressed.</p>

<p>Thank you, I'm just looking at them now!</p>

<p>OK I've done pretty much all of the first round of changes. The only thing I've not done is remove <code>r</code> from <code>circle_integral_transform_deriv_bound</code>. It seems annoying to do and I'm not sure if the gains are worth it? But maybe I'm being silly and there is a quick way to do this.</p>

<p>I'll take a look again later today. IIRC the point about dropping <code>r</code> was that the simpler statement (without <code>r</code>) implied the more complicated one trivially so I'll probably just repeat my suggestion there.</p>
<p>However as I say, I'll look again later today.</p>

<p>I'm afraid I only got to look at this PR rather late in the day. I still think you should drop the <code>r</code> argument. I've just opened a very small PR to help:<br>
<code>(+10, -0)</code> <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14627">#14627</a> <em>feat(topology/metric_space/basic): add lemma exists_lt_mem_ball_of_mem_ball</em><br>
which I'd love to see resolved quickly so as not to block you.</p>

<p>I'll hope to have time to look in more detail this evening.</p>

<p>Oh awesome thanks! I'll have a go at removing 'r' later today or tomorrow.</p>

<p>Ok I think all of the changes have been made, so if anyone can have a look that would be great, thanks!</p>
