<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="243562">@Adam Topaz</span>  The <code>mono</code> assumption there ensures that pullback behaves like an intersection. <br>
This allows me to deduce <code>D.t i j ≫ D.t j i = 𝟙 _</code> and <code> D.t' i j k ≫ (pullback_symmetry _ _).hom ≫
   D.t' j i k ≫ (pullback_symmetry _ _).hom = 𝟙 _</code> from the arguments given. Replacing the <code>mono</code> assumption with these two equations probably will work as well, but I don't think this is worth it.</p>
<p>Actually, I don't really think this glue data stuff would be used except for gluing sheaves / schemes this way. For other descent constructions afterwards, we will be working with a covering family, and we would know where our structures are descending to. I think this would need another interface, and I do not have any sensible way at mind to unify these constructions.</p>
