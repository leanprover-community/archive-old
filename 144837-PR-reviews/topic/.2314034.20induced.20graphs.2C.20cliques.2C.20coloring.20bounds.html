<p>If someone could take a look at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14034">#14034</a>, it would be helpful, since I'm trying to make another push toward getting more basic graph theory in.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="246273">@Bhavik Mehta</span> had approved an earlier version of it, but I added the more general <code>simple_graph.map</code> and <code>simple_graph.comap</code> for pushing forward and pulling back graph structures along functions.</p>

<p>(wrong number in the topic)</p>

<p>I would be more comfortable with a smaller PR that defines <code>map</code> and <code>comap</code> for <code>simple_graph</code> and <code>subgraph</code>, but otherwise I'm quite happy with it.</p>

<p>Yeah, I admittedly am breaking PR best practices with this one</p>

<p>It seems the combinatorialist maintainers are away, so this is just a ping in case anyone happens to have some time to take a look.</p>
