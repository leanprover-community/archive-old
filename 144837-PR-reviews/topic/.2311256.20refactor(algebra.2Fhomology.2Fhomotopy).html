<p>While working on the Dold-Kan correspondence, I have struggled using the current way of defining chain homotopy of complexes. In PR <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/11256">#11256</a> I suggest an approach which could be more convenient.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Homotopies between morphisms <code>C ⟶ D</code> of homological_complex V c were based on families of morphisms <code>(hom : Π i j, C.X i ⟶ D.X j)</code> with the condition that <code>hom i j</code> = 0 when <code>¬c.rel j i</code> (e.g. <code>j≠i+1</code> in the case<br>
of chain_complexes). It was quite unpractical when one had to construct such homotopies because any definition would unnecessarily use a syntax like <code>if c.rel j i then ... else 0</code>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another way of solving this is to define a new constructor along the lines of:</p>

<p>I did not consider this exactly, but I believe this may require duplicating most of the simp lemmas into two versions, as we recently discussed about null_homotopic_map/null_homotopic_map' in PR <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/11125">#11125</a>. In this PR, I have also added compatibilities with composition like prehomotopy_comp and comp_prehomotopy.</p>

<p>The downside with the new version is that you need to provide the witness <code>w : c.rel j i</code> all the time. When proving API lemmas, this is usually easy, as it is one of the assumptions.</p>

<p>But if you are applying it to <code>j = 3</code> and <code>i = 2</code>, then you need to give a proof of <code>3 = 2+1</code> in the middle of using your homotopy.</p>

<p>I do not agree that we have to provide the witness all the time when using this new (pre)homotopies. There is only a small syntactic tweak that has to be done when one constructs a prehomotopy (adding convenience constructors [in the other direction than the one you suggest] may even facilitate the transition). Then, when doing computations, we have to unfold or simplify a "d_next i hom + prev_d i hom", and in order to understand what it looks like, you need to know what <a href="http://c.next">c.next</a> i and c.prev i are! which is the purpose the simplifications lemmas I have added. Anyway, I believe that the previous API did not use at all the value of the morphisms C.i ⟶ D.j when c.rel j i was not true... <br>
In other terms, I do not think that there is any mathematical reason to evaluate an homotopy to get a (zero) map C_n ⟶ D_{n+2}!</p>

<p>When I thought about these issues a while ago I wrote a bunch of code using Joel's suggestion (throwing in proofs that j=i+1 when needed) and I thought it was fine -- it worked for me, at least. Then the idea of these "lawless complexes" came up (where you have maps A_i -&gt; A_j for all i and j and they're just zero in the case where a mathematician would imagine they're not well-defined) but since then I didn't ever do any serious work in the area so don't feel in a position to comment. The "throw in a proof that j=i+1" seemed to solve all the problems I was having though (the issue being that A_{i+1-1} was not defeq to A_i)</p>

<p>Ah, indeed, a more major refactor would be to do the change I suggest also for the definition of the homological_complex so that the differential C_i -&gt; C_j makes sense only in the relevant mathematical case where c.rel i j. That would be a Revolution! I am only suggesting doing so for homotopies :-)</p>
<p>The idea of doing so came when I wanted to check the naturality of my constructions on normalized Moore complexes/alternating face map complexes, that is certain null homotopic maps verify a certain naturality property. With the current API, I had to check it was natural even in the nonsensical cases (where I had to separataly prove that 0 composed with something equals 0, etc). With my API, I only have to deal with sensical cases.</p>

<p>In my understanding, in the matter of <code>d i</code> vs <code>d i j</code>, it seems the best decision was made to use two variables i j, otherwise there are issues at the extremities of the complexes. The penance for that is that when we want to construct a complex (or an homotopy), we cannot just provide differentials X_{n+1} -&gt; X_n (or in the other way), but we have to define X_i -&gt; X_j (or X_j -&gt; X_i) whenever i=j+1, which means we usually have to do a variation on eq_to_hom. That is one matter, but there is no alternative, and chain_complex.of_hom does the job :-)</p>
<p>After browsing through the discussion, it seems to me that my suggestion is pushing slightly further in the same direction as your PR <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/7666">#7666</a> <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/7673">#7673</a>, which is: focusing on mathematically relevant definitions and axioms.</p>

<p>The issue with <code>d i : A i \to A (i + 1)</code> is a subtle one relating to dependent type theory. Basically the problem is that <code>d (i - 1)</code> does not go from <code>A (i - 1)</code> to <code>A i</code> but from <code>A (i - 1)</code> to <code>A ((i - 1) + 1)</code>, and it can be hard sometimes to move between <code>A ((i - 1) + 1)</code> and <code>A i</code> for reasons which I have never fully understood.</p>

<p>Here, I have used <code>K.d Δ.len Δ'.len</code>, so that it may appear that if the differential <code>K.d</code> was defined only on things like <code>⟨(i,j),hij⟩</code> I would have to provide a proof hij that <code>j=i+1</code>, which could be annoying. Actually, providing such a proof would be very easy because this is precisely the left part of my assumption <code>is_d0 i</code>! The only difference is that I cannot use <code>ite</code>, but only the <code>dite</code> embedded in the <code>by_cases</code> tactic.<br>
Whether it is for differentials or homotopies, we only use them in degrees where they are meaningful, so that the proof <code>hij</code> should always be around.</p>
<p>I will take me some time to finish the Dold-Kan equivalence, and the effort to change that code from one homotopy API to another would not be very difficult anyway, so that there is no hurry here. When I finish, maybe I could try to compile the LTE and see whether it completely breaks or not...</p>

<p>Ah, indeed, a more major refactor would be to do the change I suggest also for the definition of the homological_complex so that the differential C_i -&gt; C_j makes sense only in the relevant mathematical case where c.rel i j. That would be a Revolution! I am only suggesting doing so for homotopies :-)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just a remark: some people want diagrams indexed by categories, and some other prefer them being indexed by quivers.  I'm rather of the second kind, but if one thinks at higher levels, the first point of view is certainly the more natural. And then a complex C would have maps C_i \to C_j for all j \geq i — which, of course, are 0 if j \geq i+2.</p>
