<p>Dear All,</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14153">#14153</a> is ready for review!  Most of the code has been written by Gabriel: my main claim of originality in this PR is denoting by <code>pat</code> an argument to a function.</p>
<p>My initial version was much fuzzier in its matching: it applied more generally, but was more buggy as well.</p>
<p>I am trying to get the fuzzier version working (<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14532">#14532</a>), implementing a version of <a href="#narrow/stream/239415-metaprogramming-.2F-tactics/topic/variant.20syntax.20for.20.60congr'.60/near/282360799">this request</a> of Heather's.  As you can see from the tests, <code>congrm_1</code> works, but is not really ready.</p>
<p>Since the non-fuzzy <code>congrm</code> seems to me like a very good addition, though, I welcome any comments on PR <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14153">#14153</a> (as well as the rougher <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14532">#14532</a>)!</p>
