<p>Thanks to Heather Macbeth's and Eric Wieser's help, this is essentially reduced to copy and paste from <code>bilinear_form</code>.</p>

<p>Instead of doing a copy-paste, would it make more sense to modify <code>bilin_form</code> in-place to permit sesquilinearity? (In the same way that <code>linear_map</code> is really semilinear)</p>

<p>Also, I think it would make sense to make things semilinear in both arguments wherever possible.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="310045">@Eric Wieser</span> this is what will happen in the end, but the amount of code to refactor is quite large and this would be any PR extremely large</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="311453">@Frédéric Dupuis</span> in some cases we need the ring homomorphism to be an isomorphism and in these cases the inference for the linear case does not really work and we end up with stuff like this: <code>@span_singleton_inf_orthogonal_eq_bot _ _ _ _ _ (ring_equiv.refl K) B x hx</code>, which I find rather unsatisfying. There would be way more instances of this if we make both arguments semilinear. If we figure out a way to avoid this, I am happy to change to fully semibilinear maps.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="412682">@Moritz</span> One way to ensure that the ring hom is actually an isomorphism is to require the presence of a second ring hom that is the inverse of the first one. In fact, this is how we define linear equivalences: if you look at the definition of <code>M ≃ₛₗ[σ] M₂</code> in <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/linear_equiv">docs#linear_equiv</a>, we have a second ring hom <code>σ'</code> as an implicit parameter, and the typeclass arguments <code>[ring_hom_inv_pair σ σ'] [ring_hom_inv_pair σ' σ]</code> which state that those two ring homs are inverses of each other.</p>

<p>thanks a lot, that makes it way better. I have the issue though that for <code>[comm_ring R] [is_domain R]</code> it fails to simplify <code>J x = 0</code> to <code>x = 0</code>. For fields it works fine.</p>

<p>If this comes up a few times, you can always add that as a lemma.</p>

<p>actually for fields I do not need the <code>ring_hom_inv_pair</code> at all. Currently there is only one lemma (<code>ortho_smul_right</code>) that is defined for <code>[comm_ring R] [is_domain R]</code> and needs <code>ring_hom_inv_pair</code>.</p>

<p>I changed everything (except for symmetric bilinear forms) to being semibilinear in both arguments, also I changed <code>ortho_smul_right</code> (and <code>ortho_smul_left</code>) to be defined for fields and added a note that it also holds for <code>[comm_ring R] [is_domain R]</code> if the ring homomorphism is invertible.</p>

<p>I totally forgot about this PR. If you want I can do the refactoring in-place, but the issue is that that will be quite a large refactor and if there are improvements it will be more work to rewrite large amounts of code. This is why I was proposing to do this in small portions by generalizing from <code>bilinear_form</code> to <code>sesquilinear_form</code>.</p>
