<p>I have started a refactor of Bochner integral, so that <code>âˆ« x in a..b, f</code> makes sense when, say, <code>f</code> is continuous on <code>[a, b]</code> but possibly not globally measurable. The idea is to define the integral for all functions that coincide almost everywhere with a measurable function (i.e., which are measurable for the completed measure). It is a little bit painful, but I think it is definitely worth it. It is not building yet, but I'm already sharing it since I won't have time to work on it in the next few days -- maybe <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="214703">@Yury G. Kudryashov</span> or <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="111080">@Floris van Doorn</span> will want to have a look and share some thoughts!</p>

<p>This is indeed worth it! This had to be done at some point, so it's great that you started on this.</p>
