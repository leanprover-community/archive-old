<p>This is set family combinatorics. It defines the slice of a set family and a stupid predicate for saying that all finsets in a set have size <code>r</code>.</p>
<p>MIght anybody review it? It's been rotting in the queue for a while (my fault for giving it imaginary dependencies...)</p>

<p>In a totally unrelated way, this also turns out to be useful for simplicial complexes. <code>sized</code> is more or less the condition for a simplicial complex to be pure.</p>
