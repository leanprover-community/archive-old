<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="246273">@Bhavik Mehta</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span>, has the fate of the earlier sheaves-on-spaces code been decided? Are we going to attempt to discard it all, and solely use the new sheaves-on-sites code? Or build bridges and keep both?</p>
<p>(I hope the first option is viable!)</p>

<p>I think both options are viable, and there hasn't really been much discussion on this - I thought we were going to build bridges and keep both, but I have no objection to try discarding the spaces code.</p>
