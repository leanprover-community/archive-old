<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> I just wanted to ask: did you ask me to take out the bundled formalism from this PR so that some mantainer other than Sébastien can approve it or will it still need to be reviewed by Sébastien? In the latter case I might wait for his answer so that if we can sort out the discussion about bundled sections before maybe he will ok with things as they are now!</p>

<p>I certainly think Sébastien should have another look.</p>

<p>I am still very convinced by the unbundled stuff, and less convinced by the bundled one, so I think it makes sense to split the PR: shorter PRs are always faster to get merged, and the unbundled part should be easy to review.</p>

<p>Btw <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8103">#8103</a> and <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8295">#8295</a> should also be ready at this point</p>

<p>I am not sure about what the current plan is: when you <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110050">@Sebastien Gouezel</span> said to merge master and fix the build, were you referring to me or to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="260507">@Heather Macbeth</span> ? I'd be happy to do it but it looks that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="260507">@Heather Macbeth</span>  took over <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8545">#8545</a> and this PR</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="267205">@Nicolò Cavalleri</span> In both cases I got started the process of merging/adapting to the new definition, but there is more work to be done.</p>
<ul>
<li>in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8545">#8545</a> the stricter new definition requires one new proof, which I have sorried,</li>
<li>in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/7803">#7803</a> there are weird bugs created by the merge from mismatched variable scope and sectioning, which it will be easier for you to figure out than me.</li>
</ul>
