<p>Dear maintainers, <br>
can someone have a look at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/6910">#6910</a>? It has been open, without comments, since almost a week and as far as I can see it should be quite easy. In practice I generalize isometries to  <code>pseudo_metric_space</code> and everything works  well.</p>
<p>Of course I don't want to put any pressure on anybody, and thank you very much for your amazing job!</p>
