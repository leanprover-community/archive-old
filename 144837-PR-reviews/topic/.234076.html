<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span>, there is a question on <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/4076">#4076</a> about when we're supposed to be using <code>normal</code> as an explicit argument, and when as an instance implicit argument. I think it's fine if it is not uniform, but <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110596">@Rob Lewis</span> is right to suggest there should be some comment explaining when to use each. I think you did the refactor that made <code>normal</code> a class --- could you suggest approximately what I should say here?</p>

<p>I'll take a look later today. In the group theory game we develop all of group theory from scratch starting from the definition and going up to sylow 1. In this development we bundled normal, like bundling subgroup. Worked fine.</p>

<p>So <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span>  I have no memory of doing a refactor which made <code>normal</code> a class, and as far as I can see this is an implementation issue, something I'm extremely bad at. I am kind of leaning towards the idea that <code>normal</code> should be a bundled structure. This isn't much help for your PR I know, but the truth is that I cannot believe I have any kind of understanding of the situation which you and Rob don't understand 10 times better.</p>

<p>No worries, I'll take a look!</p>
