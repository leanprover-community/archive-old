<p>Currently algebra/group/with_one.lean has <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/40214fcbc84e71868429c5e7cc8b70548773efb8/src/algebra/group/with_one.lean#L59">mul_coe</a> as a <code>simp</code> lemma, whereas I think it should be the other way and a <code>norm_cast</code> lemma. </p>
<p>I wanted to prove that if G was a <code>comm_group</code> then <code>with_zero G</code> was a <code>comm_group_with_zero</code>, something which doesn't seem to be in mathlib. I've got it working but because I changed the <code>mul_coe</code> to the way around I thought it should be going in the process, it's broken a bunch of proofs (including some proofs in ennreal stuff which had non-terminal simps in). I've finally found the time to fix everything up; but am I going the wrong way here? Ultimately I just need the comm_group_with_zero from a group, for valuation theory. mathlib is compiling on the branch but it's bedtime and it wouldn't surprise me if the linter fails.</p>

<p>I agree that it should go the other way.</p>
