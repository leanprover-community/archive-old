<p><a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/leanprover-community.github.io/pull/196">#196</a> is an update to the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/extras/simp.html">simplification documentation</a>.</p>

<p>I'm not really sure what the lifecycle of a PR is for the website -- so I figured I'd mention that this PR exists here.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I found editing this documentation to have a high barrier to entry (there's a <code>docs/extras/simp.md</code> in mathlib, but it's a redirect, so then I had to find the right repo, and after editing it I found I didn't have permission to push a branch, so I had to fork the website and make a PR using my fork's branch).  There must be a reason it's not, but it would be nice if all mathlib documentation were in the mathlib repo.</p>

<p>It looks good to me, but I've been hoping an expert like <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> might take a quick look at it.</p>

<p>I tried digging up what the <code>lift_eq</code> and <code>use_axioms</code> configuration options do, reading through the core C++ code as best I could.</p>
<p><code>lift_eq</code> seems to have something to do with generating proofs of reflexive relations from proofs of equalities, though I couldn't come up with an example.</p>
<p><code>use_axioms</code> seems to allow <code>simp</code> to use <code>funext</code> and <code>propext</code> (for example, to rewrite under binders).</p>
<p>I also wrote that <code>canonize_proofs</code> lets <code>simp</code> replace proofs with a canonical defeq one, since that's what the source code said. I have no idea when or why you'd do this. Maybe this is from the before-times when proof irrelevance wasn't a thing.</p>

<p>simp uses <code>propext</code> when simp lemmas are provided in the form <code>A &lt;-&gt; B</code>, because internally it only knows how to handle equality rewriting</p>

<p>No, this is not before time stuff. Proofs are defeq but not syntactically equal, and simp cares about syntactic equality, so it does make a difference. Note that there are quire a few simp lemmas that use variables in place of proof arguments on the LHS for added generality even when the argument can be given a proof</p>

<p>I don't have any additional wisdom regarding <code>lift_eq</code>, unfortunately. I suspect it might have something to do with generalizing <code>congr</code> and <code>simp</code> to work on other relations, which never really happened</p>

<p>I'd gotten as far as finding that there was <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/blob/master/src/library/defeq_canonizer.h#L33">a map for that</a> (it's also used for instances), but I didn't dig into what was responsible for maintaining it.</p>
<p>I had no idea that <code>simp</code> didn't know about proof irrelevance; that's interesting. I'm now wondering if I've introduced any simp lemmas that weren't proof-generic enough...</p>

<p>Are you talking about the "congruence lemmas" mentioned in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/blob/master/src/library/tactic/simplify.cpp">simplify.cpp</a>, or is <code>congr</code> used somewhere in <code>simp</code>?</p>

<p>That's correct. It would be nice to figure out <code>lift_eq</code> and get rid of the (?), but I don't have the time to investigate this myself, and the changes themselves look good</p>

<p>It'd also be nice to have some explanation of what the role of congruence lemmas is with <code>simp</code>, but <code>simp.md</code> is already trying to do too much.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://documentation.divio.com/">theory of documentation</a> that there are broadly four types, and that it's useful to be clear what you're targeting.  <code>simp.md</code> is mostly an explanation (for theoretical knowledge while studying), but by the end it becomes a reference (for theoretical knowledge while working).  Ideally the reference part would be a separate document that's integrated into <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#simp">tactic#simp</a> (with <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#simp">tactic#simp</a> being the first part of a longer reference document, like the beginning of a <a href="https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Dt.html">Mathematica reference page</a>).  It's better having this information written down than not having it at all, but adding too much else to <code>simp.md</code> seems to be out of scope for what it aims to be.</p>
<p>Long term I'd like to reorganize the documentation to make it easy to have all these kinds of articles, all interlinked, but it's not something I can put any time into for at least another couple of months.</p>

<p>Looks like the markdown processor for the website doesn't italicize <code>*`simp` lemmas*</code> like "<em><code>simp</code> lemmas</em>".  (And Zulip-flavored markdown has no escaping, so I can't reproduce what it looks like here.)</p>
<p>It seems that the <code>code { padding: 1px 3px }</code> causes the first line of every code block to be indented by 3 pixels in my browsers (Chrome and Firefox on linux).</p>
