<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span>  I have a pretty high-level comment about the design of the subobject/limits API and I am interested in your (and also everyone else's) thoughts on this.</p>
<p>From my naive perspective, there are two possible ways to approach special subobjects:</p>
<ol>
<li>make them <code>abbreviation</code>s and try to reuse as much of the generic subobject API as possible;</li>
<li>make them <code>def</code>s and build their own little API.</li>
</ol>
<p>Option 1 is used a lot in the limits API (I'm thinking of making things like <code>is_equalizer</code> and <code>equalizer</code> abbreviations for <code>is_limit</code> and <code>limit</code>). In theory, this should be very efficient, because you can just use all of the <code>is_limit</code>/<code>limit</code> lemmas when working with equalizers and avoid specializing the API to all of the shapes. When I first learned the limits API, I thought this was a great idea, but when Kevin tried to use the special shapes API, we realised that working with them is actually really hard unless you sit down and thoroughly comprehend all 1000+ lines of (what was then called) <code>limits/limits.lean</code> and therefore knew that what you would expect to be called <code>equalizer.lift_ι</code> is actually called <code>limit.lift_π</code> (of course, <code>simp</code> knew all along, but there are many cases in which this does not really help). In the end, to flatten the learning curve of the special shapes API, we did specialize most of the API to the various shapes (for example in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/2396">#2396</a> and <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/2423">#2423</a>), hence eliminating much of the (perceived?) advantage of using <code>abbreviation</code>s in the first place (unless there is some other advantage that I'm missing).</p>
<p>By changing <code>equalizer_subobject</code> into an abbreviation while retaining the API around <code>equalizer_subobject_iso</code> (which continues to be a <code>def</code>), you seem to be proposing a sort of hybrid approach between the two options I mentioned above. I'm curious what your thought process behind this decision was.</p>
<p>Note: I believe that the question of <code>abbreviation</code> vs <code>def</code> is orthogonal to what I mentioned at <a href="#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/homology.20design.20question/near/234636164">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/homology.20design.20question/near/234636164</a>. What I was trying to say in that thread is that I believe that I hope that with a good generic subobject API it could be possible to work with the limits subobjects without having to deal with <code>underlying_iso</code> (or its descendants like <code>equalizer_subobject_iso</code>) in every statement/proof.</p>

<p>First an apology: the change to <code>abbreviation</code> in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7203">#7203</a> was not very well thought out. It apparently helps somewhere in the homology2 branch, but I never put in the effort to try removing it again, and so have probably made <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7203">#7203</a> prematurely. (I'm trying to slice off pieces of <code>homology2</code> so a PR becomes plausible....)</p>

<p>I think we should undo the change to <code>abbreviation</code>, and go with option 2. It's more effort now, of course, but hopefully easier to use later.</p>

<p>(Your account of using the special shapes API is spot on, I think.)</p>
