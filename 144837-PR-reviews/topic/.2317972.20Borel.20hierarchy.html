<p>I think I messed up with the PR process. I intended to <em>to make many PRs containing small, self-contained pieces</em>, so I committed+pushed some material and created this PR. Later I committed material intended for a 2nd PR (to be reviewed afterwards) but it got absorbed by this one.</p>
<p>Should I rebase my branch in order to eliminate that last commit?</p>
<p>Apart from some line overflows, I think it looks OK, but if I keep it, the commit message for the PR has half the information right now.</p>

<p>We don't care about the commit history within a PR because we squash-merge, so do whatever you prefer!</p>

<p>I understand that, when the review process has started. I'll just commit to satisfy the linters then.</p>
<p>EDIT: Well, I did that and edited the PR title &amp; comment in order to better reflect the current situation. I also explained that the changes to <code>set_theory</code> could be reviewed separately (that was my original intent).</p>

<p><em>On the new file <code>borel_hierarchy.lean</code></em>: Near the end, the main results in <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/measure_theory/card_measurable_space.html">measure_theory.card_measurable_space</a> are reproved. As part of the initial development, I removed the original (theorem) docstrings.<br>
I believe it would be reasonable to split the file, use the last part as a replacement of <code>measure_theory.card_measurable_space</code> while adding the missing theorem docstrings and the original authors to the list.</p>
