<p>Patrick suggested that <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/17009">#17009</a> (a PR adding a small script that tells you what you might work on to port stuff to mathlib4) be merged as is, but presumably didn't delegate himself as he wrote the original script.</p>
<p>Could someone take a look and hit merge?</p>
