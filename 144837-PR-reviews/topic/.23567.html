<p><a href="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/567" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/567">https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/567</a></p>
<p>This is my PR which includes a formalization of basic probability theory - including Bayes theorem. I intend to make this a foundation for defining random variables, properties of random variables and in particular, a normally distributed random variable.</p>
<p>I currently defined a <code>probability_measure</code> as extending the <code>measure_theory.measure</code>, which maps into <code>ennreal</code>. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110294">@Johannes HÃ¶lzl</span>  requested me to redefine this as mapping into <code>nnreal</code> or <code>real</code>. But if I do this, it is breaking a lot of proofs and I am unable to directly use the <code>measure_theory</code> library results already proven.  Maybe there is a clever way of redefining it which avoids these issues, but I am a beginner and am unable to figure it out. </p>
<p>I just wanted suggestions on how to proceed with this.</p>

<p>Update:  As per <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> 's suggestion,  I've included a <code>nnreal</code> variant for each lemma I've proven in the original file. Also included are two lemmas <code>has_sum_coe'</code> and <code>tsum_coe'</code> in <code>/topology/instances/ennreal.lean</code> which deal with a finite sum of <code>ennreal</code>s having a sum.</p>
