<p>I had this written originally without using any category theory language explicitly about preserving products (i.e. without using the language in <code>category_theory.limits.preserves</code>). The main issue with using the category theory language for <code>preserves_products</code> is first we would need to show <code>has_products Groupoid</code>. I added this feature in the latest commit, but I'm not sure it's a good idea to do it this way.</p>
<p>Specifically, first of all, it is not very general. We should show that Grpd has all limits. Moreover, I couldn't even find where it is proven that Cat has limits/has products, if it is in mathlib at all, so I had no real model to go off of.</p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most crucially, showing that <code>Groupoid</code> has products involves a lot of <code>functor.ext</code>, which according to the documentation is not good to use. Instead, we should be using some kind of natural transformation, but I'm not really sure how to write that.</p>
<p>Note that these modifications don't significantly depend on the other results in the PR, so it might be better to separate them out into a new branch. In any case, what is the best course of action regarding the language we use to saw that the fundamental groupoid functor preserves products:</p>
<p>- The current way, which just shows that <code>category_theory.Groupoid.of (Π i : I, (π.obj (X i)).α) ≅ (π.obj (Top.of (Π i, X i)))</code>, with the inverse functor being the product of the induced projection maps <br>
  - Implement <code>has_products Groupoid</code> for now the way it is implemented, and use it to say that <code>fundamental_groupoid_functor</code> preserves products using category theory language (but it might be refactored later)<br>
  - Implement <code>has_products Groupoid</code> in another (cleaner?) way</p>

<p>in which the second can be inferred from the other two. Since <code>has_product</code> is a Prop, the second instance is completely redundant.</p>

<p>It would definitely be nice to have constructions of (co)limits in <code>Cat</code> and <code>Groupoid</code>. I worked a bit on fibered categories, and needed to define the <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/compare/lax_grothendieck?expand=1#diff-b4862c15e3b9ba4a4e55f5b8f3aebe6e6f000c0606ad1c02d0368d68759e0401R30-R33">fiber category of the projection functor <code>p</code> over an object and the identity morphism</a> (also necessary to construct a pseudofunctor out of a fibration of categories, though I haven't got there), which is the pullback of the inclusion functor from <code>discrete punit</code> and <code>p</code> in <code>Cat</code>, but it isn't in mathlib afaik.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think you should not be afraid of using <code>functor.ext</code>, and my philosophy as demonstrated in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9972">#9972</a> is that we should strive to prove all equalities of functors that hold, and they can simplify things, though explicit isomorphisms (that are equal to <code>eq_to_hom</code>) may be easier to construct and sometimes preferred over <code>eq_to_hom</code>. Mathlib has extensive API about cones and limits that you can take advantage of, while the 2-limit API will need time to take shape. So I think it would be beneficial to simply work with the existing limits library for now.</p>

<p>I originally tried making it a notation, but ran into trouble when writing <code>π.obj</code> and <code>π.map</code>. As I understand it, an abbreviation means that writing <code>π</code> is exactly equivalent to writing <code>fundamental_groupoid_functor</code>, but it's shorter?</p>
<p>In any case, if we don't want to use <code>π</code>, we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make localized notation <code>π_obj</code>, <code>π_map</code> to refer to <code>π.obj</code> and <code>π.map</code>, in addition to <code>π</code> to refer to the functor itself</li>
<li>Define a global abbreviation<code>π₁</code> or <code>Pi₁</code> for the fundamental groupoid functor, and hope it doesn't conflict too much with other things.</li>
<li>Use the full name <code>fundamental_groupoid_functor</code> everywhere (although it's very long)</li>
<li>Define some other abbreviation -- maybe something that looks like <code>π₁</code>, but is less frequently used?</li>
</ul>

<p>If <code>notation `π` := fundamental_groupoid_functor</code>, then to get <code>fundamental_groupoid_functor.obj</code> you need to write <code>π .obj</code> with the space in the middle.</p>

<p>I added the notation <code>π</code> for the fundamental groupoid functor, and explicit notation <code>πₓ</code> and <code>πₘ</code> for <code>π.obj</code> and <code>π.map</code> respectively. The notation <code>π .obj</code> is really weird to me, especially since the space is necessary. Not sure if adding so much notation is considered bad form, since it makes it more likely to conflict with other things.</p>
