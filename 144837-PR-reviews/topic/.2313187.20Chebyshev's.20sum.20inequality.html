<p>After a month and a half of intense work, I can proudly say that Chebyshev's inequality is ready for review!</p>

<p>"monovary" has very few hits on google -- there's someone on Tumblr, there's the disease mono, and then there's the mathlib docs. Is it worth explaining what the word means?? I don't think it's a standard maths term, at least in UK English.</p>

<p><code>monovary f g</code> means <code>∀ i j, f i &lt; f j → g j ≤ g i</code>. How would you state that in words?</p>

<p>This is tough really, I mean in some sense I might make a word up, but then I'd have to explain what it meant in lots of places. "Weakly antitone" or something? I don't know :-/</p>

<p>If <code>f : ι → α</code>, <code>g : ι → β</code>, it means that one can order <code>ι</code> such that both <code>f</code> and <code>g</code> are monotone. The point is that</p>
<ul>
<li>actually one cannot order <code>ι</code> like so in full generality</li>
<li>this condition doesn't need an order on <code>ι</code> at all to be stated and proved</li>

<p>“Covariant” fits this description. I understand that name is taken for other purposes, but with Damiano's suggestion this could be turned into <em>covariant_with</em></p>

<p>covariant is usually used as a unary relation though. How about covariate?</p>

<p>I mostly really want Chebyshev's inequality to hit master because Szemerédi's regularity lemma depends on it.</p>
