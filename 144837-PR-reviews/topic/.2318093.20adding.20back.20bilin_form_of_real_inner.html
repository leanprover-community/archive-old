<p>I bumped a downstream project of mine, and found that this had disappeared. As far as I can tell it was removed without a suitable replacement, as the refactor  (removal of <code>bilin_form</code> entirely) that would replace it never concluded. Since it's a trivial bundling, I'd argue that it should remain in mathlib until we retry that refactor.</p>
