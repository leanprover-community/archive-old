<p>This PR is refactoring the limit API to work with arbitrary universes. I didn't dare to take on the refactor myself, but <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="439483">@Andrew Yang</span> proved that it is very doable!<br>
Still, I think this is a change that we should consider carefully, because we don't want to get bitten by it later on. (We've done several refactors of the universe levels for objects/morphisms, and those weren't always fun.)<br>
So I invite <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="243562">@Adam Topaz</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="246273">@Bhavik Mehta</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span> to look at this PR. Input from others is of course also very welcome.</p>

<p>Maybe preserves_limits should have the universe restriction, but preserves_limit and preserves_limits_of_shape could be generalized.</p>

<p>Thanks for the work! Great to see it's already completed.</p>
<p>Continuous functors are defined to be functors that preserves small limits, so I think the universe restriction on preserves_limits is reasonable. However I suspect that in most cases where a functor preserves_limits we should also be able to show it preserves_limits_of_size with arbitrary values of the two universe variables. This is the case at least for functors with adjoints; counterexamples may exist but should be rare. (Of course there are functors that preserves finite limits but not all small limits, but I suspect set-theoretic constructions are needed to produce examples for different universe levels of the index category J.)</p>
<p>I noticed the universe restriction on preserves_colimit when working on colimits in categories produced by the Grothendieck construction. (BTW, the bundled module category people are working on and discussing is also an example, and I hope the API will be of broader use.) The hom-types of the base category and the fiber categories may belong to different universe, and the total category would have hom-types in the max of the universes, and we need to consider cocones indexed by the same category J in the base, fiber, and total categories; fortunately we can talk about these cocones and their colimits thanks to this PR (<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10243">#10243</a>). However when I try to state that functors between fiber categories preserves limits, Lean complains. It seems Lean is unable to automatically fixate the fiber hom-type universes to be equal to that of J; I'll try to fixate the universes manually to see if the error goes away. (It doesn't make much sense to allow different hom-type universe for fibers and base, since if they are different we can usually only expect colimits in the total category to exist for J in the minimum of the universes, so the total category doesn't has_limits even when the base and fibers has_limits. PresheafedSpace could be shown to has_colimits only because Top.presheaf is defined to require value category hom-types belong to the same universe as the topological space.) So I may not end up using your new PR, but still great to see it happen!</p>

<p>I made that PR when trying to show that monomorphsims of functors can be checked pointwise, which follows easily from existing material as well, but the universes does not match. I guess it is until now that people didn't really need to talk about limits of functors, where these issue mostly occur.<br>
I'll probably only generalize the unverses in the <code>functor_category</code> files though. I don't think I would go on and generalize all ocurrences of <code>preserves_limits</code> since most categories doesn't have arbitrary limits to begin with.</p>

I was thinking of using <code>category_theory/limits/constructions/epi_mono.lean</code>.<br>
