<p>I have been thinking about the homology refactor, basically how to import in mathlib3/4 some constructions done in the LTE. One of the constructions I introduced was that of "short complexes" in a category <code>C</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="sd">/-- A short complex in a category `C` with zero morphisms is the datum</span>
<span class="sd">of two composable morphisms `f : X₁ ⟶ X₂` and `g : X₂ ⟶ X₃` such that</span>
<span class="sd">`f ≫ g = 0`. -/</span>
<span class="kd">structure</span> <span class="n">short_complex</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">has_zero_morphisms</span> <span class="n">C</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">:=</span>
<span class="o">{</span><span class="n">X₁</span> <span class="n">X₂</span> <span class="n">X₃</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">C</span><span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">(</span><span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">X₁</span> <span class="bp">⟶</span> <span class="n">X₂</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">(</span><span class="n">g</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">X₂</span> <span class="bp">⟶</span> <span class="n">X₃</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">(</span><span class="n">zero</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="bp">≫</span> <span class="n">g</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>All the API for homology should be adapted using <code>S : short_complex C</code> as an input, and then, when we want to apply this to homological complexes, we only have to consider complexes of the form <code>K.X (prev i) ⟶ K.X i ⟶ K.X (next i)</code>.</p>
<p>Another innovation in the LTE was the <code>has_homology</code> structure. I introduced a more basic datum <code>homology_iso_datum</code>. Following both Adam's ideas and mine, I ended up defining a <code>left_homology_datum</code> for a short complex <code>S</code> :</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">structure</span> <span class="n">left_homology_data</span> <span class="o">:=</span>
<span class="o">(</span><span class="n">K</span> <span class="n">H</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">C</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">(</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">K</span> <span class="bp">⟶</span> <span class="n">S.X₂</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">(</span><span class="n">π</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">K</span> <span class="bp">⟶</span> <span class="n">H</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">(</span><span class="n">hi₀</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="bp">≫</span> <span class="n">S.g</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">(</span><span class="n">hi</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">is_limit</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">kernel_fork.of_ι</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="n">hi₀</span><span class="o">))</span>
<span class="o">(</span><span class="n">hπ₀</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">hi.lift</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">kernel_fork.of_ι</span> <span class="n">_</span> <span class="n">S.zero</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="bp">≫</span> <span class="n">π</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">(</span><span class="n">hπ</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">is_colimit</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">cokernel_cofork.of_π</span> <span class="n">π</span> <span class="n">hπ₀</span><span class="o">))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This basically consists of the datum of a kernel <code>K</code> of <code>S.X₂ ⟶ S.X₃</code> and a cokernel <code>H</code> of the induced map <code>S.X₁ ⟶ K</code>.</p>
<p>Dually, a <code>right_homology_datum</code> can be defined as a similar datum using a cokernel <code>Q</code> of <code>S.X₁ ⟶ S.X₂</code> and a kernel <code>H</code> of the induced map <code>Q ⟶ S.X₃</code>.</p>
<p>Then, in a similar spirit as the <code>homology_gadget</code> suggested by Adam at <a href="#narrow/stream/267928-condensed-mathematics/topic/homology.20refactor/near/290844887">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/267928-condensed-mathematics/topic/homology.20refactor/near/290844887</a> (this is similar to the <code>has_homology</code> that is in the LTE), I define an <code>homology_data</code> for <code>S</code> as :</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">structure</span> <span class="n">homology_data</span> <span class="o">:=</span>
<span class="o">(</span><span class="n">left</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">S.left_homology_data</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">(</span><span class="n">right</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">S.right_homology_data</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">(</span><span class="n">iso</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">left.H</span> <span class="bp">≅</span> <span class="n">right.H</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">(</span><span class="n">comm</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">left.π</span> <span class="bp">≫</span> <span class="n">iso.hom</span> <span class="bp">≫</span> <span class="n">right.ι</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="n">left.i</span> <span class="bp">≫</span> <span class="n">right.p</span><span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then, one may define <code>[has_homology S]</code> when there exists such an <code>homology data</code>, and define the homology of <code>S</code> as the <code>left.H</code> field of such a data. By construction, this notion of homology is self-dual. From that, one may define a good self-dual notion of (short) exact sequences, etc. Recently, I was able to get the snake lemma (in a slightly easier manner than in the LTE). I have developed these ideas in a (draft) branch<br>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/homology_refactor">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/homology_refactor</a></p>
<p>The relevant code is in <code>algebra/homology/short_complex/</code>. Apart from the proof that short complexes in abelian categories have homology data, most of this code is quite straightforward and very boring, and when I tried to use this <code>short_complex</code> API in order to redefine the homology of homological complexes, etc, the transition was quite easy, and many definitions became shorter. Besides the self-dual notions of homology and exactness we<br>
get, this allows to define exact sequences without assuming <code>[has_images C] [has_kernels C]</code>: for example, split short exact sequences in preadditive categories (with a zero object) are exact with my definition, but it does not make sense with the current definition in mathlib.</p>
<p>I would rather do this refactor before the actual port of <code>mathlib</code> to <code>mathlib4</code> is done, so that I guess the best would be to introduce this in <code>mathlib</code> first. Then, I would like to do this refactor (which would start with the introduction of tidied versions of some of the files in <code>algebra/homology/short_complex/</code>, as a sequence of small PRs, followed with a large PR when the notions of homology currently in mathlib are replaced by this API). Any comments?</p>

<p>It's great that you could simplify the snake lemma! I think that's a good test case.</p>
