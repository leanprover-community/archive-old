<p>Are there any efforts to build a proof producing solver in Lean for discharging goals involving arithmetic constraints?<br>
I started to work on some buffer manipulation code as part of some work to formalize crypto routines in Lean.  I find myself spending a fair bit of time writing arithmetic lemmas by hand, and it seems like I should start working on automation rather than keep pushing through those lemmas.</p>

<p>a fair warning: in lean 3 I've learned to avoid the linarith tactic because it makes proofs unreasonably slow. I'm not sure if linarith could run faster in lean 4 or not</p>

<p>The thing about <code>linarith</code> is that it loves the jobs you hate. It makes working with Lean more like the way an undergraduate mathematician would work on paper -- "obviously a+b+c&gt;0 because this follows from the assumptions which I'm carrying around in my head". So for mathematicians it's a really important and useful tactic.</p>

<p>It's super useful for computer scientists and programmers too (for array bound checks if nothing else).  I think it's essential that Lean 4 have a fast linear arithmetic tactic (which some heuristics for limited non-linear).</p>

<p>Linarith isn't inherently slow. On average I wouldn't expect it to slow down your proofs more than <code>simp</code>, although of course they scale differently -- simp scales with the number of imports, <code>linarith</code> scales with the numbers of inequalities in your context and the number of variables in those inequalities. There's a <code>linarith only</code> variant that's faster.</p>

<p>That said, I think there's more promise for an efficient implementation of the simplex algorithm in Lean 4, which will scale better than the current Fourier-Motzkin implementation</p>

<p>That's a monster proof that's slow, period. There are 40 linarith calls in it, many with fairly big contexts. It shouldn't be at all surprising that replacing them with <code>sorry</code> speeds up the proof.</p>

<p>In addition, a lot of them involve natural number inequalities that get lifted (again and again and again) to <code>int</code>. Half of <code>linarith</code>'s execution time is spent in <code>zify</code> preprocessing.</p>

<p>I expect the use case I have will just involve really small arithmetic problems.  So far, I'm just addressing it by building up a collection of <a href="https://github.com/joehendrix/lean-crypto/blob/main/lib/Crypto/Nat.lean">lemmas</a> and doing the proofs <a href="https://github.com/joehendrix/lean-crypto/blob/d88744cd24130d8c520d408371701fa5174c3f3e/lib/Crypto/Array.lean#L25-L32">manually</a>.</p>
<p>I think that approach may run into problems once I start specifying the actual crypto algorithms though.</p>
