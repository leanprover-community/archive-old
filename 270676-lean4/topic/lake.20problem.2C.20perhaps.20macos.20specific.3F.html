<p>I reported <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lake/issues/26">an issue</a> with lake not rebuilding after modifying <code>lean-toolchain</code>, but unfortunately it doesn't reproduce for <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="315577">@Mac</span>. I'm wondering if it could be an OS issue. Is there someone with a macos system who could test it out for us?</p>

<p>On any machine with <code>elan</code> you should be able to:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Bash"><pre><span></span><code>git clone https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4.git
<span class="nb">cd</span> mathlib4
git checkout 64f9c43eb9a75fb4c5989ac711623d06e9696e60

lake build  <span class="c1"># returns immediately</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The problem I'm seeing is that the final <code>lake build</code> returns immediately, whereas Mac is seeing the correct behaviour, that <code>lake</code> rebuilds the library.</p>

<p>Currently, I rebuild between versions by rebuilding whenever the hash of <code>lean</code> changes. I think the problem here is that the hash isn't changing on non-Windows systems</p>

<p>I though maybe I was just really unlucky and my short 64-bit hash was encountering clashes, but no. For me, the binaries for nightlies 2021-11-05, 2021-11-07,  and 2021-11-10  (i.e., those at <code>&lt;home&gt;/.elan/toolchains/&lt;toolchain&gt;/bin/lean</code>) all have the same SHA256 hash.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span> using the githash was and idea of mine, but for now I had just been hashing the binary. Once reason I did this is because it changes to docs and the like  would not invoke unnecessary rebuilds. Would hashing  <code>lean</code> + <code>libleanshared</code> be sufficient? Or do I need to / should I use the githash?</p>
