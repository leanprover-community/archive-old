<p>Hello! <span aria-label="wave" class="emoji emoji-1f44b" role="img" title="wave">:wave:</span> <br>
What are the motivations for using forward declarations like <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/d03f0b38517d9ca28a5adc8d2c269f8c0f266d30/src/Lean/Meta/Basic.lean#L302">these</a>? Why not just state the <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/d03f0b38517d9ca28a5adc8d2c269f8c0f266d30/src/Lean/Meta/WHNF.lean#L807">implementation</a> right away?</p>

<p>Most likely it is bootstrapping concerns, or avoiding import cycles. <code>whnf</code> can be used immediately in <code>Lean.Meta.Basic</code> where it is defined without importing all the extra stuff that <code>Lean.Meta.WHNF</code> (where it is implemented) relies on.</p>

<p>Additional remarks: </p>
<ul>
<li>When we implemented this code, we were using the Lean 3 frontend, and the support for mutual recursion was very primitive</li>
<li>We have it today, but it would force us to put <code>inferType</code>, <code>whnf</code>, and <code>isDefEq</code> in the same <code>mutual</code> block. This would be a very big mutual block, and it would dramatically hurt the compilation times.</li>
</ul>

<p>That being said, we want to have proper forward declaration support in Lean 4 in the future. The current workaround is very hackish.</p>

<p>Why do mutual types hurt compilations times so much? Is it because they are had to check?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In this particular case, it would force us to put a lot of code in a single file <code>src/Lean/Meta/Basic.lean</code>, and many other files depend on it. The file <code>src/Lean/Meta/ExprDefEq.lean</code> is one of the most expensive files to compile. Right now, very few files depend on it because we used the forward declaration hack. This makes my life way more convenient. When I change this file, I don't have to recompile a ton of other files. Without the forward declaration hack, all this code would have to be at <code>src/Lean/Meta/Basic.lean</code>. <br>
Mutual definitions have the other minor and more general performance problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are treated as a single command. Any modification will force the server to recompile the whole block from scratch. </li>
<li>If we are not using <code>partial</code>, then we also have the overhead of combining all definitions into a single declaration. If we have hundreds of functions, we will need a big sum type there.</li>
</ul>
