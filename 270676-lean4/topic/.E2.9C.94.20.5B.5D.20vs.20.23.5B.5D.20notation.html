<p>This is a possibility, but we would need to use the expected type, which is not always available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the detailed explanation! I had a suspicion that there was a deeper reason and that this is not a can of worms to be opened now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fwiw, I like the distinction. Lists and arrays have very different uses and performance characteristics and this makes it immediately clear which one is being used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't disagree and don't have strong opinion either way.</p>
<p>I tend to see the performance characteristics coming into play when creating the data type and not when using it. A consumer of a library usually assumes that the producer of the library made the right data type choice and just wants to use it.</p>
<p>But my question was mostly a curiosity about the distinction.</p>

<p>FYI you can use <code>{}</code> or <code>∅</code> for both arrays and lists, via the <code>EmptyCollection</code> class (but only for empty structures).</p>
