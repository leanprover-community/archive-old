<p>Hi!<br>
Looking at the <code>lake script</code> API, I feel like <code>lake script run foo</code> is rather long/verbose. So I thought of having <code>lake script foo</code> again (like we had before) and <code>lake scripts</code> as the call to list available scripts and their docstrings in a single command.</p>
<p>I also think that having all scripts in the <code>lakefile.lean</code> file can become a bit crowded, so my other idea is being able to implement scripts in their own files, which can be located in a customizable folder (default = <code>scripts</code>). Or, heck, being able to link to scripts from other repositories would be cool too :D</p>
<p>What do you guys think?</p>

<p>What is the reason for not having <code>lake run foo</code>? It is the shortest and most clear. I'm constantly getting the order of <code>script</code> and <code>run</code> incorrectly.</p>

<p><code>lake script</code> has other options like <code>doc foo</code> and <code>list</code> iirc. But both of those can be tackled by a <code>lake scripts</code> at the same time. I don't think it's worth making the command to run scripts longer because of secondary options, especially because they are not used very often (I never used them)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="451983">@Arthur Paulino</span>  Feel free to post an issue with the request on the Lake repo. That way you can know when  I have completed it. :)</p>

<p>I left the scripts folder out because there might be some unnecessary complications when dealing with scripts that have repeated names</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="451983">@Arthur Paulino</span> That issue made me realize that your suggestion was actually slightly different than <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="346070">@Tomas Skrivan</span>'s (sorry for my mistaken quick skim). Primarily this part:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Resurrect the old <code>lake script foo</code> as the command to run the script <code>foo</code></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The old command was <code>lake run foo</code>, which I would be happy to resurrect as an abbreviation for <code>lake script run</code>. I would also be willing to add a <code>lake scripts</code> as an abbreviation for <code>lake script list</code>. However, I do want to keep more granular <code>lake script &lt;subcommand&gt;</code> around as an option. </p>
<p>How does that sound?</p>

<p>That's even better since <code>run</code> is shorter than <code>script</code></p>
