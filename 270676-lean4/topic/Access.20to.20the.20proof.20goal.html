<p>Hi! I'm new here, so I'm sorry if this question is misplaced.<br>
I have an idea of a project here for which having access to the current proof goal or,  more in general, to (what I think people call) the _context_ (eg. that which is shown on infoview on vscode)  in a structured manner would be useful. <br>
That is, I'd like to be able to extract the updated context for each line of a program for further processing. Would that, or something similar to that, be currently feasible (without  having to open vscode, that is)? If so, I'd be very grateful for some pointers :)</p>

<p>Is that leanInk?</p>

<p>Indeed you can take inspiration from the code at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/LeanInk">https://github.com/leanprover/LeanInk</a>. Entry points include <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/LeanInk/blob/main/LeanInk/Analysis/Analysis.lean">https://github.com/leanprover/LeanInk/blob/main/LeanInk/Analysis/Analysis.lean</a> which runs the Lean frontend on a given Lean file and <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/LeanInk/blob/main/LeanInk/Analysis/InfoTreeTraversal.lean">https://github.com/leanprover/LeanInk/blob/main/LeanInk/Analysis/InfoTreeTraversal.lean</a> which traverses the resulting data structures, the so-called <code>InfoTree</code>. If you are lucky then maybe you don't need to read that code at all, you can use the json output of LeanInk.</p>
