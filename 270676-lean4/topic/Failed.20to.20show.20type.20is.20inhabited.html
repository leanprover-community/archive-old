<p>I'm getting an issue <code>failed to compile partial definition, failed to show type is inhabited</code><br>
However, I can create a proof that the type in question is inhabited. How do I get lean to compile my function?</p>

<p>Ah I think I see where I went wrong. This is somewhat odd. If I have the two functions</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">partial</span> <span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">unsafeFn1</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">m</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">Monad</span> <span class="n">m</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">)</span>  <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">m</span> <span class="n">α</span> <span class="o">:=</span>
  <span class="n">unsafeFn1</span> <span class="n">a</span>

<span class="n">partial</span> <span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">unsafeFn2</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">m</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">Monad</span> <span class="n">m</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">m</span> <span class="n">α</span> <span class="o">:=</span>
  <span class="n">unsafeFn2</span> <span class="n">a</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then the first is considered inhabited (because of <code>pure</code>) and the second is not. Furthermore, I'm not sure how to prove it is because I'd have to provide arguments to <code>Inhabited</code> in somewhat of an odd way.<br>
My issue is that I wrote the definition the second way instead of the first way (however I wrote the inhabited proof the first way, so they wouldn't line up)</p>

<p>When I try to compile that the first definition causes the compiler to loop and the server becomes unresponsive until I restart it</p>

<p>yes, that's another problem, but if you write it in a different (but still non-total way) it works</p>

<p>Adding an inhabited instance such as</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">instance</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">m</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Inhabited</span> <span class="o">((</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">Monad</span> <span class="n">m</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">m</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="n">where</span>

<p>causes the second definition to work, at least until it hits the same loop as definition 1</p>
