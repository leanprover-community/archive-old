<p>Hey all! I am excited to have my local Lean4 setup working from source. I had a few issues getting it to compile, so wanted to share what I learned in case it would be helpful for others. Also let me know if this isn't the right place to post this sort of thing.</p>
<p>I am running macOS Catalina 10.15.7, and as I was trying to build, I would get two different errors: <code>      'stdlib.h' file not found
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</code> and <code>ld: library not found for -lgmp</code>.</p>
<p>I finally managed to successfully build, after creating a conda environment and setting some environmental variables. With an <code>environment.yml</code> set to:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="YAML"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">lean4</span>
<span class="nt">channels</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">conda-forge</span>
<span class="nt">dependencies</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">clang</span>
<span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">clangxx</span>
<span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">cmake</span>
<span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">gmp</span>
<span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">ccache</span>
<span class="p p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">make</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I then ran:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Fish"><pre><span></span><code>conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate lean4
mkdir -p build/release
<span class="k">cd</span> build/release

env <span class="nv">CXX</span><span class="o">=</span>clang++ <span class="nv">CC</span><span class="o">=</span>clang  <span class="nv">C_INCLUDE_PATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$CONDA_PREFIX</span>/include <span class="nv">LIBRARY_PATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$CONDA_PREFIX</span>/lib  <span class="nv">SDKROOT</span><span class="o">=(</span>xcrun --sdk macosx --show-sdk-path<span class="o">)</span>  cmake ../..
env <span class="nv">CXX</span><span class="o">=</span>clang++ <span class="nv">CC</span><span class="o">=</span>clang  <span class="nv">C_INCLUDE_PATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$CONDA_PREFIX</span>/include <span class="nv">LIBRARY_PATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$CONDA_PREFIX</span>/lib  <span class="nv">SDKROOT</span><span class="o">=(</span>xcrun --sdk macosx --show-sdk-path<span class="o">)</span>  make
</code></pre></div>
<p>I always get confused by the compiler toolchain, so I am not recommending my method to others, but just wanted to share what worked for me!</p>
<p>Now that it's working, I am loving the dev experience in VS code, especially the ability to see the type for whatever is under the cursor. <span aria-label="party ball" class="emoji emoji-1f38a" role="img" title="party ball">:party_ball:</span></p>

<p>I (a regular ol' user) was personally aware of the gmp issue and needing to set <code>SDKROOT</code> manually. The rest I <em>think</em> might be conda-specific, which I assume you're using for some non-Python deps (but which obviously is good info to share with others)</p>

<p>I sent a (bad) PR for fixing the need to manually tell it where gmp was but it was the wrong approach so I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span> mentioned a better way to do it which may make this more seamless but I'm not sure PRs are welcome to implement it quite yet. But right now when I compile, I do something similar to what you showed and run <code>rm -rf build/release &amp;&amp; mkdir -p build/release &amp;&amp; cd build/release &amp;&amp; cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/lean4/nightly/ ../.. &amp;&amp; make -j4 SDKROOT=$(xcrun --sdk macosx --show-sdk-path)</code>, with my libgmp coming from homebrew rather than conda</p>

<p>How did you solve the gmp issues? I installed gmp via homebrew, but it fails to link to it. I've looked through the CMakeLists.txt but found no obvious fix.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="130511">@Christian Pehle</span> something similar to the above should work where you set <code>LIBRARY_PATH</code>, e.g. <code>cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$(brew --prefix) -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/where/you/want/to/install -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=$(brew --prefix)/lib ../..</code></p>
<p>I forget off-hand what I tweaked to make it not even necessary to do so myself (it's not permanently setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH and friends in the environment, perhaps it's just that I have all the homebrew compilers first in <code>PATH</code> and they know to look in the Homebrew cellar for libraries) -- but if the above doesn't work and you're still seeing an issue, sharing the error we can probably help figure out what to set.</p>
