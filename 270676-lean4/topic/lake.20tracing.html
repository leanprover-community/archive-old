<p>many other build systems provide a verbose trace of every command line being invoked, like <code>make --trace</code>.  Does Lake have something like that?  I'm trying to debug something and a trace of all command might be useful...</p>

<p>Doesn't lake print this trace already per default? When I run a lake build from scratch I see a lean compiler invocation per file and the final one that links things together</p>

<p>Yeah, as Henrik says, that should be default. My future goal in this regard has been to do the opposite (print a nice file by file percent progress without the verbose trace as the new default).</p>
