<p>I just installed Lean4, so newbie questions:<br>
I notice that <code>ℕ</code> is not defined by default (<code>unknown identifier 'ℕ'</code>), while <code>Nat</code> is.</p>
<ol>
<li>What do I need to import to get <code>ℕ</code> as an alias for <code>Nat</code>?</li>
<li>How do I go in general about searching for stuff in the libraries? Is there some kind of "Hoogle" equivalent? Can I access it or some other useful search feature from the VSCode plugin?</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>You could use mathlib4 which probably defines this notation or define it yourself with <code>notation "ℕ" =&gt; Nat</code> but there is no built in for it at the moment</li>
<li>There is currently some work on documentation (And documentation exploration) tooling but its still in very very early stages, I usually use a mix of looking at the auto completion suggestions + grepping in the lean4 repository but I don't know whether there is a better way right now, there very well might be.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="457686">@Vladimir Marko</span> Lean 4 is very much still in its early stages, so there is not much tooling yet. If you want that level of support, it is best to stick with Lean 3 for now. As <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="395550">@Henrik Böving</span> ,you can add mathlib4 as a dependency if you want to get the <code>ℕ</code> notation. Note, though, that mathlib4 is not a complete port of mathlib yet, so it will be missing out on a lot theorems / tactics / etc. that you may want.</p>

<p>Once you have mathlib4, you can <code>import Mathlib.Tactic.LibrarySearch</code> and use <code>librarySearch</code> as a helper for finding things. As Mac said, however, the mathematics library has not been ported to Lean 4 yet, so there's not much to find!</p>
