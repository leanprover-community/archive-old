<p>I've been looking into building a quickcheck implementation for Lean and I noticed that in the original quickcheck paper they mention that the Gen monad is in fact not a lawful monad due to the way it is implemented by splitting the RNG into two seperate ones and passing one down to each computation in the bind implementation.</p>
<p>Now I've been wondering why exactly it is done like this and not with a State monad wrapping around an RNG? It would be a lawful monad like this and you'd still be carrying an RNG around with you. It would also mimick the behaviour of an RNG in the imperative world since there it usually has global state (well here it is not global but you get the point)</p>
<p>so my question: Why exactly is it done via the split method on RNG instead of via a state monad? If they worry about efficiency they could also use some sort of ref as well?</p>

<p>(Is this related to <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/tactic/slim_check.lean"><code>slim_check</code></a> in Lean 3? Sorry for the noise if not.)</p>

<p>Yes it could be used to implement a tactic like this. In general quickcheck is a tool for what software engineers calls "property based testing" so instead of specifying test cases yourself, e.g. <code>1 + 2 == 2 + 1</code> you tell quickcheck, here I have some function with inputs x y z, generate n input pairs for me and check whether this function always returns true. If it doesn't (this is new in quickcheck v2) try to figure out a minimal counter example based on the inputs you found.</p>
<p>And of course this could be used as a tactic to quickly check whether a theorem is bogus as well, just like slim_check.</p>

<p>Yeah something like this was what I was curious about as well, the split doc string mentions that it has to ensure both new RNGs are independent but in a verified world we'd actually like a proof for what as well which seems very complicated.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how (or why) you would make slimcheck verified anyways--I guess you could try to state that the PRNG is indistinguishable from randomness under some computational complexity assumption, but surely you can't prove it</p>

<p>The Coq folks at least seem to be interested in verifying parts of their quickcheck variant (they very creatively called it QuickChick, if someone has an idea for Lean feel free to tell me :p) although it is not concerned with properties of the RNG but rather with properties of the value generators themselves.</p>

<p>I havent fully read through their paper yet and admitedly my Coq skills are kinda non existent? I'm just reading it like I would read Lean code really haha. But I'm definitely planning to understand what both quick check and chick are doing before actually getting this done, the question in the thread just sprang to my attention very early on since the Gen monad is so fundamental to this.</p>

<p>I'm saying that slim_check is a port of quickcheck to lean 3, so if you are working on a port to lean 4 then the existing thing should at least be considered rather than redoing the work</p>

<p>Look at the proof.  At the proof, ah, syntax, of various lemmas. Then, bearing in mind the local topology of these lemmas, and the various topologies induced by various variants of already proved theorems used, cunningly relax the lemmas.  That is, remove or weaken things used in the proof. So, not add stuff, but remove.  Obviously Math Zero will both weaken and strengthen, and deform sideways, everything in sight.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="395550">@Henrik Böving</span> I'd be happy to see <code>slim_check</code> ported to Lean 4. Let me know if you want to discuss some of the design decisions</p>

<p>Sure! I'm still reading into all the three variants I've found interesting so far (Haskell Coq Lean) but I'll get back here with more questions sooner or later probably, but so far I'm very much liking the slim_check variant, are there some things you were limited in by 3 that you would've done in another way if possible?</p>

<p>I can't think of any particular pain points in what is up there. I started experimenting with generators on my own but I never got to something I found usable. The generators seemed too slow to be used within Lean. I was trying it out on a typing relation for a programming language. I remember that proving the termination of those generators would get really hairy.</p>

<p>I'm hoping that ramping up the performances in Lean 4 could help make the library more usable. For the termination problem, it might just be that staying out of <code>meta</code>-land was overly ambitious and that something more useful could be produced by cutting some corners.</p>

<p>I was especially attached to the fact that the type of testing functions would promise that every counterexample was actually sound. I don't know if that would have to be compromised to improve the usability.</p>
