<p>I was under the impression that strong normalization was about going beyond unification and potentially simplifying the terms themselves (i.e. descend and reduce under lambda abstractions).</p>

<p>Ah, actually that's a good point. I'm talking about the algorithm used by <code>rfl</code> or <code>by decide</code>; I'm not sure exactly what <code>#reduce</code> uses</p>

<p>You need all that for unification as well. The elaboration unifier is a strict superset of the kernel defeq checker (...modulo some details, I think).</p>

<p>As the reduction is purely symbolic, I would probably prefer to call it normal order evaluation</p>

<p>Also note that there is no operation for full normalization in either the kernel or the basic elaborator, as that would be a waste of time on a strict expression data type. <code>whnf</code> is sufficient for type checking. Full normalization exists only for <code>#reduce</code> (and <code>conv</code> <code>reduce</code>).</p>
