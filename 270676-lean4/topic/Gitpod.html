<p>Does anyone have a best practice guideline for using Lean 4 with Gitpod? This used to work:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/avigad/lamr">https://github.com/avigad/lamr</a><br>
But now it gives the message:</p>
<p>info: downloading component 'lean'<br>
  error: binary package was not provided for 'linux'</p>
<p>I can fix it by typing <code>elan self update</code> and then <code>lake build</code> in the terminal and then restarting the server. But if I try adding <code>lean self update</code> to the <code>init</code> portion of the <code>.yml</code> file, it doesn't work.</p>
<p>As a fallback, I suppose I can delete the line that fetches elan and let the Lean 4 extension do it. But it would be nice to do <code>lake build</code> in the <code>init</code> section, because Gitpod will prebuild the image with that and make loading faster.</p>

<p>Update: updating elan in the Dockerfile (instead of the yml file) seems to have done the trick! So, never mind (unless someone has a better solution).</p>

<p>Any change to the Dockerfile probably would have been sufficient because it would invalidate the cached image. You can also do so manually without editing the file, <a href="https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image#manually-rebuild-a-workspace-image">https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image#manually-rebuild-a-workspace-image</a></p>

<p>Wanting to get a little experience with Lean 4, I recently watched Scott's tutorial on porting things to Lean 4. I started following the instructions but I stopped when it got to the point where I had to actually install Lean 4, because it was telling me I would have to update elan, and I was afraid that would interfere with my Rosetta installation of elan. Is there a way of working on mathlib4 through Gitpod?</p>

<p>Is there a reason that video is unlisted by the way <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> ? I thought it was a good tutorial on the porting process.</p>

<p>Only that it seemed likely to quickly become outdated. I don't mind if it is switched to public so people can find it on the leanprover-community YouTube page. I'm away from a computer at that moment but if I remember tomorrow I'll change the setting.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve found packing more instructions in the Dockerfile than in the bespoke config files (either GitPod or Codespaces) to generally be better.</p>

<p>I'm not aware of anything that could go wrong with that fwiw. You should not need a second elan.</p>
