<p>Do you have a problematic instance in mind? There are many possible definitions of <code>Ring</code>, but the simplest one would start with</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="n">Ring</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">A</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="n">where</span>

  <span class="n">multiplicative</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Monoid</span> <span class="n">A</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>and then you would set these fields explicitly when constructing a specific ring. Note that for types with multiple monoidal/... structures, you would use the name of the "instance" (which should be a regular <code>def</code> in this case to avoid ambiguity) explicitly as well when accessing theorems. For example, if there exist <code>Monoid.foo [Monoid A] ...</code> and <code>Nat.multiplicative : Monoid Nat</code>, you could access the multiplicative instance via <code>Nat.multiplicative.foo</code>.</p>

<p>You're missing the distributivity axioms here.  Practically speaking, Ring already extends two mixed additive/multiplicative structures: MonoidWithZero and Distrib.  Also, further extending this kind of construction seems hard, you can't do <code>class CommRing (A) extends Ring A, CommMonoid A</code> anymore.</p>

<p>One thing that is still annoying is that we need to define <code>class monoid</code> and <code>class add_monoid</code> manually, because you can't programmatically declare structures in Lean 3.  In Lean 4, we'll hopefully be able to say <code>@[toAdditive] class Monoid</code>.</p>

<p>When I arrived here I thought that treating multiplicative groups and additive groups as different objects was totally crazy because they're obviously the same and this just underlined how weirdly computer scientists thought about mathematics. Four years on I think it's a really insightful idea because it has shown me how mathematicians treat multiplication and addition as different objects in some kind of hierarchy that I didn't understand beforehand (which also contains the binary operators \bub and [x,y]).</p>
<p>Semirings are a natural example where a type has two monoid structures and our current solution works really well. A mathematician might in theory come along demanding that semirings with random different notation instead of + and * should exist but in practice nobody uses such a thing.</p>

<p>One thing I haven't seen mentioned before would be to generate additive and multiplicative definitions from a more abstract monoid definition. That might at least look less weird to outsiders, although maybe has little else going for it</p>
