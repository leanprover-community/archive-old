<p>Going back to what you said at the beginning about your use case, you might try adding a <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/typeclass.html?highlight=default#default-instances">default instance</a> for your membership instance.</p>
<p>The specific example of <code>HAdd</code> in that isolated context without the expected type is sort of an edge case, but as soon as the expected type is known (as it usually would be in context) the default instance kicks in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah yes, I think that's what I've been looking for! Thank you to both of you</p>
