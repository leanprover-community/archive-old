<p>Hiya <span aria-label="wave" class="emoji emoji-1f44b" role="img" title="wave">:wave:</span> I've been following along with the FP in Lean book (which has been absolutely great so far) and I think one of the exercises has a copy-paste error? Specifically, in <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/functional_programming_in_lean/props-proofs-indexing.html">the interlude about proofs</a> it asks to prove <code>5 &lt; 18</code> using <code>rfl</code>, which I don't think makes sense? For context, it's one among other propositions (that all do use <code>=</code>) in that example and the very next example asks to prove the same props using <code>by simp</code> which would make sense for <code>5 &lt; 18</code>, and is why I think this is just a small editing error. Just looking for clarification in my understanding or to report this error <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>

<p>That does sound like an error! There is a <a href="#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/Functional.20Programming.20in.20Lean">thread</a> about the book you could report this on.</p>
