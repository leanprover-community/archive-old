<p>I remember being positively surprised by how snappy the language server was in 4.0.0-M1.<br>
But now there seems to be a one second delay before you get any response from lean.</p>

<p>That would most likely be <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/285">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/285</a> :)<br>
We haven't fine-tuned the delay yet, and it also feels much longer than that sometimes, not sure about that yet</p>

<p>I think something more like 200ms is appropriate - slow enough that if you are in the middle of typing it doesn't try to elaborate all the time but picking up as soon as you stop or slow down</p>

<p>100ms would be great since that's about when people notice a delay but that's too fast for typing so you probably won't get much benefit from a delay that shourt</p>

<p>yeah, rather than delaying the processing you can just cancel the previous elaboration, although that causes issues if the processing delay is long because then the user doesn't get any response until they stop and wait</p>

<p>Yeah, the plan is to make it an editor option. Users should also be able to set it to 0 in which case elaboration is launched immediately, but beware that this will absolutely eat up your CPU. Personally I don't find it useful to see diagnostics for every half-typed word, so I would use at least 200ms.</p>

<p>And the <a href="https://lawsofux.com/laws/doherty-threshold/">Doherty Threshold</a> article linked there suggests &lt; 400ms is necessary to make Lean "addictive"... I am very far from an expert on this but 500ms seems like a very long default value from my recent experience.</p>

<p>Would it be at all feasible to maybe prioritize elaboration?  e.g., You may want the current declaration and visible declarations to be elaborated quickly, but happy to queue up inferring effects on other definitions until more time has passed.</p>

<p>Lean 3 <em>both</em> prioritizes visible declarations (by default), and has a mode to only elaborate on-screen content (you can click on the "(checking visible files)" in the status bar and change it to "visible lines", or "visible lines and above", or a few other options).</p>

<p>Unfortunately this is less useful than it could be, because Lean 3 can't lower the priority of a task again.  So once something has been on screen, Lean will prioritize it even if you switch to another file.  I was really happy to see this in Lean 4: files just stop elaborating when you switch to another file, and then continue when you switch back.</p>
