<p>Sebastian's talk just reminded me of an issue that has been on my mind for some time: the syntax <code>{a, b, c}</code> is ambiguous at the moment (with the set syntax from mathlib).  It can mean either:</p>
<ol>
<li>The structure instance <code>{ a := a, b := b, c := c }</code>, or</li>
<li>the "set" with the three elements <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> (or anything with insert and singleton operations).</li>
</ol>
<p>Currently the ambiguity is resolved by always picking (2), which is nonideal.  Another option would be to make the decision based on whether we have HasInsert and HasSingleton instances (but that means <code>#check {1,2,3}</code> doesn't work).  Yet another option would be to use a different syntax for set literals, but I don't see any common alternative to <code>{1,2,3}</code>.</p>

<p>At least in Lean 3 this was very important because the type would need to be available immediately.  Type class constraints can be solved later when the type is filled in.</p>
<p>In Lean 4 there is still a bit of an issue, where you might see <code>1 ∈ ?m...</code> in the context because the expected type of the set syntax is not available yet.  If we elaborate into the type class operations immediately, then you'll see <code>1 ∈ {a,b,c}</code> even if the type class instance is not synthesized yet.</p>

<p>It feels like a kinda bad idea to overload structure syntax, no? To programmer-me a finset is just a type of collection, so some sort of overloaded syntax for all collections would be worth considering; maybe overload #[...] syntax with an <code>OfList</code> typeclass?</p>

<p>I think having syntactic difference between notation does very much help readability of Lean code, especially once we start having more collections sticking all of them in just one type of syntax seems like a bad idea to me.</p>

<p>It's not ideal, but maybe the structure syntax could be extended to allow an optional <code>with</code> at the beginning, so to disambiguate you could write <code>{with a, b, c}</code>. This is meant to generalize the structure update syntax <code>{x with a, b, c}</code>, which works and is short for <code>{x with a := a, b := b, c := c}</code>.</p>

<p>Or another alternative is to not automatically do <code>a := a</code> right? E.g. it's a remote analogy, in Python there's <code>f"{name=}"</code> which prints <code>name = name</code>, so maybe in Lean doing <code>{a :=, b :=, c :=}</code> to expand to <code>a := a</code> etc. would be a possible resolution. Or maybe the other way is less ugly. <code>{:= a, := b, := c}</code>.</p>

<p>Yes, moving away from curly braces for structures at least seems quite unlikely to happen. <code>:= a</code> in fact would have been my original proposal in anticipation of this issue, but by it's hard to imagine moving away from the tantalizingly compact current notation as well...</p>

I collected a few examples here: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/master/tests/lean/run/setStructInstNotation.lean#L39-L71">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/master/tests/lean/run/setStructInstNotation.lean#L39-L71</a><br>
I tried to collect all examples posted here, and they all seem to be working. Do you have other examples that are not working?</p>
