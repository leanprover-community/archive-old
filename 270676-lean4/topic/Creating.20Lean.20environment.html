<p>I'd like to have a function that created a <code>Lean.Environment</code> from a file and lean search path.  The signature is something would be something like:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">loadEnv</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">filepath</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">importSearchPath</span><span class="o">:[</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">])</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">IO</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Lean.Environment</span> <span class="bp">Ã—</span> <span class="n">MessageLog</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="bp">...</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I've tried some experiments by copying code from <code>compileHeader</code> from <code>Lean.Server.FileWorker</code> but seem to be missing some detail, because I get <code>unknown package 'Init'</code>.</p>

<p>Forgive my naive question?  What exactly is in this file you would be using to build an environment?  A lean environment is a large thing since it contains all the declarations and proofs available .  Do you plan to have another function which dumps the environment to a file?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="115715">@Jason Rute</span> I was planning on using this to more easily build initial environments that one could use to build fine-grained benchmarks that time <code>simp</code> and other tactics.  This was based on an email thread with Adam Chlipala, so our interests may overlap.  Another option is to script Lean itself, but that has startup and parsing overhead. <br>
There are other uses potentially, e.g., I could use it to build a specialized compiler for some declarations.  I known the Lean server and Lean itself have to do this, but that code was a bit complex for me to navigate initially.  I'll probably do some more reading when I have time if there isn't a simple solution that I am overlooking.</p>

<p>There are tricks in Lean 3 for setting the environment to what is was right before a particular declaration.  Indeed, they have proven very useful for testing (in our case we were testing theorem proving AIs which generate proofs using only the premises available in the environment before that declaration was proved).  I highly suspect these tricks were not ported to Lean 4, nor will they be, so I'd be curious to know if there is a more canonical way in Lean 4.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110994">@Joe Hendrix</span> Check the function <code>runFrontend</code><br>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/master/src/Lean/Elab/Frontend.lean#L101">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/master/src/Lean/Elab/Frontend.lean#L101</a><br>
We used <code>runFrondEnd</code> for testing.  You can implement <code>loadEnv</code> by copying this function and modifying the last few lines.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="115715">@Jason Rute</span> You don't need any tricks to do that in Lean 4. Users can create standalone programs that <code>import Lean</code>.<br>
The function <code>runFrontend</code> is processing a Lean file. Users can write their own version. It is all implemented in Lean.<br>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112857">@Leonardo de Moura</span>  Thank you.  This plus calling <code>initSearchPath</code> solved the problem for me.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112857">@Leonardo de Moura</span> In light of this thread and <a href="#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/pure.20IO/near/231219371">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/pure.20IO/near/231219371</a>, should we make <code>SearchPath</code> an explicit parameter of <code>importModules</code> and remove <code>searchPathRef</code>?</p>
