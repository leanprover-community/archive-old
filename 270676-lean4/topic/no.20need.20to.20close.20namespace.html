<p>I ran into an issue today which I was getting very confused about, and then it transpired that I hadn't closed a namespace and lean had failed to add the final definition in a file into the system. I cannot reproduce right now, annoyingly, but I can observe that</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">namespace</span> <span class="n">foo</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>compiles. Is this expected? In Lean 3 this didn't work.</p>

<p>I really like this new feature.</p>

<p>It could be the case that the error I thought was caused by not closing a namespace was instead caused by me not typing <code>leanpkg build</code> and then restarting Lean. I find the current behaviour quite counterintuitive when I am working on files A and B, with B importing A and me adding lemmas to both. In short, the namespace thing might be a red herring and it's just me not quite used to the new system.</p>

<p>Just for documentation purposes: I just ran into the same issue and was super confused at first.</p>
