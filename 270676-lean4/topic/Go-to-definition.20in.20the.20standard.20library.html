<p>With development builds of Lean 4, go-to-definition only works with elaborate hacks (i.e., you need to set an environment variable depending on the build you're using).  I was about to automatically set this environment variable in the vscode extension.  But then I noticed that there is a much cleaner solution, which is already explicitly supported by the server:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Bash"><pre><span></span><code>ln -sr src build/release/stage1/lib/lean/src
</code></pre></div>
<p>Is there a reason the cmake build doesn't create this symlink by default?</p>

<p>(Admittedly, one downside is that vscode doesn't resolve the symlink after go-to-definition.  So you end up editing files in <code>build/release/stage1/lib/lean/src</code>.)</p>

<p>Part of the reason might be that I don't use the cmake build system anymore, so I wouldn't notice :) ...</p>

<p>So should we do it only when <code>LEAN_SRC_PATH</code> is unset? Assuming that if it is set at <code>cmake</code> invocation, it is probably set in the editor as well</p>

<p>Surprisingly LEAN_SRC_PATH is used as a fallback and not as an override.</p>

<p>That seems like a reasonable (though slightly surprising) compromise.</p>

<p>Then let's change that instead</p>
