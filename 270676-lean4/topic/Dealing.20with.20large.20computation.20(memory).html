<p>What would be the idiomatic/ideal way of dealing with memory issues (where I'm running out of memory) in Lean4? I.e. if I know where I can serialize and store to disk some of my computation, is there a nice way to do this? Or perhaps phrase differently, how much does it involve me weaving IO into everything and defining a bunch of <code>toByteArray</code> functions manually?</p>

<p>It would definitely involve weaving IO around everywhere, at least without substantial hacks <span aria-label="thinking" class="emoji emoji-1f914" role="img" title="thinking">:thinking:</span></p>
<p>RE: serialization, we could definitely derive serializations for most types. that would actually be a quite useful library, if you don't want to build it I might</p>
<p>RE: weaving IO around everything, what I would personally do is set up your computation to be parameterized by the disk-saved values it needs. then you can do all the IO to save partial results to disk, open files, etc. in one top-level function, instead of having to pass IO around everywhere</p>

<p>It's basically an exhaustive search over a transition system (operational semantics) to check wether some behaviors are possible</p>

<p>Lean has internal serialization (and zero-cost mmap deserialization) routines that can handle any Lean value except for closures and external types. This is used for .olean files, but not currently exposed as a general Lean API.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span> if I understand correctly, the internal serialization is just copying the Lean ABI representation of the value? (with some sort of special handling to ensure the reference counts are correct?)</p>
<p>The only issue with the ABI encoding is space efficiency. A serialization routine that optimizes better for space would be useful for network applications, but I am guessing the internal serialization would be fine for <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="315434">@Andrés Goens</span> 's application</p>

<p>Yeah, specialized encodings could be much more space-efficient. And the internal serialization might require non-trivial work before it could be exposed as a general API. For example, the serialized objects do not contain reference counts at all, so there is no safe way to free them.</p>
