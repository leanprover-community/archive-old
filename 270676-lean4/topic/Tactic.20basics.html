<p>I wrote a function that generates an escape path for the mazes in <a href="https://github.com/dwrensha/lean4-maze">lean4-maze</a>.<br>
Now I would like to write a tactic that automatically proves that a maze is escapable (if possible), but have no idea how to transform my escape path into a sequence of tactics.</p>
<p>For context, a maze looks something like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">maze1</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="bp">┌──────┐</span>
             <span class="bp">│▓▓▓▓▓▓│</span>
             <span class="bp">│▓░░@░▓│</span>
             <span class="bp">│▓░░░░▓│</span>
             <span class="bp">│▓░░░░▓│</span>
             <span class="bp">│▓▓▓▓░▓│</span>
             <span class="bp">└──────┘</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We can prove that we can escape it, by using the <code>east</code>, <code>west</code>, <code>south</code> and <code>north</code> tactics:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">example</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">can_escape</span> <span class="n">maze1</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="kd">by</span>
  <span class="n">east</span>
  <span class="n">south</span>
  <span class="n">west</span>
  <span class="bp">...</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>My function takes a maze (<code>GameState</code>) and generates a list of <code>Move</code>s that form an escape route (if possible):</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">inductive</span> <span class="n">Move</span>
  <span class="bp">|</span> <span class="n">east</span> <span class="bp">|</span> <span class="n">west</span> <span class="bp">|</span> <span class="n">north</span> <span class="bp">|</span> <span class="n">south</span>

<span class="n">partial</span> <span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">escapePath</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">g</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">GameState</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Option</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">List</span> <span class="n">Move</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="bp">...</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I would like to write a tactic that takes a maze, generates the list of required moves and turns those into applications of the corresponding tactics.<br>
I'm guessing the structure would be like this, but I don't know how to fill it:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">macro</span> <span class="s2">"escape"</span> <span class="n">m</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">term</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">tactic</span> <span class="bp">=&gt;</span> <span class="bp">`</span><span class="o">(</span> <span class="bp">???</span> <span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Where do I start?</p>

<p>I'm far from an expert, so take this with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>TBH, what you are doing looks a little backwards to me. If <code>escapePath</code> already returns a list of moves, then couldn't you easily change it to return an instance of <code>can_escape</code> directly, eliminating the need to invoke a tactic?</p>
<p>Normally, I would expect the <em>tactic</em> to produce the list of moves. But then you probably don't want to write a <code>macro</code> but an <code>elab</code>, and implement the algorithm as monadic code.</p>
<p>If you really want to write a macro the way you wrote it, what you will need to do (I think) is to essentially run <code>#eval</code> on <code>escapePath</code> applied to <code>m</code> (not sure how to do it, but it's certainly possible) and recursively convert the resulting syntax tree.</p>

<p>I second this. If you want to have the tactic interactive with current game state you need a elaborate not a macro. Macros are essentially purely syntactic transformations, you cannot retrieve information about the state of the proof from within them.</p>

<p>I don't think this is actually possible with a macro. <code>#eval</code> is a command and I don't think there is way to invoke such a command with the built-in tactics (and thus no way to use it in a tactic macro).</p>

<p>I ended up going for the approach below. Note that I've removed the explicit <code>m</code> parameter for the tactic, and instead extract it from the goal state.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I'm still stuck at actually running the tactics that correspond to the moves (in the match-expression).<br>
How would I run a tactic here?</p>

<p>This is just a practice example for me to learn some tactic/meta stuff in Lean.<br>
So if the approach is weird, that probably has to do with that.</p>

<p>Just FYI, that code is actually not unreachable. That match case just implies that the tactic in question is ill-formed (i.e., someone typo'd in attempt to construct the <code>Syntax</code> of the tactic). Thus, a better message would be, for example, "Ill-formed <code>escape</code> tactic."</p>

<p>Ah, the way you are using <code>escape_path</code> is a bit different than I thought. It's a bit unusual, but that doesn't make it wrong of course. Basically, you are using object-level code at the meta level as well. In particular, what <code>extractGameState</code> really does is a sort of reflection, converting an object-level expression of type <code>GameState</code> into a meta-level instance of <code>GameState</code>. That way, <code>escape_path</code> actually becomes part of the tactic, which makes some of what I have written above moot.</p>
<p>(This actually creates an interesting ambiguity regarding what "running the tactics that correspond to the moves" actually means, because you now have a choice between running the tactic at the object level (as you normally would) or at the meta level (and then convert the resulting escape path back in the reverse direction of <code>extractGameState</code>). I assume you mean the former.)</p>
<p>I haven't tried running tactics from tactics, but I think the function you are looking for is <code>evalTacticAt</code>. You'd start with <code>mvarId</code> being the result of <code>getMainGoal</code>, and then each invocation of <code>evalTacticAt</code> should give you either 0 or 1 new goals, depending on whether that move escaped the maze. (It's probably easiest to write it as a recursive function rather than a loop; not sure about the implications of either style in Lean.)</p>
