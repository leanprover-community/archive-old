<p>As pointed out earlier in <a href="#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/implementing.20.60.28x.29/near/236978085">implementing '(x)</a>, <code>quote</code> and <code>toExpr</code> use <code>id</code> as their instances for <code>Syntax</code> and <code>Expr</code> respectively. This runs contrary to invariants one might expect from such classes (ex.,<code>$(quote x) = x</code> or <code>inferType (toExpr x) = toTypeExpr</code>). However, the Lean sources make use of the <code>id</code> behavior so removing it is out of the question (see <a href="#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/implementing.20.60.28x.29/near/236951821">this response</a> of <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span> ).</p>
<p>I propose a different solution: create two different sets of functions -- one which preserves the <code>id</code> behavior and one which preserves the desired invariants. I suggest the names <code>toSyntax</code>/<code>toExpr</code> for the <code>id</code> preserving versions and <code>quote</code>/<code>reflect</code> for invariant preserving versions.</p>
<p>To define these functions, I propose using three sets of classes: <code>Quote</code>/<code>Reflect</code> to hold the common instances, <code>ToSyntax</code>/<code>ToExpr</code> for the <code>id</code> versions, and <code>QuoteAux</code>/<code>ReflectAux</code> for the invariant versions.</p>
<p>For example:</p>

<p><strong>What do people think of this solution?</strong></p>
<p>In particular, I'm curious, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span>, what you think of this proposal considering that you also found the current behavior problematic. I am also interested in whether <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span> finds this to be a happy medium between the current <code>id</code> versions and the desired invariant preserving versions.</p>

<p><strong>I think the think <code>Expr</code> and <code>Syntax</code> versions of the quotation should be similar (they should behavior in a parallel manner).</strong> Since the Lean developers utilize the <code>id</code> behavior (per <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span>  post) for <code>Syntax</code>, there needs to be a class which has the <code>id</code> behavior for <code>Syntax</code>. Thus, to keep the two notions parallel, there should be an class with the <code>id</code> behavior for <code>Expr</code>, hence my proposal.</p>

<p>Alternatively, find a way to solve the problems that they are using this instance for in another way, e.g. with antiquotations</p>

<p>Yes I do. By having this in core, these instances can be updated as Lean's representations change. For example, just yesterday a change was pushed that altered the representation of <code>SourceInfo</code> which would break any custom quotation instances built on it. Since this deals with a core part of  Lean and abstracts away implementation details I think it should be located in the core.</p>

<p>The common instances between the two (i.e. those in <code>Quote</code> in my proposal) are exactly the same as the are in the <code>Quote</code> in the Lean core, the only difference is in <code>QuoteAux</code>. That is, <code>Quote</code> + <code>ToSyntax</code> is exactly identical to the current representation in the Lean core (just split across two classes to support the definition of <code>QuoteAux</code>). The same is true for <code>Reflect</code> + <code>ToExpr</code>.</p>

<p>To me, it makes no sense for a metaprogramming language such as Lean to not have reflection for all its compatible core types (especially since it already partially has them). It greatly reduces code duplication and maintenance on the part of end-users to have the instances defined with there corresponding definitions. </p>
<p>Honestly, it would be desirable to have <code>deriving</code> support for them (which, despite being a large undertaking initially, would possible reduce the maintenance burden in the long run). I do realize though, this is not currently a priority for the Lean developers.  The only reason I suggested it is because the Lean developers recently added support for generating injectivity theorems, so I think this could eventual be a useful solution.</p>

<p>I don't disagree with you, but we have to be very careful not to put too much work on the very small lean dev team. Please collect "stuff that probably should be in lean core but isn't" elsewhere if it's not essential to the functionality of something already in lean core. I recommend using the <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/">mathlib4</a> library for this because it is the only library currently planning to take on this maintenance burden.<br>

<p>FYI: I was opposed to the name "mathlib" originally, I called it "stdlib" but leo changed this during the initial split from lean 3. In any case it has never only been about math, but the branding had the effect you are indicating, and at this point it's too late to change the name.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the way lean development works does not currently permit this state of affairs. All external (to the lean dev team) work on lean is currently concentrated in the "leanprover-community" organization, and right now the focus is on building up mathlib4 as the place to go for std++ stuff. Maybe someday we can get closer to the model you are talking about, but lean 4 is not that kind of open source.</p>

<p>I feel like this is directly opposed to the stated goal of making Lean 4 a general purpose programming language. I highly doubt anyone is going to think of it that way if the "stdlib" of the library is called "mathlib" and the vast majority of  the discussion on the forums is from people deep in mathematics. This doesn't really both me as computer scientist also heavily interested in mathematical theory. However, this is certainly not true of a lot of modern computer scientists, some of whom stay as far away from pure math as possible, but still, I believe, would find Lean useful. Thus, I think that segment out the core programming/metaprogramming additions into a separate library (that mathlib probably depends on) would greatly help move Lean's image in that direction.</p>
<p>I do agree that throwing a lot of what would be a in normal "corelib" is a no go  given the current development cycle of Lean. I also don't think that is bad thing. I think the small dev team actually makes the language much more focused and refined than a lot of others (like Haskell and C++).  I think that is what drew me to it. However, I do feel this proposal is a bit of a special case since virtually all the pieces are virtually there. </p>
<p>I am also perfectly content with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110043">@Gabriel Ebner</span> solution. This is mostly a statement of a wish.</p>

<p>I don't think it's a bad thing that lots of mathematicians are involved. It's sad that there aren't more computer scientists, but there are at least a dozen people who are relatively active here and quite good at writing metaprogramming tools for mathlib or otherwise. But I don't think that the number of people involved has anything to do with the stated focus of the (mathlib) project. It's certainly not anything I have any control over, so I don't worry about it so much. As you say, lean 4 is more focused on being a general purpose programming language, but it's already quite clear that it will not have a large built in standard library, there just isn't the manpower, so having a good std++ library is more important than ever.</p>

<p>Sorry, It wasn't my intent to criticize that. As I said, I quite enjoy many of the deep math discussions here (and by "on the forums" I meant here on Zullip). I have no qualms with the people involved. I just think it may help to also have computer science targeted std++ as well. I am not saying this should be part of the Lean core, but that there should be some sore of a separate package from mathlib that incorporates the more general additions and targets a more general audience.</p>

<p>I'd like to weigh in on this. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="315577">@Mac</span> the kind of thing you are proposing is exactly the kind of small library we would love to see come to life.</p>
<p>Your proposal looks self-contained and small. The most logical option for me would be a tiny separate library.</p>
<p>There are tons of missing features in the compiler. E.g. Look at Haskell's or F#'s List modules and you won't find zip3 or nth in Lean.</p>
<p>I've had this conversation with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112857">@Leonardo de Moura</span> repeatedly.</p>
<p>The reality for lean4 as of right now is, that we have a set of priorities due to our own stakeholders which you can roughly see in the projects tab in github and we very few core developers.</p>
<p>Like every normal agile project we need to work on high-prio items first. And given the tiny core team even reviewing PRs is taking a toll on the amount of resources we have to drive things forward. To help communicate we have created various tags like the <code>help wanted</code>, <code>PR not welcome</code>or <code>no plans to address</code>.</p>
<p>There are at least two different kinds of features that are very hard to get into core but would be great candidates for tiny self-contained libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>stuff that we just should have but won't ever bubble up the priority stack enough, like <code>zip3</code>, <code>nth</code> and pretty much everything in your typical Haskell or F# libraries.</li>
<li>stuff that's related to, but exactly identical to lean4 core functionality like your quotation effort. These are hard to review and don't contribute towards the priorities we are committed to deliver.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best solution for now, and potentially also long term, as it's good for the eco system, is building small self-contained libraries.</p>
<p>On the other hand we are commited to making lean4 great for metaprogramming and extensibility. So if you do come across stuff that you think blocks you from implementing stuff in your library, please reach out and we'll see what the gaps are and how we can help.</p>
