<p>I managed to implement the tactic I was trying to implement using <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256311">@Jannis Limperg</span> 's <code>Or.elim</code> suggestion, which involved creating metavariables of exactly the correct type, it was quite a long-winded way of doing it but certainly satisfied my interest in learning the DIY way of approaching it. I'm not exactly sure how to use <code>Lean.Meta.cases</code>, since it asks for an <code>FVarId</code>, but I only had the <code>Expr</code> corresponding to an <code>Or</code> hypothesis. Would I have to create the free variable to use that?</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="453098">@Dan Velleman</span> , your approach is interesting, and definitely something worth knowing. It's a little confusing how there are so many different ways to do these things. I'm sure this is somewhat inevitable but I hope in the future once the tooling has been developed, some best practice could be laid down to make it clearer to a newbie what the most idiomatic approach is.</p>
<p>Thanks to all of you! I'll mark this as resolved for now.</p>

<p>Nice! The direct <code>Or.elim</code> is also the most efficient solution, so that's a bonus.</p>
<p>To get an <code>FVarId</code> for an expression, you can <code>assert</code> it as a hypothesis, then possibly <code>clear</code> it again after you're done. At least this trick is occasionally used in Lean 3.</p>

<p>@Jannis Limperg, I assume you mean <code>assert</code> and then <code>intro1P</code>--as in the "custom_have" tactic in the online metaprogramming book.  I discovered today, by experimentation, that there are some differences between the <code>mvar</code> method and the <code>fvar</code> method.  I think the differences are caused by the fact that an <code>fvar</code> has a type but no value, whereas an <code>mvar</code>, if it has been assigned, has both a type and a value.  For my application, the <code>fvar</code> method works better--the value of the <code>mvar</code> was causing glitches that were minor but annoying, and they went away when I used an <code>fvar</code>.</p>

<p>Yes; I forgot that <code>assert</code> doesn't introduce the new hyp (although there might be a variant that does).</p>
<p>The <code>assert</code> method and the <code>exprToTerm</code> method are internally very different, but they should both work. I suspect that any errors you're getting are due to some other fault. If you'd like to share your code, I can take a closer look.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256311">@Jannis Limperg</span> :  Here's what I was doing:  I had two expressions <code>e1</code> and <code>e2</code>, and I wanted to replace <code>e1</code> with <code>e2</code> in either a hypothesis or the goal.  My method was to produce a proof of <code>e1 ↔ e2</code> and pass that proof to the <code>rewrite</code> tactic.  When I created a <code>fvar</code> of type <code>e1 ↔ e2</code> (using <code>assert</code> and <code>intro1P</code>) and passed that to <code>rewrite</code>, it worked fine.  When I created a <code>mvar</code> (using <code>exprToTerm</code>), <code>rewrite</code> looked at the proof that was the value of the <code>mvar</code>, not the type of the mvar.  It interpreted it as a proof of <code>e1 ↔ e2'</code>, for some expression <code>e2'</code> that was definitionally equivalent to <code>e2</code>, and so <code>e1</code> got replaced with <code>e2'</code>--not wrong, but not exactly what I wanted.</p>
<p>If you want more detail:  I was trying to change <code>¬ ∃ n, p n</code> to <code>∀ n, ¬ p n</code>.  When I used a <code>fvar</code>, it worked exactly as I wanted.  When I used a <code>mvar</code>, <code>¬ ∃ n, p n</code> got changed to <code>∀ x, ¬ p x</code>.</p>

<p>Hehe, okay, that's a good one. You might have been able to make the mvar solution work by adding some sort of type ascription to <code>exprToTerm</code>, forcing <code>rewrite</code> to use the type exactly as written. But I don't like this <code>exprToTerm</code> business that much anyway, so I don't mind if it leads to weird issues. <span aria-label="grinning face with smiling eyes" class="emoji emoji-1f601" role="img" title="grinning face with smiling eyes">:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:</span></p>

<p>I was thinking the <code>exprToTerm</code> solution was more efficient--<code>assert</code> and <code>intro1P</code> together introduce two new mvars, as well as doing all kinds of other stuff; <code>exprToTerm</code> does a lot less work, and there's no need to clear an <code>fvar</code> at the end.  But based on my experience, the <code>fvar</code> solution seems more reliable.</p>
<p>I wonder if the "type ascription" you refer to is what's going on here:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="sd">/--</span>
<span class="sd">  Convert the given goal `Ctx | target` into `Ctx |- targetNew`. It assumes the goals are definitionally equal.</span>

      <span class="n">return</span> <span class="n">mvarNew.mvarId</span><span class="bp">!</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The value assigned to <code>mvarId</code> near the end is not <code>mvarNew</code>, but rather <code>@id target mvarNew</code>.  Is the purpose of that to produce an expression whose type will be <code>target</code>, even though the type of <code>mvarNew</code> is <code>targetNew</code> (which is definitionally equal)?</p>

<p>Yup, that explains it.  In <code>exprToTerm</code>, if I change <code>Lean.MVarId.assign mv.mvarId! val</code> to <code>Lean.MVarId.assign mv.mvarId! (← Lean.Meta.mkExpectedTypeHint val type)</code>, the problem goes away.</p>

<p>Nice!</p>
<p>The <code>exprToTerm</code> method is almost certainly less efficient. It constructs a <code>Syntax</code> object which then gets interpreted by <code>evalTactic</code>, which dynamically dispatches to the elaborator for <code>rewrite</code>, which ultimately calls the implementation of <code>rewrite</code>. The fvar method, on the other hand, just statically calls the implementation of <code>rewrite</code>. Creating and assigning metavariables boils down to some lookups and inserts into persistent hashmaps, the cost of which should be negligible in comparison.</p>
<p>Of course, neither method should take any noticable amount of time if you only execute it once.</p>

<p>I was using <code>evalTactic</code> for both the <code>mvar</code> method and the <code>fvar</code> method, passing it a term referring to either the <code>mvar</code> or the <code>fvar</code>.  So, if I understand what you're saying, there's probably not much difference in efficiency, and anyway neither method will take a noticeable amount of time.  Perhaps the most important difference is that the <code>fvar</code> method seems more reliable.</p>
