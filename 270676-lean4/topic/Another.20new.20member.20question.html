<p>Hi,  Please let me know if there is a better place for these question.  I don't want to be a pest.  I posted this question as follow-up to a question I asked yesterday, feel free to delete either question.</p>
<p>I am trying to prove the following exercise (trimmed down version) of an exercise in "Theorem proving in Lean".  I have posted my best approach.  </p>

<p>I need to show (p x) and have  (p a)  for every a  in α.  So this should be sufficient.  How do I tell lean4 to notice this?   Any help will be appreciated.</p>
<p>There is some discussion about this in the tutorial, (there is a paragraph that reads : As was the case for implication, the propositions-as-types interpretation now comes into play. Remember the introduction and elimination rules for dependent arrow types: and then an example but I can't see how to use it)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="519925">@kvanvels</span> just to clarify: you are welcome to ask beginner Lean 4 questions in this stream; indeed it's exactly the right place to ask them.</p>

<p>As to your question, your goal does not look provable to me; maybe you took a wrong turn? I don't understand your claim "I have <code>p a</code> for every <code>a</code> in <code>α</code>"; in your goal state <code>a</code> is a fixed element of <code>α</code>.</p>

<p>Are you sure the statement has its parentheses in the right place?</p>

<p>Oh I think this (with the brackets as they are) isn't true constructively; you'll have to split on whether r is true or false, I don't think you can just follow your nose like you're doing.</p>

<p>Ah, that works indeed, or on <code>(∀ x, p x)</code> being true or false</p>

<p>I found the answer to this exercise in the book.  It is quite a bit more complicated than I expected.    I appreciate the responses.</p>
