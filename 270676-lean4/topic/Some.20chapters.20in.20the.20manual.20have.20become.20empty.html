<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>I've noticed that some chapters in the Lean 4 manual, which were previously full of text, has now become empty. For example <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/monads/transformers.lean.html">The chapter on monad transformers</a>. However the source file <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/master/doc/monads/transformers.lean">transformers.lean</a> in the repo is indeed full of useful content.<br>
I have tried to build the documentation from source with the same results.</p>
<p>Does anyone know why this is the case? Is it something strange with the build process or was the content so bad that it was better being removed?</p>

<p>Thanks for the report, should be fixed now</p>
