<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I'm trying to build a dependency (LSpec) with <a href="https://github.com/yatima-inc/Ipld.lean/blob/1c4377c9ed4ce40204e1490da284be11ae1a83f1/.github/workflows/lspec.yml#L20"><code>lake build LSpec</code></a> and almost everything seems to work nicely.</p>
<p>The problem I'm facing is that the <code>lspec</code> binary is not being generated and the next step is failing, as you can see <a href="https://github.com/yatima-inc/Ipld.lean/runs/7291843846?check_suite_focus=true">here</a>.</p>
<p>Both repos use today's toolchain (2022-07-11)</p>
<p>Is there something else I need to do on the <a href="https://github.com/yatima-inc/Ipld.lean/runs/7291843846?check_suite_focus=true">LSpec repo</a> for this to work? Thanks in advance!!</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://github.com/yatima-inc/LSpec/blob/main/lakefile.lean">yatima-inc/LSpec repository</a> , the executable is name <code>lspec</code> while the library is named <code>LSpec</code> so it is building the library rather than the executable.</p>

<p>Or were you trying to build the package <code>LSpec</code>? If so, then you need and <code>@</code> to disambiguate it (i.e., <code>lake build @LSpec</code>). Lake resolves targets in the order of custom target, executable, external library, lean library, package, and them module (see <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lake/blob/0d39b1eb67fb21b19399d3c1a696166c27eaa94f/Lake/CLI/Build.lean#L117-L141">here</a>). Package and modules are last because they can be disambiguated with <code>@</code> and <code>+</code>, respectively (as mentioned in <code>lake help build</code>).</p>

<p>Actually, now that I think about it a bit more, <code>pkg/</code> would be alternative, potentially more intuitive way to disambiguate package names.</p>

<p>That way I could use <code>@</code> for modules and remove <code>+</code> which I personally have never liked (it was only non-special character left in shell that I could think of at the time).</p>

<p>So I need to do <code>lake build lspec</code> instead?</p>

<p>A honest piece of feedback: I don't understand the difference between "package" and "library" according to Lake. I've seen a message saying that <code>Package</code> is deprecated, but then I tried removing it and the code no longer compiled.</p>
<p>I don't think Lake's readme is didactic enough</p>

<p>Ah, this  <a href="#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/Lake's.20package.20vs.20lean_lib.20vs.20lean_exe">Lake's package vs lean_lib vs lean_exe</a> thread by Yuri de Wit may help. I explained that deprecation message <a href="#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/Lake's.20package.20vs.20lean_lib.20vs.20lean_exe/near/286855829">here</a> and discussed the package and workspace terminology of Lake <a href="#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/Lake's.20package.20vs.20lean_lib.20vs.20lean_exe/near/286933597">here</a> and connected the concept of Lake library to its parallel in Racket <a href="#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/Lake's.20package.20vs.20lean_lib.20vs.20lean_exe/near/287117055">here</a>. I really do need to add a glossary to Lake's README.</p>

<p>Thank you!<br>
I will read that thread tomorrow. If I find the opportunity, I might also PR some pieces of information I find important (it you don't cover them first)</p>

<p>Added a <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lake#glossary-of-terms">Glossary of Terms</a> to Lake's README. Feel free to suggest improvements!</p>
