<p>Why is the default Lean  scope of notation within a namespace global rather than <code>scoped</code>? It seems like that later would be more natural. If you want global notation, it would make sense to define it outside of a namespace (or, if you really want to still do it inside you could potentially clarify your intention by adding a <code>global</code> attribute). However, generally if you are defining notation within a namespace, you probably are doing so because you want it scoped, and prepending every notation/syntax declaration with <code>scoped</code> is annoying.</p>

<p>I would tend to agree with this. However, we should be careful about consistency with other commands. We learned the hard way with Lean 2 that most commands/attributes, such as <code>instance</code>, should <em>not</em> be scoped by default. The experience was painful enough that the feature was removed entirely from Lean 3.</p>

<p>I can sympathize with the need to be careful, though I do think this is case where <code>scoped</code> should be the default. I would also note <code>instance</code> is very different beast. Outside of some very few exceptions (such as a <code>Monad</code> instances), if a class could have an instance, it should have the given instance, making adding an instance for an object only a positive, and not something you would want to restrict. However, fundamentally altering the syntax of the language is an entirely different matter, which one can easily want restricted.</p>
<p>Also, more generally many other attributes in Lean 3 were definitional. For example, <code>class</code> and <code>pattern</code>. It makes no sense for these attributes to be separated from their target by a scope as they are key parts of the definition. Syntax, however, is its own kind of definition, and just like <code>def</code>s are  scoped by default within their enclosing namespace, it makes sense for syntax to be.</p>

<p>Sort of? The problem here is that default "+" notation is also present so it clashes with your definition, making it ambiguous. If it was it was scoped to a namespace, you could choose whether or not you wished to enable it, but because its not, you can't.</p>
<p>However, there is a way to solve your issue, just given your notation a higher priority than the default notation:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="lean4"><pre><span></span><code>- defined my own list.append function
local infixl:65 (priority := high) " + " =&gt; list.append

<p>I think differing default priorities would be confusing. Though it might make sense for local/scoped parsers to preferred over global parsers when disambiguating notation (I would have it go local &gt; scoped &gt; global). -- It would also help if <code>Init</code> was in its own namespace that could be open and closed as desired. ;)</p>

<p>Well, my position is thus. Notation (i.e. parsers and macros) should be scoped by default. They should only effect syntax if their related <code>def</code> is in scope. Things like <code>class</code> should be global by default. They are permeant properties of their related <code>def</code>s and thus should not generally be able to be turned on and off by changes in scope (in fact, I am not sure if they should ever be). The <code>instance</code> attribute should similarly be global by default, as that is <em>generally</em> the desire (but unlike things like <code>class</code>, it definitely does have cases where being local/scoped is useful).</p>

<p>Also, there is one thing that I forgot to mention earlier that I am curious about. List concatenation is generally denoted with the <code>++</code> operator as opposed to the <code>+</code> operator. In fact, for this reason, there is actually no <code>Add</code> instance for the built-in <code>List</code>. So, technically, if you wanted to use <code>+</code> for a list you could just add an <code>Add</code> instance for it instead of defining new notation. All in all, I'm just a little curious as to why you decided to use <code>+</code> to denote concatenation.</p>

<p>Yes, the order of priority should probably be</p>

<p>Yes, the order of priority should probably be</p>
<ol>
<li>define a new typeclass instance for an existing notation (if available)</li>
<li>define a new macro rule for an existing notation (overrides the previous semantics)</li>
<li>define a new overlapping notation (more work for both the parser and elaborator, unless you <em>want</em> type-based disambiguation)</li>
</ol>

<p>How do you do number 2 with notation that is unnamed (like most of the built-in notation is)? I know that there are the auto-generated names, but using those feels very hackish (as I wouldn't be surprised if the generated names changed in the future). I guess another way to phrase this is: <strong>should you do number 2 with auto-named notation?</strong></p>

<p>Also, wouldn't number 2 require writing the same rule twice for two different kinds for notation that has both an ASCII and non-ASCII alternative? If number 2 is the preferred sty;e to number 3, I would have though that the built-in notation would be named (and would merge the ASCII and non-ASCII syntaxes into a single kind). Furthermore, the lacked of <code>scoped</code>/<code>local</code> <code>macro_rules</code> means that you would need to write the macro directly if you want either of those attributes.</p>

<p>I guess my point here is: <strong>I would never have thought that solution number 2 was preferred to solution number 3 with the way the built-in notation is structured.</strong> However, in retrospect, thinking about how parser works, I can see why 2 would technically be the preferable solution. This makes me wonder <em>why</em> the built-in notation is structured the way it is.</p>

<p>Yeah, <code>scope/local macro(_rules)</code> seems sensible to me. The duplication issue would be solved by making the ASCII notation use the Unicode notation (seems more sensible that way around), but we explicitly declare them in that order so the pretty printer of the latter wins, oops...</p>

<p>Why not just have the Unicode notation expand to the ASCII? Then you could still keep the auto-generated pretty printer that prints the Unicode alternative. I also don't see why having the ASCII notation as the base would hurt (as, when it comes to rule-writing, the ASCII notation is quicker to input).</p>

<p>Also, there is one thing that I forgot to mention earlier that I am curious about. List concatenation is generally denoted with the <code>++</code> operator as opposed to the <code>+</code> operator. In fact, for this reason, there is actually no <code>Add</code> instance for the built-in <code>List</code>. So, technically, if you wanted to use <code>+</code> for a list you could just add an <code>Add</code> instance for it instead of defining new notation. All in all, I'm just a little curious as to why you decided to use <code>+</code> to denote concatenation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh I'm just messing around with Lean4. To test type classes I just defined my own HasAdd typeclass and defined add for nat and decided to make an add for list that was actually append. Just the first thing that came to mind since the second type I made was list after nat. But yes ++ makes more sense.</p>

<p>Well no, obviously that is not Lean's philosophy. After all, there are many notations without ASCII alternatives. However, for those with them, such an approach  seems logical. Anyway, outside of the macro rule, code can pick whatever it wants to use. Also, given how the auto-generated pretty printers work, this seems to be the simplest solution.</p>
