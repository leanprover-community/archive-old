<p>I was reading through <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/monads/functors.lean.html">the Lean 4 manual entry for <code>Functor</code></a> (which is very nice, by the way!), and noticed that it doesn’t seem to be required that <code>Functor</code>s preserve the identity function. Or is it? If so, where do we provide a proof of that? If not, shouldn’t this be required somehow? Or are <code>Functor</code>s not really functors (though it seems to say so in the docs)?</p>

<p>The additional axioms are in the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=LawfulFunctor#doc">docs4#LawfulFunctor</a> typeclass. I think the idea is that it separates the concerns of programs and proofs -- while a program might depend on the axioms of a Functor to be correct, I think it's rare that you need to use the axioms of a functor in the middle of a program.</p>

<p>This means that <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Functor#doc">docs4#Functor</a> is something more general than a functor, but you're meant to only use it for actual functors.</p>

<p>Hmm, ok…is that a more typical definition for functional programmers? That would make sense…it is a bit of a gotcha coming from the math side, though! I might want to suggest a parenthetical be thrown into the part of the lean manual that says it’s the same as a categorical functor, like “(with the exception that a <code>Functor</code> in this context is not required to preserve identities)” or something.</p>

<p>Lean 3's mathlib has both <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/functor">docs#functor</a> (with its <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/is_lawful_functor">docs#is_lawful_functor</a>) and <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/category_theory.functor">docs#category_theory.functor</a></p>
<p>The first isn't really used in math as far as I am aware</p>

<p>Anyway, it’s neat to know that <code>LawfulFunctor</code> is there if I need it, so thanks!</p>
<p>Practically, if I define something as an instance of <code>LawfulFunctor</code>, can I feed it to everything that requires a <code>Functor</code>? (Still learning how classes work…part of me would expect to see an <code>extends</code> somewhere in the source, but since I don’t, I’m not really sure.)</p>

<p>The <code>LawfulFunctor</code> class is using a pattern where it takes the <code>[Functor F]</code> as an additional argument. That way the data of the functor is not actually part of the class, and it's free to be a <code>Prop</code>. A tradeoff is that to define a lawful functor you have to first define the <code>Functor</code> instance and then follow up with the <code>LawfulFunctor</code> instance.</p>

<p>Oh, I see…I would have thought it would be called <code>isLawfulFunctor</code> or something! Are there conventions in Lean for naming <code>Prop</code>s? Might it make sense to instead have <code>LawfulFunctor</code> be a typeclass that extends <code>Functor</code> with an inhabitant of <code>isLawfulFunctor</code>? Or is that bad/unnecessary/unconventional in Lean for some reason?</p>

<p>I totally agree that these prop classes should all be called <code>is_...</code>. This is apparently what's done in Isabelle and it's a very easy way to avoid confusion.</p>

<p>Convention <code>Prop</code>osal: natural-language-named prop classes should start with a present-tense third person singular verb, such as <code>Is</code>, <code>Has</code>, or a more specific one suited to the context. Linguistically, this means the type is read as a statement, and therefore interpreted as a proposition-as-type which can only sensibly be inhabited by (a proof of its own) truth—instead of a noun phrase, which we expect to be inhabited by data which <em>is</em> that noun phrase.</p>
