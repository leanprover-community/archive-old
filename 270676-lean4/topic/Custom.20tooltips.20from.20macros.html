<p>In Racket, it's convenient to have macros that associate custom tooltips with bits of syntax during expansion. This is used e.g. in Typed Racket to show the types of expressions, and for various embedded languages to report information back to users. Is there a way to do something like this in Lean 4? I could imagine exposing the information through the LSP "hover" method, for instance.</p>

<p>Could you please elaborate on the potential use cases? We already have hover with type information in our LSP server.<br>

How would the user-provided ones interact with the existing hover information?</p>

<p>Let's say I wrote a macro to generate an LALR parser automaton from a description of the grammar (Racket's is described here: <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/parser-tools/LALR_1__Parsers.html#%28form._%28%28lib._parser-tools%2Fyacc..rkt%29._parser%29%29">https://docs.racket-lang.org/parser-tools/LALR_1__Parsers.html#%28form._%28%28lib._parser-tools%2Fyacc..rkt%29._parser%29%29</a> ). It would be convenient for users to get hover information that describes things like shift-reduce conflicts, the relationship between a given operator precedence and the others in the grammar, and the like. </p>
<p>Similarly, let's say I'm porting Software Foundations and I use a macro to embed a nice syntax for one of the object languages being studied. This macro type checks the embedded terms using the object language type system. It would be nice to add hover info with those types.</p>
<p>Finally, I might want to write a client for a system with an OpenAPI spec. It would be useful to add hover information to HTTP request paths based on an IO call that my macro did. This is the "type providers" use case.</p>

<p>As far as how to interact, I'm not totally sure. One possibility is to add it and show both. Another is to replace the built in version. I'm imagining an API in an elaboration monad <code>m</code> that is something like:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">addHover</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Syntax</span> <span class="bp">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">HoverDoc</span> <span class="bp">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">m</span> <span class="n">Unit</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Where <code>HoverDoc</code> is a datatype describing things like paragraphs, type signatures, and strings.</p>

<p>And the <code>Syntax</code> is expected to be the original syntax object from the user's program</p>

<p>A seedling of an API like this <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/bf4ba1583dfe2ad9ef39540835c02b9f37686293/src/Lean/Elab/InfoTree.lean#L101">already exists</a>. It is not currently in use as we ended up not having a need for it, and as far as I remember it is not hooked up to anything in the LSP server so is not actually accessible from the editor. We might also prefer custom data in <code>Info</code> rather than in <code>InfoTree</code> directly. But what you are describing sounds like it would need such a capability to store "user data" as part of elaboration output. I think a method <code>addHover : HoverDoc → m Unit</code> would suffice since monads in the elaborator stack implement <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/bf4ba1583dfe2ad9ef39540835c02b9f37686293/src/Init/Prelude.lean#L1997"><code>MonadRef</code></a>. Probably the existing functionality closest to what you want is <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/bf4ba1583dfe2ad9ef39540835c02b9f37686293/src/Lean/Elab/Log.lean#L63"><code>logInfo</code></a>, but of course that will result in lots of squiggles in the editor whereas an on-hover info would be hidden by default.</p>

<p>I think this one is artificial. First, they don't write many programs in the object languages they study. The types in the object language often depend on a context that is not available when processing the macro. To support this correctly, I think one has to write their own elaborator for the object language. I can see scenarios where this may happen: one is implementing their own embedded DSL like @Mac's Alloy <a href="https://github.com/tydeu/lean4-alloy/blob/master/examples/my_add.lean">https://github.com/tydeu/lean4-alloy/blob/master/examples/my_add.lean</a></p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112857">@Leonardo de Moura</span> There is also some overlap with the idea of attaching more helpful information to syntax consumed by elaborators of other syntax, e.g. \cdot, that we recently discussed. For \cdot specifically, we could reuse the current <code>TermInfo</code> to attach the type as well as <code>elabBadCDot</code> as a "faux" elaborator that we can write a docstring for. However, what wasn't immediately clear to me is when and how to insert this information into the info tree such that it is still well-formed, since so far we did not have to worry about possibly-overlapping subtrees in the info tree.</p>
