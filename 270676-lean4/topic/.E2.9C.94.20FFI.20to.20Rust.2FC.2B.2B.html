<p>Amazing! Now it works!</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier in this thread, I think the goto way is to just use Rust's C FFI and avoid C++ completely.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="544752">Tage Johansson</span> Okay it works now (thanks everyone!!)<br>
The misconception I had was that I didn't think we could call Rust code <em>from C</em>. I thought it was like Lean, which allows us to call C code from it.</p>
<p>Here's the PR with the changes: <a href="https://github.com/yatima-inc/FFI.lean/pull/1">https://github.com/yatima-inc/FFI.lean/pull/1</a><br>
You might as well just fetch the <code>c</code> branch</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is btw also nothing stopping you from calling Lean code in C or C++, we have quite a few ocasions in the compiler where we do this, in general the C FFI mechanism is quite often implemented in a bidirectional way</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="544752">@Tage Johansson</span> we have found some issues with our previous template and some fixes for them. This is how we do the setup for Rust FFI now: <a href="https://github.com/yatima-inc/RustFFI.lean/commit/d8f9dbff843852a37ab2bf8794a03c00ae1fcaff">https://github.com/yatima-inc/RustFFI.lean/commit/d8f9dbff843852a37ab2bf8794a03c00ae1fcaff</a></p>
<p>In short, we were having some issues when importing a package that was setup as the previous version. Lake wouldn't know where to run <code>cargo build</code> from nor where to look for the static lib.</p>
