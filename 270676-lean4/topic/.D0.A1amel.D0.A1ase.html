<p>Were somewhere described reasons, why lean4 uses camelcase as a convention? Is looks like a strong downgrade for me, but maybe there are good reasons for that.</p>

<p>Not sure what the intended reason is, but lean4 still uses snake case for lemmas (which tend to have especially long names) and pascal case for types. Two positive properties of this are that you can more easily distinguish lemmas from types from terms, both in code and in the name of lemmas themselves, and that you tend to run into less name clashes.</p>

<p>(There are a bunch of readability studies that show both styles are perfectly fine and just make for good beer arguments :), so hard to call one a downgrade... this one I think is a well known one that found camel case better for readability: <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.180.9203&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.180.9203&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a> )</p>

<p>Fascinating stuff! I've always suspected that this issue was just CS bikeshedding...</p>
