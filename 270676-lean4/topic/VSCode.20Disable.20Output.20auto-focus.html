<p>Is there a way to prevent the Lean 4 VSCode extension from auto-focusing the Output pane whenever a new message is printed? I am frequently being tripped up by this behavior as it rips me away from my Integrated Terminal session to show me new log messages (e.g., RPC sessions closures), which can be frustrating.</p>

<p>There are a lot of GitHub issues about this since there's no option to disable this, but the VSCode team seems to redirect people to the extension developers. Apparently one should set <code>LanguageClientOptions.revealOutputChannelOn</code> to <code>Never</code> and/or call <code>OutputChannel.show</code> with <code>preserveFocus: true</code>, but the second one is already done in the Lean VSCode extension (as far as I can tell) and I just tried the first suggestion, but it doesn't seem to change anything.</p>

<p>There is one case where this will still interrupt me - when I have another the Terminal tab open in a pane that also contains Output. For that, you can put them side-by-side within the pane so that the Output is always visible. It's not ideal. Basically the reason why Output is shown is so that users know rather than have to guess if something failed. We could show a message box instead, but that might be even more annoying</p>

<p>I think the idea is that popping up the output window is much more disruptive to the layout of your editor  and the output tab steals the space from the Terminal tab and so on, whereas a message box simply pops on top which is much easier to ignore and close.</p>

<p>This may be a matter of personal preference.  I find the message boxes to be much more disruptive since I have to manually close them, while I can just ignore the output.  The three message boxes about failing LSP requests drive me nuts every time the server crashes.</p>

<p>I realize that there may have been some confusion here, because there are multiple kinds of errors and they have different behavior (describing the state before <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/vscode-lean4/pull/229">vscode-lean4#229</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>LSP errors: shown as message box, written to output, but not focused (this is the vscode-languageserver's doing)</li>

<li>Lean version info: written to output on startup but not focused</li>

<p>I'd like to change the default of the <code>lean4.autofocusOutput</code> option to true; panics should be shown by default. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I very much do not like this. In my view, UI panes should not be automatically toggling themselves unless I specifically ask them to. Furthermore, most panics from the Lean core and imported libraries (the most common sources, I feel) can't be solved by the user anyway, so having the window pop-up to inform them of this is kind of irrelevant. Finally, auto-showing the Output panel under any circumstances is extremely disruptive, as it can steal focus from e.g., the user typing the Integrated Terminal causing major headaches.</p>
<p>Also, while I admire the attempt to solve all the error messages that emerge. Such appears with relative frequency as both LSP server and extension are updated with new features. Having the extremely disruptive Output panel pop-up to inform users of errors they cannot solve themselves and have to wait until some fix to prevent the disruption seems like bad UX.</p>
<p>If the only reason why the Output panel is auto-shown is to display panics, maybe it would be a better idea to capture messages that begin with "PANIC!" and display them as error boxes instead (and leave the Output panel in its current non-auto-show state).</p>

<p>I think the new behavior is reasonable, because outside of debugging the server oneself, most users can not do anything with the information from the stderr, so there is little to no point for them to be presented with it by default.</p>

<p>They can't be solved, but they should be <em>reported</em>.  It's very much relevant to show them.</p>

<p>The stderr information is almost never from the server (the last two weeks are pretty much the exception, sorry for that).  The usual information that's printed on stderr are panics, which you need to address as a user.</p>

<p>I'm kind of in the opposite boat, since I don't use the integrated terminal at all.  Message boxes are much more disruptive to me since they pile up and I need to dismiss them manually, while I can just ignore the output panel.  The integrated terminal problem lies partially with vscode.  Wojciech writes above that:</p>

<p>This has not much been my experience. Every time I have encounter the serving reporting a panic, it is due to some weird server edge case (i.e., a partial input that broke something probably)that I have no way of diagnosing or even understanding what caused it. As such, I just continue on as normal and things general continue to work. Showing the panics is to me is just distracting.</p>

<p>If I am in the middle of some project I am not going to go bother to do that (and disrupting a user's work flow as means to get users to report Lean bugs seems like bad etiquette). The good news, I guess, is that I have had a panic reported in a while so whatever bugs there were likely got fixed.</p>

<p>Looking at the discussion above, there exist differing preferences for message boxes vs. output panel.  We should keep the autofocusOutput option, but also show message boxes on stderr output when it is disabled.</p>
<p>The only question is about the default value.  I'm gonna wait a bit and see if anybody else has strong preferences on output panel vs. message boxes.</p>

<p>I am using VSCode 1.69.2 and yes I still encountered this (until, of course, v0.0.88 and ceasing of the auto-showing of the Output panel). I do not know what a repro here would look like. If I type in the Terminal and error message is logged to the Output panel, it switches to it and breaks up my input, which is extremely annoying. Because I then have to click on the Terminal (because I don't use keyboard shortcuts for navigation) to go back to typing (which can be quickly disrupted if, like the server has been doing these pasts weeks, more errors come).</p>

<p>(Looks at the goal view...) It bugs me that Ctrl-shift-enter isn't a toggle; when I open a lean file the goal view leaps out of its own volition and I have to use the mouse to get rid of it.</p>

<p>I prefer message boxes to the output panel. Especially if something is triggering lots of error messages, the auto-focus can literally prevent me from getting to the terminal to stop the fire</p>

<p>Another possibility, not always applicable, is to use diagnostics though. I think this has a much better user experience and seems appropriate for things like explicit <code>panic!</code> calls</p>

<li>The <code>autofocusOutput</code> setting default remains <code>false</code>.  A surprising number of people use the integrated terminal and it doesn't work well with autofocus, so that's the safer out-of-the-box option.</li>
<li>However stderr messages produce an error message box now, with a button to open the output panel.</li>
<li>To balance it out, we don't show error messages for LSP request errors (they still go to the output panel though).</li>
<li>I've also changed ctrl-shift-enter to be a toggle as requested by Mario.</li>
