<p>The macOS binary is missing from <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4-nightly/releases/tag/nightly-2021-02-12">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4-nightly/releases/tag/nightly-2021-02-12</a></p>
<p>Out of curiosity I took a look at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/runs/1883800966?check_suite_focus=true">the macOS job log</a> that should have generated this. For some reason the "Prepare Nightly release" and "Release Nightly" steps were skipped. Could something be going wrong in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/actions/runs/559535951/workflow#L104">this line of the workflow config</a>?</p>

<p>Ah, there seems to be a race condition, where one of the other jobs might push the tag to nightly before the others start on this step. I think it's correct to skip the "Prepare Nightly Release" if that tag has already been pushed, but I think you would still want to run the "Release Nightly" step. I'm not sure of the best way of ensuring this, maybe through another environment variable?</p>

<p>Thanks, this should be fixed with <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/commit/5db8073c32e580eb4c7669ccf2dcf7b0c95de1c9">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/commit/5db8073c32e580eb4c7669ccf2dcf7b0c95de1c9</a>... hopefully</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span> Thanks! But it seems there's a missing semicolon or something breaking the script: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/runs/1890427489#step:8:26">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/runs/1890427489#step:8:26</a></p>

<p>Ah, it's well-known that it's impossible to write a Bash script the correct way on the first try</p>
