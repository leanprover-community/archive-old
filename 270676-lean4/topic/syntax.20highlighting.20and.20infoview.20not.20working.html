<p>I am having issues with syntax highlighting and the infoview not updating. It just gets stuck, and does not react to me changing the file. It updates again if I restart vscode, but then quickly goes back to not working. I have been restarting vscode every 5 minutes or so for the past hour. This just started today. Is there anything that could be causing this? What should I do to try to debug the issue?</p>

<p>Update: I have determined that the problem is just in one theorem. I suspect the issue is that I am using aesop in the theorem and it came up with a monster proof. Then whenever I edit the theorem, it runs again, and slows everything down. Does this sound plausible?</p>

<p>Very possible. You can call <code>aesop?</code> to have it print the tactic proof, or <code>set_option trace.aesop.proof in aesop</code> to print the proof term, or <code>set_option trace.aesop.steps in aesop</code> to print the steps Aesop took. (The last one usually produces a lot of output.) If Aesop is slower than you'd expect given your rule set, I'd be happy to investigate.</p>

<p>Yeah, I replaced it with the tactic proof, and that fixed it. Thanks!</p>
