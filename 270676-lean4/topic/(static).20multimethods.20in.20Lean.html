<p>I recently got to know that Julia supports multi-methods (multi dispatch as opposed to a single dispatch common in OO languages) and it is used as a cleaner, more powerful way to solve the expression problem. Julia does this at runtime, although other than development I wouldnt want/need that in production.</p>
<p>Could the same be achieved statically in Lean4 with multi-parameter type classes?</p>

<p>Definitely! For example, mathlib has a "scalar multiplication" operator <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/has_scalar.smul">docs#has_scalar.smul</a> that dispatches on the left and right side of the multiplication simultaneously.</p>
