<p>How much is <code>lean4</code> going to be equipped for general-purpose programming?</p>

<p>I suspect it depends on people developing libraries for it</p>

<p>We can compile to C right now, in the future we might be able to compile to both LLVM and web assembly as well. We also certainly have the performance and FFI capabilities to get at least close to other popular general purpose FP languages, it just depends on how many people jump in as Arthur said.</p>

<p>In the company I work at, Clojure is de default language for backend dev. So functional programming languages can definitely have their place in the industry as well.</p>

<p>Hehe, idk. It could be cool, but also requires a lot of maturity of the language, but all the components are there. So I could make an app or compile to wasm once I get emscripten to compile leancpp.</p>

<p>Also right now it is very imperative and I would like to build something more compositional and dependently typed on top of it.</p>

<p>I've been doing gamedev in Godot for almost 2 years and the use of dependent types in gamedev is not clear to me. Do you have a concrete use case in mind?</p>
<p>On this topic, I thought about making a Lean plugin for Godot. Godot provides its own language, called "GDScript", but it can also accept other languages like Python, Lua, C# and whatever else we build the support for</p>

<p>Can lean somehow integrate with Simon Tatham's puzzle games? This is a very well-designed collection of single player games with a well-documented API for which one could write algorithms and proofs that the algorithms work.</p>

<p>Yes, I see they are using wasm as well. When we get wasm support in Lean we can do something similar. Lean can integrate with most c libraries or compiled code, but requires glue code.</p>
