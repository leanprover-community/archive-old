<p>I can see no error message at all, I already tried to delete the build and lean_package directories etc. but nothing changed so I fixed the things using <code>lake build</code> + vim in the hopes that it will disappear after the build works again but nope, I'm still stuck in this state. What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>This is very weird because there were no changes to the bundled Lake between the Lean version on main (06-24) and 06-30.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="395550">@Henrik Böving</span> Yep, I was able to reproduce the segfault. I think the problem is clash between the Lake version distributed with Lean and the one you are depending on. You need to depend on the Lake version of your Lean version (i.e., <code>401e738e4ca989ced8d9bb0cf7f66be9133fc435</code> / <code>tsyntax</code>).</p>

<p>If we could narrow down the source of the problem though, that might help me figure out what it is and fix it. A <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mwe.html">#mwe</a> would be quite helpful -- doc-gen4 is a big project with a lot of dependencies and many moving parts which make it hard to debug what part of the build system is failing (and if that is even the source of the problem).</p>

<p>One of the problems I did have when inspected doc-gen4 was that I got a n error saying that the <code>Lake.olean</code>  object file did not exists. This one I do know the cause of and it was already fixed (hopefully) in v3.2.0. The problem is the Lake would use the workspace's Lake module to evaluate the lakefile rather than the builtin one. For instance, it would use the Lake required by doc-gen4 rather than the Lake in the toolchain, which could cause all kinds of errors. That may also be the source of your editor woes, but I am not sure (since your error looks different).</p>

<p>It also uses <code>findSysroot</code> rather than just using the sysroot of the Lean found by Lake(i.e., <code>lean.sysroot</code>) which is a bit weird.</p>

<p>More generally, there is no reason to initialize the search path in doc-gen4 anyway since you call out to <code>Lake.loadWorkspace</code> which already initializes the search path itself.</p>

<p>The main reason I started using Lake as a library instead of calling to it as a foreign binary was that I wanted to add the links to the source of the libraries which required me to interact with the Lake project structure in order to figure out the remote urls (here: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/doc-gen4/blob/main/DocGen4/Output/SourceLinker.lean">https://github.com/leanprover/doc-gen4/blob/main/DocGen4/Output/SourceLinker.lean</a>). If I could somehow get this information without depending on <code>Lake.loadWorkspace</code> to give me the workspace I can fetch this information from I would gladly avoid pulling in Lake as yet another dependency.</p>
<p>I'll remove the initSearchPath then, thank you^^</p>

<p>to figure out the remote urls</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One super low-tech, hacky way to do this without Lake would be to just iterate over the directories in <code>lean_packages</code> and capture the output of <code>git remote get-url origin</code>. However, using Lake for this is probably a more principled solution. On the other hand, it may be worth it to create some Lake CLI command (ala <code>print-paths</code>) that outputs a JSON blob containing the information you want from Lake.</p>

<p>True, that does seem to contain almost the informations I need. There is one thing missing though, in my source linker I perform this check: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/doc-gen4/blob/main/DocGen4/Output/SourceLinker.lean#L78">https://github.com/leanprover/doc-gen4/blob/main/DocGen4/Output/SourceLinker.lean#L78</a> which attempts to find which lake package a certain module came from in order to use the correct remote URL, that's missing still.</p>

<p>Also if i end up parsing this JSON I have an other more general question: Both with LeanInk and Lake I would end up parsing some JSON files. This is just some data stuff but I'd hate to replicate the code from both other libraries to doc-gen which is also the reson it is pulling in LeanInk as a foreign library right now (the actual LeanInk work is done by a real LeanInk binary). Do we have some nice solution to this idea of just importing the data representation of something? Maybe splitting up libraries?</p>

<p>You only really pay for the <code>import</code>s you actually use from a dependency, so moving those data structures into separate modules should be sufficient I think</p>

<p>I just realized gave you bad advice here. Lake does initialize the search path itself. However, it does not initialize it with the workspace's olean directories, which is what you want. So you do need to initialize the search path yourself.  Using <code>initSearchPath</code>, though can lead to the problem I mentioned (prioritizing user modules over built-in ones) so you will need to rolll your own like so:</p>

<p>Regarding this, I also have another idea that lake might be able to address. In doc-gen4 and by now also in other projects my include_str macro for statically reading a file at compile time into a static Lean string has spread. But the issue to this day remains that the Lean compiler has of course no clue that this file is part of its dependency chain and thus the lean files that include it should be rebuilt. Could we maybe have some mechanism to explicitly add nodes to the dependency graph? So in this case e.g. tell Lake that if style.css is more recently touched than StaticStrings.lean rebuild StaticStrings.lean?....although at this point we are basically a full blown make :D<br>
How about a <code>lake graph &lt;mods&gt;</code> that prints out all the information about the dependency graph of mods (package, imports, source file, olean file, ilean file, etc.). Does that sound like a generally useful tool?</p>

<p>It does work if I put this code inside a <code>target rubiksTarget (pkg : Package) : FilePath</code>, but then I no longer have a single and reusable <code>tsxTarget</code> which is polymorphic over the <code>tsxName : Name</code> of the file to build. I think the reason why <code>target rubiksTarget</code> works is thanks to the custom elaborator which inserts the right value for <code>pkg</code> that makes the <code>fetch</code> open family give the right type. This brings me to, not to bash your work as overall Lake is great, but I'm sorry to say I think the open family API is a mistake. It uses really advanced language features in a user-facing part of a build system, and it's guaranteed to cause lots of confusion, as well as errors like the one we see above. The API in Lake 3 wherein we simply got a <code>BuildTarget FilePath</code> (or whatever wrapper around a <em>concrete</em> type <code>FilePath</code>) out of the plain <code>def</code> created by <code>target packageLock</code> was easier to use.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The problem with this is that API was broken. It was not (and could not be) properly integrated with the build store so the same target could end up being rebuilt multiple times (and separate builds could race with each other). It only worked in its very limited application because the targets being used (e.g., <code>extern_lib</code>, <code>extraDepTarget</code>) were not meant to depend on each other. </p>
<p>However, in your case, you were already violating this assumption. So, if the library was building multiple TSX targets at once, it would attempt to build <code>packageLock</code> multiple times simultaneously, which could cause problems. Even if bugs did not emerge, such rebuilds also are performance hits.</p>

<p>It should be noted that custom targets are not really meant to be a novice user-facing part of the system. After all, writing them requires looking into Lake's source code and understanding the internal Build API (or, previously, the Target API). It is meant for advanced users who want as much power as they can get.</p>

<p>You are mostly correct, the problem with your general solution is that it does not necessarily ensure that the <code>pkg</code> is the right package, which the <code>target</code> does ensure. You can however replicate this by mirroring the <code>target</code>'s function signature. That is, add a <code>[Fact (pkg.name = _package.name)]</code> argument to <code>tsxTarget</code>.</p>

<p>Fyi, in case you are curious as to why you need to do this. The problem is rather straightforward: the target in question (e.g., <code>packageLock</code>) is only available on package you are defining, not other packages (e.g., dependencies, dependents) -- thus you need to ensure the package being passed to <code>tsxTarget</code> is the current package, not some other package (and this is what the <code>Fact</code> does).</p>

<p>Let me push back a bit on this. Being able to write down a few commands and state "these produce file <code>foo</code>", then another few commands and state "these produce <code>bar</code> but make sure <code>foo</code> is built first" is <strong>the most basic</strong> functionality of a build system. This is trivial to do in Make and it should be easy in Lake. All the nice features for auto-building Lean modules, shared libraries and so on are conceptually sugar on top of this. I totally understand that there are engineering constraints such as the target duplication you mention that can make (hah) a good balance difficult to achieve, but I think we should err on the side of simplicity.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>So to ensure that the <code>pkg</code> argument I get is my package, I need to synthesize a propositional equation through typeclass inference so that more typeclass inference can use a value-indexed dependent type family to synthesize the right type for the path of my file? I'm sorry, I just think this is way too complicated. Setting up a build script for a project is often the first step one takes in trying out a new language, and it is easy to get discouraged - I know I have. I don't think doing this should require a PhD in type theory.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I understand, thank you for explaining. My point is mostly about the mechanism by which this is ensured.</p>
<p>So far this was not very constructive. I don't understand the internals enough to really propose something, but perhaps:</p>
<ul>
<li>could we have a global <code>__package__</code>, like the global <code>__dir__</code>? There is some disconnect in that the latter is global, whereas the former is given as an argument.</li>
<li>whatever the API, could we hide the name-indexing families as an implementation detail and keep only concrete <code>Type</code>s (of course modulo monadic wrappers which are unavoidable) in the user-facing API? Hopefully I highlighted above why simplicity seems important to me here.</li>
</ul>
<p>And let me say again -- thank you for all your work spent on Lake! It really does work very well, and was clearly a lot of effort. It is just this one corner I am complaining about :)</p>

<p>No, this is impossible, because the <code>Package</code> object can only be constructed after the whole Lakefile is elaborate (and dependencies are resolved, etc.).

<p>This is specifically what <code>target</code> is intended to do, hide the ugliness.. You broke this by defining a separate <code>def</code> (such parameterization is non-trivial even in make).

<p>I agree. However, the arbitrary build system portion of Lake was not initially its primary purpose, and is essentially a new feature implemented this summer.

<p>In fact, as originally designed, the arbitrary build support was largely a hack to support a few specific use cases -- the building Lean modules was the core system. It is only with the Lake v4 overhaul that building Lean modules are really a convivence layer on top of the arbitrary builds.</p>

<p>I am not sure I agree with this framing. Most arbitrary build systems are not what I call easy-to-use for beginners (Rake, CMake, Make, Shake, etc.). Generally, there is a simple default template beginners use and then very complicate build magic that experts use. Just look at Lean's CMake configuration -- not something I think a beginner would ever be able to comprehend.</p>
<p>Now, I don't think this is necessarily good, so I would very much like to make Lake as user-friendly as possible. But, I do not think arbitrary build scripts are generally meant for beginners, that is what the pretty declarative library and executable configurations are for. The build scripts are meant to be written by users with a strong grasp of Lean who need specific build magic on their unique project (like you do, with the complicated magic of widgets).</p>

<p>Yes, your particular case can be done concisely in Make because of its <code>%</code> magic for file names. However, were the input and output file names not directly related in this manner, parameterization would not be so easy. Which is kind of my point, build systems generally introduce some magic to make common applications easier, but once you leave these bounds, things start getting very complex.</p>

<p>I am still surprised you figured out how to get it working with the old API. The <code>.target</code> part of a target was not documented (and was not really meant to be used the way you did), so you kind of lucked into a solution.

<p>Could we replace (at least in the user-facing API) <code>fetch</code> with something like <code>buildTargetOn (t : TargetDecl a) (pkg : Package) : M a</code> which works in a plain <code>def</code> as well as in a <code>target</code>? Note that this requires indexing <code>TargetDecl</code> by the output type, but it drops the name-indexed state injected by <code>target</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that <code>fetch</code> is not just used for fetching custom package targets,, so this would not be a replacement.  </p>
<p>To the main question, sadly, no, for multiple reasons. First, <code>TargetDecl</code> is specifically designed not to be parameterized by type (because it needs to be loaded via <code>evalConstCheck</code> in the package loader). Second, the package still needs to be verified to be the right one (because that is how the result type in the build store is determined).</p>
<p>It is possible to do what you want via a runtime check and a per-target projection (which could be generated by the <code>target</code> macro). For example,</p>

<p>Okay, I have been thinking a little about this. I would say parametric targets would already make everything much easier. The other thing I am still hung up on is the mysterious signature of <code>fetch</code> whose output type depends on a separate declaration and is only synthesized through typeclass inference. It seems like the root cause is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, <code>TargetDecl</code> is specifically designed not to be parameterized by type (because it needs to be loaded via evalConstCheck in the package loader). Second, the package still needs to be verified to be the right one (because that is how the result type in the build store is determined).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could you say a bit more about why the <code>evalConst</code> is necessary? Could we have a typed wrapper around <code>TargetDecl</code> which is not itself <code>evalConst</code>-able but which keeps the target's output type around? It seems to me that having <code>target abc : Foo</code> generate a <code>TTargetDecl Foo</code>, or <code>TTargetDecl Foo `thisPkg</code> would be exactly the thing we'd need to simplify <code>fetch</code> into something like <code>def fetch (pkg : TPackage `thisPkg) (tgt : TargetDecl Foo `thisPkg) : IndexBuildM Foo</code>. (Note: It seems <code>TPackage</code> might also be a good idea, so I was already assuming it here.)</p>

<p>I very much don't like this. If a <code>Package</code> configuration is successfully loaded its builds should be well-formed (unless the user did something evil). The point of a strongly typed language is to avoid such dynamic checking runtime errors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Come to think of this, is it even possible to load another package's <code>lakefile</code>? Suppose that in any given <code>lakefile</code>, the <code>(pkg : Package)</code> part of a <code>target</code> <em>could not possibly</em> refer to anything other than the current package. Then making that a privileged special case would be quite natural, and a runtime failure would be impossible. (It would also avoid the <code>TPackage</code>/<code>TTargetDecl</code> from my post above.)</p>

<p>Of course, this is what <code>require</code> does. You can also build targets from dependencies (and even dependents) in local packages (for example, one might wish to build the <code>docs</code> facet contributed by doc-gen4).</p>

<p>Because that is how Lake loads targets from configuration files. It loads <code>TargetDecl</code> defs marked <code>@[target]</code> from the configuration environment using <code>evalConstCheck</code>. I imagine widgets do something similar with their <code>widget</code> declarations.</p>

<p>One reason why Packages have not already been refactored to include the name in the type, is that there are many places in the Lake codebase where this is not desirable, so this would introduce back and forth coercions in a number of places.</p>

<p>I had a much simpler idea. I can see that transferring bundled data of arbitrary type between build jobs is tricky. What would entirely suffice here instead is if I could tell Lake "You know that other <code>FilePath</code> you know how to build? Please make sure  it's built first before building this other one, i.e. please make it a dependency of the other". It would need to support substituting both "the current target when we're in <code>IndexBuildM</code>" as well as "some target that Lake defines implicitly, as in a specific <code>.olean</code>" for "this other one". This would also basically solve the part of <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lake/pull/86">lake#86</a> that doesn't depend on custom elaborators communicating data to Lake.</p>
