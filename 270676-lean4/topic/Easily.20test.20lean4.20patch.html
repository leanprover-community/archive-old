<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>I'm making some patches to lean4, which I would like to test against existing codebases by swapping out <code>lean-toolchain</code> with a reference to a github release, or, better yet, commit hash in a fork. How would I go about it?</p>
<p>It seems to be attempting to download from a very peculiar place: <a href="https://github.com/cognivore/lean4/releases/expanded_assets/alt-backend">https://github.com/cognivore/lean4/releases/expanded_assets/alt-backend</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, I don't quite understand if I need to provide it with binary releases or is it possible to have <code>lake</code> call <code>elan</code> to compile <code>lean</code> somehow. Sorry for silly questions, I'll read the code of the corresponding tools, but perhaps someone knows off the bat how to develop in a fork.</p>

<p>Alright, things still don't work.</p>
<p>I made a release of some branch, which caused some job to run successfully <a href="https://github.com/cognivore/lean4/actions/runs/3754045206">https://github.com/cognivore/lean4/actions/runs/3754045206</a></p>
<p>However, when I go to <code>releases</code> section in the repository and find the release made for this branch, I don't see any files generated: <a href="https://github.com/cognivore/lean4/releases/tag/carboncopy-1-2-1">https://github.com/cognivore/lean4/releases/tag/carboncopy-1-2-1</a></p>

<p>Hmm, it only ran the "Nix CI" workflow but not the "CI" workflow.  The "CI" workflow is the one which uploads the releases.</p>
