<p>Hello,<br>
I'm sure this question has been asked before but I can't find an answer.</p>
<p>Would you advise a beginner to use lean 3 or lean 4?<br>
Thanks</p>

<p>That depends on your topic of interest. Are you a computer scientists that wants to do functional programming and a bit of proving? Or are you a mathematician that is exclusively interested in proving.</p>
<p>If you fall in the first category definitely Lean 4. If you fall in the second category Lean 3 is probably the better choice due to the already available mathlib with tons of formalized mathematics already done for you. There is however ongoing work to port it to Lean 4 and sooner or later everyone will switch to Lean 4 so if you're content with not doing too advanced things for now you can also stay with Lean 4 already while the team is busy porting.</p>

<p>It is mainly for doing algorithm proofs or verifying implementations and doing math.</p>
<p>I program mainly in C and I do not intend to write my programs in lean.</p>

<p>doing algorithm proofs in lean generally involves writing the code in lean, since you can't prove properties about an extern function</p>

<p>Yes I know.<br>
I mean my final code will be written in another language but I will use lean to verify that the math and logic of my algorithms are correct.</p>

<p>It will only be a few months until mathlib has been ported to Lean 4 and then Lean 3 will be end of life.</p>

<p>Oh, great, good to know.</p>
<p>I'm in a similar situation and want to start learning now. I'm comfortable with Haskell other standard programming languages so getting used to that side of things will not be an issue.</p>
<p>But I intend to use Lean for mathematics, mostly for logic, basic category theory, and a study of relational structures. Would you say that that part of Lean 4 is ready already?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="573474">@Tomáš Jakl</span> I think it's <em>almost ready</em>. In a couple of weeks, those basics should be ported.</p>
