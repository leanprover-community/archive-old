<p>There is an annoyance in Lean 3, that nat multiplication <code>n * p</code> is defined by induction on the right variable <code>p</code>. This is an annoyance because a general monoid has an <code>ℕ</code>-module instance, where <code>n • x</code> is defined by induction on <code>n</code>, so on <code>ℕ</code> we get two <code>ℕ</code>-modules instance (the one for a general monoid, and the other one from the fact that any monoid is a module over itself) for which the multiplications are not defeq. And having two instances that are not defeq is something that we should avoid as much as possible. (For now, it means that we have to jump through hoops sometimes). The problem would disappear if nat multiplication were defined by induction on the left variable.</p>
<p>Lean 4 multiplication is defined in the same way by induction on the right variable <code>p</code>, see <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/597304db959b5d1fb69d10d2a15d405f637d19f6/src/Init/Prelude.lean#L481">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/597304db959b5d1fb69d10d2a15d405f637d19f6/src/Init/Prelude.lean#L481</a>. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span> ,  would you consider a PR changing this to induction on the left-variable if it doesn't create problems elsewhere? (I'll perfectly understand if the answer is no, but if the answer can be yes then the sooner the change is made, the better, as it means fewer fixes down the road).</p>

<p>When you say "diamond", I guess you mean two instances that are not defeq, right? Changing the definition of multiplication on nat should fix it, as you would use literally the same definition in the two instances, no?</p>

<p>I think this is a result of the fact that Lean's Nat is based off the Peano naturals, whose multiplication operation is defined by induction on the right variable. So there is tension between the monoid definition and Peano definition.</p>

<p>In the Peano naturals, you can define multiplication by induction on the right variable or on the left variable, as you prefer. In mathematical practice, we often write <code>n + 1</code>, <code>n + 2</code>, and so on (much more often than <code>1 + n</code>, <code>2 + n</code> and so on), but on the other hand we often write <code>1 * n</code>, <code>2 * n</code>, <code>3 * n</code> and so on (much more often than <code>n * 1</code>, <code>n * 2</code>, <code>n * 3</code> and so on), so in everyday practice there is a funny asymmetry between addition and multiplication. If Lean 4 could reflect this everyday practice in its definition of addition and multiplication, this would be nice (for defeq purposes with small numbers, and for defeqness of the natural monoid addition), but it's not a big deal in any case.</p>

<p>If it only solves one diamond (and it does) and if it is more natural from the mathematical point of view (and it is), then it is a net improvement over the situation we have, although not a big one I agree. But this discussion is moot for Lean 4 while we haven't tried it on Lean 3.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>True, you <strong>could</strong>. You could also flip the module definition. My point was simply that the standard formulation of the Peano axioms uses induction on the right variable. Thus, if the nat multiplication uses induction on the left variable it would no longer be defeq to the Peano naturals. So changing it would create a similar problem elsewhere. This happened to be particularly notable to me, since I am currently  doing some proof work in Lean using Peano logic.</p>

<p>I don't care about any "standard" definition of the Peano naturals, clearly both definitions work and satisfy the same theorems. This is an implementation issue and history doesn't help with this -- for all we know Peano just chose randomly. I think Sebastién has a valid point and it's worth experimenting.

<p>Finally we have tried the other nat (and int) multiplication in Lean 3. By "we", I mean <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="308899">@Yakov Pechersky</span> , who's fixed everything in Lean core <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/issues/551">lean#551</a>, and then in mathlib <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/6773">#6773</a>. Thanks a lot for this!</p>
<p>To recap: currently, in Lean 3, nat addition <code>x + y</code> is defined by induction on <code>y</code> (so that <code>x + 0 = x</code> is definitional), and nat multiplication also (so that <code>x * 1 = x</code> is definitional -- well, this is not true but it could be true with a little tweak of the definition). This creates a few problems down the road, where we say that any type with <code>0</code> and <code>+</code> has a nat action <code>n • x</code> defined by induction on <code>n</code>, and this gives two different actions of nat on itself, where multiplication is defined by induction on the first variable in one case, on the second variable in the other case.</p>
<p>The PR redefines nat multiplication to be by induction on the first variable (but addition remains an induction on the second variable). With this, our diamond problem disappears, and also <code>1 * n = n</code> becomes definitional, which is nice because in maths we write much more often <code>1 * n</code> or <code>2 * n</code> than <code>n * 1</code> or <code>n * 2</code>, for cultural reasons or whatever.  And also for int, in the same way. Also, the new definition is given by hand with <code>nat.rec_on</code> instead of using the equation compiler because the term produced by the equation compiler is a little bit messy.</p>
<p>If I understand correctly, the refactor broke a few proofs that were probably relying too much on defeqness of multiplication, so resulting in more robust proofs. A more serious issue is with a technique converting automatically proofs from addition to multiplication or vice versa, through the <code>additive</code> or <code>multiplicative</code> type synonyms. Some of these proofs broke, because the definition of addition and multiplication are now different. I am not sure it matters a lot because this <code>additive</code> and <code>multiplicative</code> stuff is more or less a hack, and it is not clear how it will work in Lean 4 (there is another thread on this, I am not sure we came to a conclusion about this).</p>
<p>For me, the pros of the change outweigh the cons, and by a rather big margin. I'd be curious to hear what others think. Of course, in the end, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112857">@Leonardo de Moura</span> has the final call on what he does in Lean 4, and I think we will merge <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="308899">@Yakov Pechersky</span> 's refactor if and only if Leo decides that changing the definition of nat and int multiplication is a good move for Lean 4. (With heterogeneous multiplication in Lean 4 it would be even easier to do it uniformly).</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="308899">@Yakov Pechersky</span> , maybe you want to comment more on how the refactor did go?</p>

<p>The motivating example <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110050">@Sebastien Gouezel</span>  wanted to work was</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">algebra.module.basic</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>which is now true for this branch.</p>
<p>Regarding the refactor, it was almost entirely having to rephrase proofs that relied on <code>n * m.succ</code> being defeq to <code>n * m + m.succ</code> or proofs that relied on coercions being automatically applied to a particular level. More work was necessary to rephrase the <code>additive/multiplicative</code> proofs -- I was inspired by some of the formalization tooling <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110043">@Gabriel Ebner</span> has in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/6045">#6045</a>. I definitely got a large appreciation for proofs that rely on rewriting instead of "deep-rfl". The "deep-rfl" are the most brittle to such a refactor, particularly the ones that are used in a proof that is not part of the "foundational" API.</p>
<p>I think that this refactor would change what some users are familiar with in terms of which terms are defeq and what "cute" proof-terminating strategies one can use. But I think in general it can help unify the "nat"-action and "int"-action with regular nat-mul and int-mul. I did not do any of that sort of refactoring other than now utilizing those facts (rewriting, not defeq) and providing the instance test example above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A more serious issue is with a technique converting automatically proofs from addition to multiplication or vice versa, through the <code>additive</code> or <code>multiplicative</code> type synonyms. Some of these proofs broke, because the definition of addition and multiplication are now different.</p>

<p>where the old proof was <code>rfl</code>, but the new proof is not. Maybe changing the definition of the power function could also fix this.</p>
