<p>First of all, I come here from a place of ignorance trying to get some bearings. And so general thoughts or "directions" is already more than I am looking for!</p>
<p>It seems that e-graphs has regained some attention these past few years as an (more) efficient data structure for equality saturation and I can't stop wondering how is it related to tabled resolution being used in Lean4.</p>
<p>Are they basically different solutions to the same problem? Or are they at some level complimentary in the e-graphs could be used to improve space or time performance of tabled resolution?</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
