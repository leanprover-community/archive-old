<p>there is an <code>application type mismatch</code> but tactic state says <code>goals accomplished</code></p>

<p>Yeah I guess the Lean4 extension isn't as polished as Lean3, so don't necessarily trust it if it says goals accomplished, make sure there aren't any other errors.</p>

<p>I would note that, in a manner of speaking, the goal was accomplished, <code>f f</code> does  technically have type <code>Nat</code>, thus it completes the goal. The problem is simply that <code>f f</code> is invalid, hence the other error.  So this might be considered the expected behavior</p>

<p>But it's not even just related to being type correct. e.g. put this in a blank Lean4 file:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">example</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="bp">∀</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Nat</span><span class="o">),</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="bp">+</span> <span class="n">m</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">m</span> <span class="bp">+</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="kd">by</span>
  <span class="n">intros</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="n">m</span>
  <span class="n">apply</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>for me it says "goals accomplished" even though it's an invalid thing and it shows a squiggly red line "unexpected end of input" as it should.</p>
