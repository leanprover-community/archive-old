<p>How much of the lean compiler can I reuse in a Lean program?  Like, suppose I want to open a file from disk, run it through lean, and get:</p>
<ul>
<li>the list of lines</li>
<li>the list of error messages and their associated row:col ranges</li>
<li>a structured representation of the document where I have nodes for each namespace, section, command, etc, and where I can walk the AST and get source ranges for each node</li>
</ul>
<p>Is this mostly straightforward by using the right stdlib functions, or do I have to rewrite some of it myself?</p>
<p>(I'm getting sufficiently tired of minimizing examples by hand that I'd like to start porting my Coq bug minimizer to Lean for auto-minimizing test cases.)</p>

<p>Yes, this is absolutely possible and how the language server works. The server is a bit complicated by asynchronicity etc, so it's probably better to look at the noninteractive top level function: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/54405c4543dab3d3c537d0c26965e186e9ce42c4/src/Lean/Elab/Frontend.lean#L92-L99">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/54405c4543dab3d3c537d0c26965e186e9ce42c4/src/Lean/Elab/Frontend.lean#L92-L99</a><br>
You can see how it prints the error messages, and <code>s.commands : Array Syntax</code> gives you access to the file's concrete syntax tree</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
