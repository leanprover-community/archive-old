<p>On nightly-2021-08-29, this fails:<br>
<code>theorem f (l0 : Σ α, List α) (h : (l : Σ α, List α) → True) : True := h l0</code><br>
It fails because  lean assigns a different universe to α in  l0 and h.<br>
But if I change that theorem into a def it works:<br>
<code>def f (l0 : Σ α, List α) (h : (l : Σ α, List α) → True) : True := h l0</code><br>
It succeeds because lean assigns the same universe to both (my guess is that some universe inference must be happening).<br>
I don't really know whether universe inference is desirable here, but what I really don't understand is why the behavior depends on if I use <code>theorem/def</code> keyword. <code>theorem</code> actually seems more flexible as it doesn't have to generate code... Is it a bug, or do I misunderstand something?</p>

<p>In Lean 3 the type of a <code>def</code> is inferred taking the body of the definition into account, while the type of a <code>theorem</code> is not. Don't know if it is the same in Lean 4, but it looks like it.</p>

<p>Thanks, I think you're right... If I sorry the  def and hover on the alphas they are in different universes</p>
