<h1>Term goal and local context query request server protocol extension proposal (Pre-RFC)</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Tactic proofs are easy to follow because you can step through them line by line and watch how the tactic state changes.  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/pull/275">Lean 3.15 therefore extended this feature to term-mode proofs.</a> With this change, Lean also shows for every subterm a tactic state, printing the local context and the expected type.</p>
<p>This feature makes it easy to understand term-mode proofs since you can now step through them just like a tactic proof.  It is also useful when reading code, since it tells you the names and types of local variables.</p>
<h2>Proposal</h2>
<p>In analogy to the <code>$/lean/plainGoal</code> request, we add a <code>$/lean/plainTermGoal</code> request, returning a pretty-printed goal state consisting of the local context and the expected type at the given position.</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="TypeScript"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">interface</span> <span class="nx">PlainTermGoalParams</span> <span class="k">extends</span> <span class="nx">TextDocumentPositionParams</span> <span class="p">{}</span>

<span class="kd">interface</span> <span class="nx">PlainTermGoal</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">goal</span>: <span class="kt">string</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In the editor, the term goal state would be shown separately and below of the tactic state.  (This is sometimes a bit confusing in Lean 3, when the term goal was shown <em>instead</em> of the tactic state.)</p>

<p>I see, showing the term goal in addition to and after the tactic goal should address the concerns I had about this feature. For example, didn't test this in Lean 3, but we probably still want to look at the tactic goal when placing the cursor on <code>rw [h hp]</code></p>
