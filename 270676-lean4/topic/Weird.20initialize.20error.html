<p>When I use <code>initialize</code> with <code>@[extern] constant</code> Lean would complain that it <code>could not find native implementation of external declaration xxx</code>. The code is like this and the full example is provided <a href="https://github.com/xubaiw/weird-initialize">here</a>.</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">@[extern "foo_initialize"]</span> <span class="kd">constant</span> <span class="n">fooInit</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">IO</span> <span class="n">Unit</span>

<span class="n">initialize</span> <span class="n">fooInit</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The weird point is that when I change <code>initialize</code> to <code>builtin_initialize</code>, the code builds successfully.<br>
After doing some search I found some discussions about <code>initialize</code> and <code>builtin_initialize</code> from other topics.</p>

<p>Yes, it's not expected to also import a plugin, though we should probably make sure it still works since you might not be able to avoid it in case of some shared module. I'm not sure <code>initialize</code> being run in a plugin is even intended, usually <code>builtin*</code> means "run when native code is loaded, register into some global IO.Ref" and non-builtin means "run when imported, register into the environment".</p>

<p>I think<code> initialize</code>, despite its name, actually runs after initializing the environment, whereas <code>bulitin_initialize</code> actually runs during initialization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does this mean that the user provided external code should not be viewed as part of the package, and should always be called with <code>builtin_initialize</code>? And they are loaded whether or not the package is imported?</p>

<p>Note that I said this before user-defined attributes and environment extensions were supported. This may not be the case anymore (i.e., <code>initialize</code> now might run during initialization).</p>
