<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I proved (over the course of a 2 weeks' ~speedrun) Herbrand's [1] unification theorem [2] in the special case of the terms that appear in GoI flows [3] [4].</p>
<p>See the statement <a href="https://github.com/thejohncrafter/flows/blob/a208f51a10de24ffc1c8aed5a09072e8e45d83a9/MyPackage.lean#L1067-L1068">here</a> !</p>

<p>I am interested in formalizing <em>flows</em> [3] [4], which are object that allow to present low-level computations in a satisfactory way (up to my understanding).<br>
The first step towards this goal is this theorem that I proved.</p>
<p>I tried to formalize the theorem as quickly as possible, so the code is far from being perfect... but I will (at some point within the next 9 months) get back to it and clean it up.</p>
<p>There may be some things <a href="https://github.com/thejohncrafter/flows/blob/a208f51a10de24ffc1c8aed5a09072e8e45d83a9/MyPackage/Groundwork.lean">around here</a> (nontrivial inductions, finiteness and lower bounds) that may be relevant for mathlib4 if they were cleaned up a bit, I'm willing to spend some time at some point in a fairly near future on it if you think this is worth the effort.</p>

<p>Hello Julien.Marquet  :)  Thank you for contributing this Herbrand-Stuff  here ...<br>
FYI I have been passionate  amateur consumer of the leanprover-zulip-chats  about MathLib-Worlds since XMas-2020...<br>
I remember hearing abt Herbrand-Universes  while learning "Programming in Prolog"  during my TUM-Inf years in the early 1980s.<br>
... looking fwd to refreshing my  school-french reading-skill by reading your (in French) URLs ...<br>
Cheers from Muenchen-Moosach,  Franz</p>
