<p>Lean4 has a diverse community. To facilitate harmonious collaboration, we the developers propose the following community guidelines.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Be Gracious</strong>. People are working hard. If somebody implements a new feature, please say something nice before pointing out limitations. If you notice a rough edge, recognize that addressing it may not be others' highest priority and that sharing your frustration may not be productive.</li>
<li><strong>Be Humble</strong>. Lean is a sophisticated system. When phrasing suggestions, please consider the possibility that your suggestions may be unwise or otherwise problematic, especially if you are not an expert.</li>
<li><strong>Stay United</strong>. Fragmentation will hurt all of us in the long run. We are committed to developing one version of Lean that serves all of our sub-communities. Please do not even consider releasing an alternate version except as an absolute last resort.</li>
</ol>
<p>If anybody notices a transgression of these guidelines in this stream, we kindly ask that you tag it with the <span aria-label="butterfly" class="emoji emoji-1f98b" role="img" title="butterfly">:butterfly:</span> icon. This icon should be interpreted as a friendly nudge only and not a castigation.</p>
