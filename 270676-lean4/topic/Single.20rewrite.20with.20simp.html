<p>Is there a way to restrict <code>simp</code> to perform at most one rewrite? Setting <code>singlePass</code> to true is really helpful, but it can actually perform multiple rewrites.</p>
<p>I'm in a scenario when a single pass is doing some rewrites but the whole pass takes me back to the original goal. I can make sense of what is happening from the trace but I would like to play with the goal after a single rewrite to figure out how to prevent the loop.</p>

<p>Also is there a tactic to run only beta reduction? There is <code>delta</code>, but no other like beta, zeta, eta, iota.</p>

<p>This question is somewhat similar to one of my first questions here on Zulip:<br>

<p>I wanted to know if there was a way to have full control over <code>simp</code></p>

<p>If you want to only rewrite some occurrences, then you could try the <code>conv</code> tactic which allows you to "zoom" in on subterms and only run simp there.</p>

<p>There is also <code>rw</code>, which restricts rewriting in another way.  (It only rewrites once, not under binders, but it rewrites all occurrences of the same term.)</p>

<p>Yes I'm familiar with <code>conv</code> and <code>rw</code> but what I'm asking is more for debugging <code>simp</code>. I just want a single rewrite of <code>simp</code>. I can achieve this by running <code>simp</code>, looking at the trace, finding the name of the first rewrite and then manually doing the rewrite with <code>rw</code>. I find this tedious.</p>

<p>Ohh I can get beta, zeta, ... with <code>simp (config := { ... }) only</code></p>
