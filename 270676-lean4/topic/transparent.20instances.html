<p>I'm trying to write some category theory in Lean 4.<br>
I essentially ported mathlib's code, and I have this notation for arrows:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="n">HasHom</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">α</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span> <span class="n">u</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Sort</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">max</span> <span class="n">u</span> <span class="n">v</span> <span class="bp">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="n">where</span>
  <span class="n">hom</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">α</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">α</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="kt">Sort</span> <span class="n">v</span>

<span class="kd">infixr</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">10</span> <span class="s2">"⟶"</span> <span class="bp">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">HasHom.hom</span> <span class="c1">-- \h</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I defined <code>Category</code> and <code>Functor</code>, then the category of categories.<br>
I have this notation for functors:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">infixr</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">26</span> <span class="s2">"⥤"</span> <span class="bp">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">Functor</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>(By the way, I choose to have all objects bundled, rather than a carrier+typeclass setup. That is why <code>Functor</code> and <code>Category</code> are structures to me here, rather than a typeclass, and I don't have "unbundled functors". This works well in Lean 4 imho, at least in my use case.)</p>
<p>Now, in the category of categories, I of course defined arrows between <code>C</code> and <code>D</code> to be functors <code>C ⥤ D</code>.<br>
The thing is, the notation <code>C ⥤ D</code> is more natural than <code>C ⟶ D</code> for functors, and sometimes it makes more sense to define some constructions on <code>Functor</code> than on <code> - ⟶ -</code> (it's the case to me when I define a product of functors as a functor between the products).<br>
Is it possible to make Lean remove the typeclass application whenever it sees <code>C ⟶ D</code>, to instead desugar it to <code>C ⥤ D</code>?</p>
<p>I guess this behavior would be something like "transparent instances", just like marking a definition <code>@[reducible]</code> makes it transparent to typeclass resolution.</p>
<p>(I guess it would also make sense to have a similar behavior for other objets where arrows also make sense "outside of the category", possibly in linear maps between vector spaces, but I can't really find another compelling example than the functors off the top of my head.)</p>

<p>Actually now that I think of it there may be more places where such a behavior would be relevant: for instance, if I define monoidal categories, I want to have a notation for monoidal functors, and I also want to be able to write about functors between monoidal categories by forgetting the monoidal structure. I guess this situation can be generalized to any category with additional structure.<br>
Also, if I want to write about formal semantics, I may want to have a category between terms where arrows are reductions (I'm kind of making that up though, I don't really know how it's done), then I want the reductions to be properly denoted with a wiggly arrow rather than the <code>hom</code> arrow. This goes beyond notation: there is additional structure in reductions (for instance, I may want to define deduction rules for my reductions) that has not much to do with the categorical structure.</p>

<p>I don't know the answer, but I think it's an important question. In mathlib, it routinely causes a lot of pain to go back and forth between, say, linear maps and morphisms in <code>Module R</code>.</p>

<p>We've used some tricks in some cases, e.g. <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/category_theory.Sheaf.hom">docs#category_theory.Sheaf.hom</a> is a structure wrapper around natural transformations for precisely this reason</p>
