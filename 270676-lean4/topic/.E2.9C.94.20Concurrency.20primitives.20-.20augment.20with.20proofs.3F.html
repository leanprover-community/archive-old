<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span>  Thanks, I think I'll start with a simple requirement without concurrency (enforcing a specific order on acquiring mutex locks) and see how that goes. Then I can think about representing concurrent code.<br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="395550">@Henrik Böving</span> The choreographic structure looks like an interesting approach. I feel like you could just use a monad transformer to dispatch code to one (or some) wrapped monads? I guess exceptions would still be tricky in that case.</p>
