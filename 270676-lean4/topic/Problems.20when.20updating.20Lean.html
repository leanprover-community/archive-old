<p>So I was attempting to update Lake to latest Lean version today (I had not done so since the 07-28 nightly) and ran into some challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updating to the 08-04 nightly works fine</li>
<li>Updating to the 08-05 nightly  (the zero-cost oleans feature) or future versions causes the basic hello world package to hang/segfault consistently when building. Surprisingly, it does not, however, cause the bootstrap package (or many of the others) to segfault.</li>
<li>Updating to the 08-12 nightly adds no new problems</li>
<li>Updating to the 08-13 nightly or future versions causes Lake to experience major performance degradation due to a very long startup time. To give an idea of the time scale: before this nightly, building Lake with Lake was faster than building with make (lake: ~21s vs make: ~29s); after this nightly, make is faster (make: ~29s vs lake: ~50s).</li>
</ul>
<p>I have no idea why the 08-05 nightly causes the hello world package to segfault. I do have a guess for the 08-13 problem, though. It may come from the parser changes in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/589">#589</a> which may be slowing down Lake's parsing of the package configuration files. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span>, does that sound  possible and, if so, is there a way for me to fix this?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span> Then, do you have any other ideas as to what could be causing the performance problems in the 08-13 nightly? Or, for that matter, the segfault in 08-05 nightly?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span>  True, testing is always better than guessing and the more testing the better. XD</p>
<p>I did some more testing and it appears that the performance issue is, in fact, with 08-12 nightly, not the 08-13 nightly. I could swear that the first time I tested the 08-12 nightly there were no performance issues, but repeated testing seems to have proven otherwise.</p>

<p>Despite the empirical data, this makes much less sense to me as nothing in the 08-12 nightly release notes seems like it should be able to cause the problems I'm observing.</p>

<p>Well, I believe I have figured out the cause of the performance problems! I shut off my cloud sync and the problem disappeared.</p>
<p>I suspect that my cloud sync and Lean/Lake are in some manner competing over access to the oleans and this caused the performance problems. It is still a mystery to me why this only becomes a consistent problem on/after the 08-12 nightly., though.</p>
<p>I also still have not figured out why building the hello package segfaults on/after the 08-05 nightly.</p>

<p>I have to take that back, I can't reproduce it anymore on <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/commit/a0c2142233d92cf85fdbd39238a92d7f558beb43">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/commit/a0c2142233d92cf85fdbd39238a92d7f558beb43</a> (the latest compatible commit). I must have accidentally run Lake with a different Lean version in the PATH from what I used to compile Lake, thus a .olean version mismatch.</p>
