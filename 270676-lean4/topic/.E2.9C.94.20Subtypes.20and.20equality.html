<blockquote>
<p>Equality of types is "evil" in Lean -- for example <code>Nat = Int</code> is undecidable and your example might be too. In the cardinality model of Lean's type theory the subtypes might be equal simply because they have the same size.</p>

<p>I was afraid of that -- the whole time it felt a bit strange since we usually talk about equality of terms and not types, but I guess it's good to have confirmation that using it this way isn't really intended.</p>
