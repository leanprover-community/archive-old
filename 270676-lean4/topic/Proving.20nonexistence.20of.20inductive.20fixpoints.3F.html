<p>I'm trying to figure out how to prove that a term that I cannot construct a term that would be some sort of (coinductive?) fixpoint of an inductive term. The catch is that the recursion is 'hidden' by a function term. Something like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">inductive</span> <span class="n">Object</span>
  <span class="bp">|</span> <span class="n">mk</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">subobjects</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Nat</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">Option</span> <span class="n">Object</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">Object</span>

<span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">Object.subobjects</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Object</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">Nat</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">Option</span> <span class="n">Object</span>
  <span class="bp">|</span> <span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">mk</span> <span class="n">sub</span> <span class="bp">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">sub</span>

<span class="kd">theorem</span> <span class="n">no_suboject_self</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="bp">∀</span> <span class="n">o</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Object</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="bp">¬∃</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">o.subobjects</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="n">some</span> <span class="n">o</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="gr">sorry</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I'm sure there's some nice type-theoretic background to this that I don't have <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span> can someone here maybe help me out, how would I prove something like <code>no_subobject_self</code>? </p>
<p>(BTW: I posted this here since I'm working with Lean4, but happy to move it if it makes more sense in a different stream)</p>

<p>Unfortunately that's a really bad combination of features for lean right now. <code>induction</code> doesn't support nested inductives, and well founded recursion doesn't support inductives with rank higher than omega (in your case, this is caused by the <code>(Nat -&gt; T) -&gt; T</code> style constructor</p>

<p>You can do it but you basically have to construct the proof term manually</p>
