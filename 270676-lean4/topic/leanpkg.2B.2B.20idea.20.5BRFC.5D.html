<p>One of the big planned steps forward for Lean is a fully feature package mean (a <code>leanpkg++</code>). Currently, the <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/397">idea</a> seems to be to model Rust's <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo">Cargo</a>, hence the current similar TOML manifests. </p>
<p>However, unlike Rust, Lean is both a bootstrapped <em>and interpretable</em> language. So, I propose we instead follow the model of other interpreted languages (like Ruby) and dispense with the TOML manifests and have a project's build/packaging scripts written in Lean (like Ruby's <code>Rakefile</code>/<code>Gemfile</code>).</p>
<p>For example, a simple build script based off the manifest currently produced by <code>leanpkg init</code> could look like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Leanpkg</span>
<span class="kn">open</span> <span class="n">Leanpkg</span>

<span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">manifest</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Manifest</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="s2">"Leanstrap"</span>
  <span class="n">version</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="s2">"0.1"</span>
  <span class="n">leanVersion</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="s2">"leanprover/lean4:nightly-2021-05-18"</span><span class="o">,</span>
  <span class="n">dependencies</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="o">[</span>
    <span class="o">{</span>
      <span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="s2">"mathlib4"</span><span class="o">,</span>
      <span class="n">src</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">Source.git</span>
        <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">url</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="s2">"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4.git"</span><span class="o">)</span>
        <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">rev</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="s2">"e5cd871f3d59d344521f01821a3e48b744c756d9"</span><span class="o">)</span>
        <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">branch</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="s2">"master"</span><span class="o">)</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="o">]</span>
<span class="o">}</span>

<span class="k">#eval</span> <span class="n">build</span> <span class="n">manifest</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>For synergy with the <code>leanpkg</code> command, this could be done more intelligently by tagging various <code>def</code>s with attributes that <code>leanpkg</code> picks up on and uses. For example, say we had the following <code>Leanpkg.lean</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">@[manifest]</span>
<span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">manifest</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Manifest</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">name</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="s2">"Leanstrap"</span>
    <span class="n">version</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="s2">"0.1"</span>
    <span class="n">leanVersion</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="s2">"leanprover/lean4:nightly-2021-05-18"</span><span class="o">,</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>leanpkg</code> command could read this file and build the project using the tagged <code>@[manifest]</code> definition as the manifest. Ideally, it would also support things like custom build, configure, and test hooks, and even support for running custom commands.</p>
<p><strong>What do people think of this idea?</strong></p>

<p>I think the main risk of using a build script rather than a file is essentially tied to the "expression problem".</p>
<p>There are potentially many things want to leverage in a build system beyond just build the software.  Even for building, you want information about dependencies so you can compute dependencies up front, resolve version constraints, create "freeze" files, etc.  There's also non-build tasks like building documentation, running tests, etc, creating descriptions and license information for a package library such as <code>crates.io</code>.</p>
<p>There is no reason all this couldn't be done with  a build script, but I think a declarative model that describes data rather than code is more easily extensible to support these other uses of build information.</p>

<p>I should add I'm currently looking into how to modify <code>cargo</code> itself to build non-rust packages.  Making this robust will be a lot of work, but would have the long term benefit of not requiring continued maintenance of a package system and would make it easier to depend on Rust packages in Lean (and vice-versa).</p>

<p>I'm a fan of this approach. Not all packages are simple to build, and even cargo supports this kind of scripting with <code>build.rs</code>. I'm sympathetic to the idea of having a declarative manifest like a toml file, but I would like to know more specifically what the value proposition is, and in particular whether it would suffice to have a manifest object in the lean file like the one pictured, which leanpkg can print out as TOML or JSON if desired by some external tool.</p>

<p>that's what FAKE does, they use F# types to describe data and then F# code to implement it. It work there... but the moment you need to call a shell, you really need a decent base class library or it gets painful.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think these both two points tie together quite nicely, in order for this approach to work smoothly your will need a robust library and packaging tool (<code>leanpkg</code>). The library needs to provide ways to neatly express a lot of declarative things (like a manifest, or more modularly, dependencies, version constraints etc.) and <code>leanpkg</code> needs to be able to read the script and present this information in manner that is easily consumed by humans and other tools. With the current tiny <code>leanpkg</code> this could be something like a <code>print-manifest</code> command that prints the Lean manifest as a TOML file (which I think is quite feasible). As more hooks and such are added, this will of course need to grow to become more complex.</p>
<p>However, I think in the long run this offers a lot flexible, and, if done well, can as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="235513">@Daniel Fabian</span> put it "be delightful". and I think Lean's extensive metaprogramming facilities make this a feasible goal. I would also certainly advise following existing examples of this (like Ruby's <code>rake</code> and F*'s <code>fake</code>) along with features from state-of-art package managers (like <code>cargo</code> and <code>npm</code>).</p>

<p>What if the <code>Manifest</code> type contained a bunch of thunks for getting the dependencies, running the build, enumerating the tests and so on, and different invocations of leanpkg will compute the manifest, run the thunks relevant to the current operation, and then perform the operation?</p>

<p>In general, I think, what the languages like F# or lean have that can make this potentially work, is a strong type system. I.e. you could use a library, <code>leanpackage</code> to provide all the necessary functionality, and types, such that a build script has a minimal amount of structure to it. In case of FAKE they are tasks with dependencies. In the lean case it would probably be that plus some package metadata, etc. Then <code>leanpackage</code> would execute the script and be allowed to assume something about the structure. Almost like having an interface for the build scripts.</p>
<p>What definitely does work really well in the FAKE case is the library of helpers built for FAKE is quite impressive, from <code>zip</code> over <code>ftp</code> to <code>nuget</code>, etc. everything is around.</p>
<p>It's a radically different approach than trying to adopt <code>cargo</code> to lean.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110994">@Joe Hendrix</span>  how does that resonate with you?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="235513">@Daniel Fabian</span> I'm still a bit partial to the Cargo approach still but that's mostly because I like the idea of reusing the work invested in another package manager or build system.</p>
<p>If <code>leanpkg</code> can just take this and print out a <code>Cargo.toml</code> file (or some other format), then this sounds more like a EDSL for building TOML/JSON files for other build systems.   I'm not opposed to it, but hope the files are small enough for this not be necessary.</p>

I don't have a strong technical preference , but am exploring cargo integration for a couple questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>I think integration with another package management tool may make it easier for people to try out Lean.</li>
<li>I think this could reduce the maintenance involved so folks in the Lean community can focus on other problems.</li>

<p>I think Lean is expressive enough that you can support both though. For most simple configurations there can be a one-to-one matching with a static file format, but for more complex use cases (where, for example, custom run tasks are desired) the more powerful features can be used as well.</p>

<p>After some feasibility investigations and conversations with some other open-source package managers, we'd like to give the FAKE-style package manager a chance (see: <a href="https://github.com/fsharp/FAKE">https://github.com/fsharp/FAKE</a>). Here's some of the reasoning:</p>
<ul>
<li>built in lean: this makes outside contributions quite a lot easier</li>
<li>small core: at the core, we only need notions of manifest, task and dependency. </li>
<li>community friendly: everything outside of the core is extremely hackable, and the small core is very stable.</li>
<li>extremely expressive: given that the building DSL is embedded in Lean as opposed to being external, you can always fall back to the full expressivity of lean. So you should never get stuck with the language not being expressive enough for your project.</li>
<li>it's a fine starting point for production use of lean 4: Since this is programming a programming project, it should be fairly pain-free to code up, since we won't find missing tactics or similar blocking progress. And also, since lean 4 itself is written in lean 4 on the programming side, I think, we are in a good place to start building software.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd like for this project to be mostly community-driven. The way how it works for FAKE, and it work really well in that community, is that beyond the core, there are tons of helpers for various things you might want to do. They are things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>execute the compiler</li>
<li>build documentation</li>
<li>create a nuget package</li>
<li>upload to nuget</li>
<li>download from nuget</li>
<li>create a zip file</li>
<li>upload to ftp</li>
<li>and many more</li>
</ul>
<p>The helpers are fairly volatile and very actively developed and it's easy to accept contributions so the build system can evolve quickly.</p>

<p>It's the helper's responsibility. In FAKE, you might just call <code>msbuild</code> which has a notion of not rebuilding everything every time. We might have a <code>nix</code> task to get it off the ground quickly, at a later point in time, we could have one that calls the compiler directly.</p>

<p>In my experience, sbt is completely ok as long you as you don't do anything fancy.  IMHO its biggest shortcoming is that it tries to use magic to make things look simpler instead of using normal Scala code.  (E.g you have top-level settings in addition to settings(), you have the whole key horror instead of using function arguments, etc.  And since it's all custom-made you can't just use the REPL or println to debug it.)</p>

<p>I would caution against NIH. My impression is that all these language-specific build systems inevitably blossom into a major time sink and possibly a pile of hacks. By a quick count, FAKE has some 60kloc, Cabal (for Haskell) 40kloc, sbt 70kloc (including tests). Not saying it can't be done, but if an off-the-shelf build system and package manager would do, what would we lose?</p>

<p>Right. They're planning to add support soon (TM) at least. In any case, I don't want to advocate for any particular solution; I don't have strong opinions on available build systems or package managers. I just wanted to point out that it might be prudent to spend some time thoroughly researching the available options before embarking on a large project.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>If you're planning to implement only a small core, say 10kloc, that just means other people have to implement the other 50kloc (or perhaps 30kloc; maybe some of these helpers are very special-purpose). There's a bunch of inescapable complexity here and I suspect many details of the design will not be immediately clear. There's also the question of documentation, both internal and user-facing. Existing tools have solved a lot of little problems that, imo, we shouldn't solve again if it can be avoided. But I'm only speaking in generalities here; I don't have any privileged information to offer, so I'll shut up for now. (FWIW, reimplementing Shake in Lean sounds reasonable to me, then you at least have a nice design good to go.)</p>

<p>I mean this already going to be part of the the buy-in of Lean. Large packages in Lean are likely to define all kinds of DSLs using leans metaprogramming features to represent concepts within them. So I think getting a feel for the DSLs of a given larger project/package is inevitable part of using Lean.</p>
<p>However, for many smaller, les complex packages, I imagine the <code>.lean</code> packaging file will be much the same as an ordinary <code>.toml</code> config file, just written in Lean. I would think this would be much easier on new comers as instead of having two learn the intricacies of two languages (i.e., the build system language and Lean), you just have to learn one --- Lean.</p>

<p>we can also generate a <code>.toml</code> or <code>.json</code> for machine reading purposes. If we want to upload to github or something. JSON or TOML are much less of a dependency than lean if all you care about is for it to be machine-readable manifests. But having lean be the source of truth is fine.</p>

<p>As someone who just discovered Lean yesterday, and mostly familiar with Cargo, I have to say the build-file-in-lean-itself approach absolutely terrifies me. It's less so about Lean syntax, and more about the declarative vs imperative paradigm. The thing I like about Cargo is that you define <em>the project</em>, and not <em>how to build the project</em> - Cargo just figures that out for you. Seeing functions named <code>configure</code> and <code>build</code> feels very wrong (unless in the rare case I need to do something fancy, then sure, allow for custom build scripts).</p>

<p>The strong conventions making most configuration implicit and hide-able in Cargo is also a big plus. I would never want to specify where my source files are (<code>src/*</code> just being implicit), or where my binaries should go (<code>bin/*</code>). That should be the responsibility cargo/leanpkg. I just want to code lean, not have to worry about how to structure my project and how to build it.</p>

<p>Having <em>less</em> configuration options can be a good thing. It means less things you have to consider, less things to do wrong, and most importantly: All the projects you find on github have the same structure, so picking them up is very easy, and you don't have to investigate where the main.c file is (no, not this one, the <em>real</em> main file, which is specified somewhere in the 500 loc Makefile), which dependencies go where, etc. It has a... normative effect, I would say?<br>
But also, take everything I say with a grain of salt, since I am a newcomer and a dummy :).</p>

<p>The thing I like about Cargo is that you define <em>the project</em>, and not <em>how to build the project</em> - Cargo just figures that out for you. Seeing functions named <code>configure</code> and <code>build</code> feels very wrong (unless in the rare case I need to do something fancy, then sure, allow for custom build scripts).</p>

<p>You should be happy to learn that that is the goal! As this evolves basic projects should only need to have a declarative manifest and nothing else. Only when custom build scripts are needed will functions like <code>build</code> and <code>configure</code> be used.</p>

<p>I think this is one of the great schism in computer science. Some people like opinionated systems because it enables uniformity in interaction. Others like highly unopinionated systems because it allows to follow their own style (which they may themselves be highly opinionated about). I fall in the later camp. I want the tools I use to allow my to structure things how I want and express things how I want. I would note that this not an uncommon desire in computer science and can be seen to tie into <a href="https://lawsofux.com/postels-law/">Postel's Law</a> of UX -- i.e., being flexible in what a tool accepts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the planned simple defaults I mentioned, should make most setups rather the same unless users go out of there way to change things. So, hopefully, there won't be to too much diversity in eventual setups. After all, nothing in C's build system requires source folders to be named <code>src</code> or header folders to be named <code>include</code> and yet the community has mostly come around to that practice.</p>

<p>I would also like to re-emphasize this point: this stage of the prototype is simply meant to get a functional examples of Lean packages building through Lean file. <strong>It is not meant to be example of the final API / intended structure of said build / configuration files.</strong></p>

<p>Wouldn't the goal be to have each theory of the mathlib be a separate package, so to avoid an enormous mono-package? When I need something from the mathlib, my intuition says that I would add a dependency a la <code>vector_fields = { version = "1.0", in = "mathlib/linalg" }</code>, with <code>in</code> being some way to navigate around a directory of packages.<br>
Either way, I'm probably way underqualified for this. All I can offer is the newcomer perspective. If that stops being helpful, do tell me.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="416280">@Max</span> the splitting of mathlib into a lot of small packages is something that has been discussed multiple times. I think, so far, there hasn't been a clear path how to achieve it, though. From what I understand (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> understands the problem space much more deeply than I do), mathlib seems to have such a complex dependency graph, that taking even a small part of mathematics transitively pulls in a huge part of mathlib.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110994">@Joe Hendrix</span> one of the issues is the problem of needing tactics to be compiled before use in mathlib proper for efficiency (but of course the tactics depend on some math), see some of the comments in the mathlib4 thread, there were different solutions proposed:<br>
<span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="110049">Mario Carneiro</span> <a href="#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/Mathlib.204/near/237986680">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Additionally, as I've mentioned before, there is a second mathlib spinoff project, that I'm calling the mathlib prelude. This will collect all the tactics used by mathlib proper such as <code>ring</code>, <code>linarith</code> and the myriad small tactics. Due to lean 4's architecture, it is necessary for these tactics to exist in a separate compilation unit so that they can be available in their compiled form in mathlib. (You can use a tactic immediately after its definition but this uses the interpreter and so doesn't benefit from the tremendous work done on the lean 4 compiler.)</p>
<p>Which brings me to the issue: should these two be separate repositories or not? I think that having all of mathlib in one monorepo reduces the maintenance cost of adding features to lean significantly, and I think most would agree that making even a comparatively simple change in lean core today is higher friction than adding to mathlib, since at the very least a new version of lean containing the modification has to be released and mathlib updated for the new version, both things that mathlib changes don't have to worry about.</p>
<p>A natural solution would be to have mathlib and the prelude in two folders of one repo. But I don't know if lean 4 (or more accurately leanpkg) can currently handle packages that exist in subfolders of a repo.</p>

<p>I think it's important to gather requirements as these, i.e. subfolder as packages. Since the requirements need to drive our development of the new leanpkg.</p>

<p>Hey, I'm back again to give a status report. The leanpkg++ project has been renamed Lake (aka Lean Make) with the repository for the prototype now located here: <a href="https://github.com/tydeu/lean4-lake">https://github.com/tydeu/lean4-lake</a>. It <em>should</em> now be at feature parity with the existing leanpkg, so feel free to take it for a spin. If you find something is broken/missing, please let me know!</p>

<p>Oh, sorry. Yeah, I should have probably added some build and run instructions. You need to build Lake with <code>leanpkg build bin LINK_OPTs=-rdynamic</code> on Unix platforms or <code>leanpkg build bin LINK_OPTS="-Wl,--export-all"</code> on Windows. When running the executable, you need to include the build directory of Lake and lib directory of lean (ex. <code>&lt;lean-home&gt;/lib/lean</code>) in <code>LEAN_PATH</code>. Alternatively, you can run it interpreted as the examples do.</p>
<p>I'll update the README soon.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="414345">@Xubai Wang</span> How exactly do you want to interact with the library? Have you written some C Lean bindings for the Rust library that you want to link to your Lean code that is using <code>extern</code>? Or do you have something else in mind? It would be easier to provide an example if I have some information about your use case. However, if you do already have C bindings, you should just be able add <code>path/to/libBindings.a</code> to the <code>linkArgs</code> for the package (if you are using the latest Lake master).</p>

<p>Also, since this topic has ben resuscitated, I should mention that development on Lake has progressed to the point where Lean packages (oleans, static libraries, and binaries) are now built entirely within Lake (no more Makefiles required). The next step is largely UX -- improving Lake's CLI and API to the point where it is as useful as can be to the Lean 4 community. </p>
<p>This means that if anyone has a project with a somewhat complex build setup they want try Lake with, I am more than willing to assist in getting things working (and tweaking Lake as needed). However, do be warned that Lake is very bleeding edge, and has only been minimally tested, so things may blow up from time-to-time. So only experiment with it if you are okay with such dangers.</p>

<p>On another note, I feel I should mention that Lake's API is still in the prototyping stages and is liable to change at anytime. I hinted at this before (when I described Lake as "bleeding edge"), but I feel I should reiterate this to make sure no one plans on relying on the API in  Lake's <code>master</code> branch to remain stable in any significant way.</p>
