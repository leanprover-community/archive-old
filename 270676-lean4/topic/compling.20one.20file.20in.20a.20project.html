<p>Right now I'm playing around a lot with mathlib4, which takes a few minutes to compile. Sometimes I want to switch between branches quickly and just see what happens if I compile one specific file. In Lean 3 I could just do <code>lean --make src/file/I/want/to/test.lean</code> on the command line and generate the relevant oleans so that if I e.g. then crash VS Code with a large amount of trace output (which I just did) then I can just fire it up again and the file I'm testing compiles instantly. Is there a way of doing this in Lean 4 or am I thinking about things in the wrong way? If I type <code>lake build</code> then I end up building all of mathlib, which I don't want to do, and I'm always nervous about breaking out of <code>lake build</code> during the build process in case I end up with a borked repo.</p>

<p><code>lake build +Mathlib.Algebra.Hom.GroupInstances</code>seems to work</p>
