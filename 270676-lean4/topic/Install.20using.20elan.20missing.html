<p>Someone who is trying to install Lean 4 on a Windows machine machine I don't have access to right now, following to quickstart guide, claims that the "Install Lean using Elan" popup doesn't appear. Is this something known, or do you think it is the case that they are probably doing something wrong?</p>

<p>Sorry, nevermind, it seems they did't create a new .lean file, and the popup didn't simply appear on select language</p>
