<p>Why does this work?:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">partial</span> <span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">part</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Nat</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Nat</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">part</span> <span class="n">x</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>I was expecting <code>safe</code> to be required to be marked as partial as well, as it calls a partial function.</p>

<p>What you are talking about would be  the behaviour of<code>unsafe</code> (which is what partial uses under the hood)  The Lean 4 manual states:<br>
When the partial keyword is used, Lean generates an auxiliary unsafe definition that uses general recursion, and then defines an opaque constant that is implemented by this auxiliary definition.</p>
<p>Meaning that <code>partial</code> desugars to an <code>unsafe def</code> and a <code>constant</code> which is marked with an <code>@implementedBy</code> attribute pointing to the unsafe implementation and is thus logically sound (since <code>constant</code> types have to be inhabited).</p>
