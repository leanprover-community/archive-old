<p>Basic question, but: in Lean 3 we seemed to be able to do things like</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">instance</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">α</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span><span class="bp">*</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">foo</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">foo</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">bar</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="bp">...</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>and then, in other definitions, <code>bar.foo α</code> could be used to refer to that instance. (This doesn't seem to work anymore.)</p>
<p>What's the equivalent way to refer to that instance in Lean 4?</p>
<p>(I tried <code>(_) : foo (bar α)</code>, but I'm not sure this is the best way.)</p>

<p>I think you can use <code>#synth foo (bar \a)</code> to print the name of the instance</p>

<p>Nice, that works thanks! (I just had to put <code>variable (α : Type) [HasBtw α]</code> in front). Looks like it's <code>instFooBar</code> in general!</p>

<p>Some people would discourage explicit references to the auto-generated name.</p>

<p>Lean itself discourages the reference by making the name obnoxiously long now ;)</p>

<p>Hmm, yeah, but a mathlib file I’m porting uses explicit references in Lean 3. Should I try to find a workaround, or is it ok to reference it directly?</p>

<p>Yeah this came up with a file I was porting and I just translated the proof ie used the new instance names explicitly because I figured that if it was bad style then it wasn't really my fault</p>

<p>I've been going back and renaming the automatically named instances whenever I want to refer to them by hand.</p>
