<p>Would there be interest in a wrapper for <a href="https://github.com/plasma-umass/coz">Coz</a>? Could be useful as we are working out the right way to test code :)</p>

<p>(And I could probably get a lake script working that automatically runs your code with coz and stuff)</p>

<p>I never used Coz, but it sounds interesting. I am a big fan of <code>perf</code>+<code>hotspot</code>. How do they compare to each other?</p>

<p>I'm not really familiar with any of the three, but Coz finds code segments that will improve the overall throughput/latency, which is NOT necessarily the code segments that the most time is spent on (which is moreso what I think <code>perf</code> tells you about?).</p>
<p>I believe Coz also does some additional work to ensure benchmarks aren't affected by things like code alignment, which can wildly affect code performance purely on the basis of how the C compiler arranges your code, not what your code is actually doing</p>
