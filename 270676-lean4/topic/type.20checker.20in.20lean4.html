<p>is it reasonable to write a type checker for a small calculus  in lean4? I have tried to write it in lean3 and found that many "simple" things have not implemented fully</p>

<p>Yes it is. You could also be a bit more specific with what issues you encountered with Lean 3, perhaps Lean 4's addressed them directly or indirectly. I will say that 'simply programming' in Lean 4 (i.e.  disregarding proofs) is miles ahead of Lean 3 in terms of convenience and ergonomics.</p>

<p>You will find that right now the Lean 4 builtin libraries are certainly lacking a bit if functionality that you might expect from more evolved programming languages but since Lean is perfectly capable of interpreting itself right now I see no reason why it shouldnt be possible to interpret something simpler with it.</p>

<p>thanks, are you aware of any snippets of code that could be useful? (not examples with proofs or really simple programs)</p>

<p>Useful in what regard? For writing a type checker for some lambda calculus no. For general programs that are done in Lean you could take a look at:</p>
<ul>
<li>The compiler itself</li>
<li>The Lake build system</li>
<li>The doc-gen4 docuemntation generator (although its mostly a Meta program for Lean 4 itself)</li>
<li>Sebastian posted his AoC solutions over here <a href="https://github.com/Kha/aoc-2021/">https://github.com/Kha/aoc-2021/</a></li>
<li>There is some non trivial datastructure code for stuff like binary heaps in mathlib4 as of now.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mario Carneiro wrote a metamath verifier in Lean 4, but quite a bit has changed in the last nine months (for the better). <a href="https://github.com/digama0/mm-lean4">https://github.com/digama0/mm-lean4</a></p>
