<p>By the way, I would be interested to hear about your reasons for preferring to turn them off. This feature is still somewhat in an experimentation phase.</p>

<p>Basically to protect myself from my own negligence. I just had a constructor using some <code>x</code> intended as an autobound variable, but actually I had in another imported file some <code>def x := ...</code>, so the <code>x</code> was actually referring to that rather than being a variable. And because of this I spent some time not understanding why an induction case complained about a wrong number of arguments.</p>

<p>But I think it's a nice feature and can make code more readable in some situations, but requires some discipline on the part of the programmer which I just wanted to skip when just playing around and doing experiments</p>

<p>Hah, that is exactly the anticipated failure case, yes. Semantic highlighting should warn you about it, but you first have to be aware of it doing that of course.</p>

<p>Perhaps we should try to find a more noticeable highlighting for implicits specifically <a href="/user_uploads/3121/1rQo5puF13hDQKNVDJQhDxAW/image.png">image.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/3121/1rQo5puF13hDQKNVDJQhDxAW/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/3121/1rQo5puF13hDQKNVDJQhDxAW/image.png"></a></div>

<p>Oh, I see now. Yes, I certainly didn't notice or think of the difference in highlighting in that moment :)</p>
