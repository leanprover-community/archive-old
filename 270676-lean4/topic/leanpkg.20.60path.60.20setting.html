<p>What is the <code>path</code> setting in a <code>leanpkg.toml</code> file suppose to do (i.e. what is it used for)?</p>

<p>Lean 3 leftover, we should probably remove it. I'd rather have something like Cargo's workspaces to enable more dynamic directory layouts.</p>

<p>I had no understanding of the discussion about plugins / repos containing more than one library earlier, but is this related to it?</p>

<p>Not really I'd say; since you can have only one leanpkg.toml per directory and exactly one package per leanpkg.toml, you'll first have to find a place for those in a multi-package repo. When you've done that, or changed the format to allow for multiple packages in a single directory, there is still no reason to place the source code at a nonstandard location relative to its leanpkg.toml file.</p>
