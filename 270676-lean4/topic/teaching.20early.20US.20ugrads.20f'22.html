<p>I am teaching an intro to proofs for math majors this fall (2022). This is my second time. The previous time I incorporated Lean 3 following <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110865">@Jeremy Avigad</span> 's course at CMU <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/logic_and_proof/">Logic and proof</a>. I wanted to get a communal sense of moving to Lean 4 for this. (Perhaps mainly for those already familiar with Logic and Proof) What are the main gaps I would need to fill in at the moment?</p>

<p>I don't see what could be missing. If I remember correctly this book doesn't use mathlib at all. However you probably won't gain much by switching to Lean 4. Students won't have to remember to use commas but they will fail because of whitespace sensitivity.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="306577">@Matthew Ballard</span>, just for reference, I teach in the US (and did undergraduate and graduate school here), and I agree with Patrick. The first 10 chapters are full of a bunch of things that are not frequently taught to math undergraduates. For example, most students (nay, I would argue most mathematicians I know) don't understand the distinction between natural deduction and classical reasoning (although they may have some idea that there is a thing called constructivism and maybe they have heard of intuitionist logic). Most students never hear about soundness and completeness (except perhaps in the context of Gödel's theorem, but even then, they probably can't explain what "completeness" means here).</p>
<p>That being said, most intro to proof courses I have seen in the US do spend a few weeks at the beginning of the semester covering the basics of propositional and first-order logic.</p>

<p>I certainly teach sets, functions and relations to students part of their intro to proof course which they do the moment they walk through the doors. But, like Patrick, I've never learnt or taught natural deduction, and I only heard about the concept of 1st order logic and the word "semantic" because I did the optional 3rd year logic and set theory course.</p>

<p>distinction between natural deduction and classical reasoning </p>
</blockquote>
<p>What distinction do you mean? Classical reasoning makes perfect sense for natural deduction -  see 5.1 in <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/logic_and_proof/classical_reasoning.html#proof-by-contradiction">Logic and Proof</a>. Natural deduction can be both classical or intuitionistic, the difference is including or excluding one rule.</p>
<p>I think I know what you mean though. Nevertheless, proof-by-contradiction is a standard topic in intro-to-proofs courses in the US. As a backbone, many such courses use (slightly disguised) forms of natural deduction or variants, and very few use Hilbert style proofs.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="306577">@Matthew Ballard</span> This fall, I'll be focused on working on two other textbooks -- <em>Logic and Mechanized Reasoning</em> and <em>Mathematics in Lean</em>, but I'd love to see <em>Logic and Proof</em> ported to Lean 4 and updated to be more useful for teaching. </p>
<p>My co-authors (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110596">@Rob Lewis</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="111080">@Floris van Doorn</span>) might have other views, but I am not wedded to the prominence of logic. I think seeing some logic is generally helpful: if helps students understand formalism and what is going on under the hood, it helps them think about the way the form of the hypotheses and goal structure a proof, and it is generally useful for applications to CS -- programming and using database queries and so on. But I would not be sorry to see natural deduction go or the focus of logic cut back. It's no fun grading natural deduction proofs, and Lean does a better job at teaching formal deduction. </p>
<p>In any case, whatever the role of logic, Rob and Floris and I (and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="372804">@Marcus Rossel</span>) have come to the conclusion that it would be more useful to move from term mode to tactic mode, because (1) the latter are easier to learn, (2) it's easier to build more advanced proofs on that, and (3) it's the norm for mathlib. I don't think it would make a huge difference to the exposition -- instead of telling students to write <code>or.elim h ...</code> we'd tell them to write <code>cases h</code> and instead of writing <code>or.inl</code> they would write <code>left</code>, etc.</p>
<p>One issue that arises is that it was really helpful in the past that students didn't have to install Lean to do the homework assignments, since they could use the browser version of Lean. There currently is no version of Lean 4 that runs in the browser, though we have had success in having students use Lean using Gitpod.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I'll be free from teaching in the spring and I can invest effort in porting L&amp;P to Lean 4 then. If there is anything I can do in the meanwhile that would be helpful, let me know.</p>

<p>Well, <code>cases</code> is reasonably close to "There are two cases to consider. Case one: ... Case two: ..." In general, you want to overall structure of a formal proof to be similar to the structure of an informal proof, and it's not clear to me that it is any harder to approximate it with a tactic proof than with a term proof.</p>

<p>Are you talking about gitpod? GitPod doesn't require Git and can use any library. Or are you commenting on the absence of mathlib in Lean4?</p>

<p>Fair. This was in my mind but was not emphasized. I want to control the environment , as much as possible, students are using so I don't have to deal with setup issues. The web browser version only requires a modern browser to use Lean. </p>
<p>Without it the best option seems to currently be Gitpod. I guess students don't need to know basic git to use it but at this point I would want to tie into a workflow for automatically grading the assignment. For that they need git.</p>

<p>I can confirm that Gitpod is easy with any flavor of Lean. Students get 50 hours free each month, which should be more than enough.</p>

<p>Can you do elementary set theory in Lean 4?  It looks to me like the definitions from Lean 3 in core/init.data.set are not there in Lean 4.  Or am I missing something?  I would think you'd want to do some basic set theory in a proofs course.</p>

<p>They are not there but implementing basic set theory in Lean is quite straight fowrard (and translating the Lean 3 file to Lean 4 by hand would be easy as well)</p>
<p>Basically the only non trivial thing about is is, what is a set and the answer to that is:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">Set</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span> <span class="n">u</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="bp">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Prop</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>and from here you can build everything, e.g.</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">Set.inter</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">A</span> <span class="n">B</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Set</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Set</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="k">fun</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="bp">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="bp">∧</span> <span class="n">B</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>and so on, you of course may want to define additional notation stuff etc. for this as well and also basic API lemmas etc. but all of that is doable right now and doesn't have any dependencies really. Hence we also already have lots of this stuff in mathlib4, specifically here: <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Set#doc">docs4#Set</a></p>

<p>Since GitHub classroom autograding is done purely over stdout, this is enough for me (for this week). But for something like gradescope you want to generate  a json and write that.</p>
<p>I can also imagine it being done via a lake script or using lspec. </p>
<p>I welcome people's thoughts.</p>

<p>In IO, you don't have access to the environment, and a default-created one isn't going to have anything in it, which makes it impossible to find axioms or indeed your student's proof. If you want to run this at compile time, then the <code>#eval</code> approach you have now is fine, but if you want to do it at run time (producing a binary) then you need to call the lean frontend to parse your student's file and query the resulting environment.</p>
