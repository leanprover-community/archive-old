<p>Is the identity monad strict?<br>
Instead of using the identity monad as a base for my transformer I used IO (to debug) and my computation finished instantly...<br>
I'm thinking this is because IO is strict. Is Id not?</p>

<p>Ok, I eliminated the identity monad and performance is the same (poor). Is there anyway to enforce strictness without using IO?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="382349">@Calvin Lee</span> can you elaborate on what you are trying to do? Lean is a strict language, so unlike for example in Haskell, most expressions are strictly evaluated by default.</p>

Yeah, I can say exactly what I'm doing.<br>
So for one of my courses I'm writing a Sudoku solver (in Lean 4). To do this I wrote the <a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/papers/LogicT.pdf">LogicT monad transformer</a> (with some restrictions due to problems with universes/polymorphism)  in Lean and wrote a pretty simple backtracking algorithm using it.<br>
When using the <code>Logic = LogicT Id</code> monad, it is very slow, and will not even be able to solve an empty 3x3 board. However,  <code>LogicT IO</code> is very quick and will evaluate almost instantly</p>

<p>I could post my code here, but I've been hesitant to crowd it with asking for help too much since this channel is devoted to lean4 developments<br>
But I was also told to post here instead of in <a class="stream" data-stream-id="113489" href="/#narrow/stream/113489-new-members">#new members</a></p>

<p>I'm not familiar with that paper, so it is hard to say exactly what is going on. By all means do post your code though, this channel is for Lean 4 <em>users</em> after all.</p>

<p>Because lean uses in-place mutation a lot, you should ensure that your monad combinators are using their values linearly. That seems the most likely culprit when it comes to continuation monads</p>

<p>Hmm, but wouldn't this create a performance issue with both IO and Id?</p>

<p>Logic definitely isn't linear (it duplicates continuations on mplus), but this is necessary for transparent backtracking<br>
But I don't think that's the main issue since it's duplicated for IO as well (since LogicT IO is still backtracking)</p>

<p>So the only thing I'm thinking so far, is that IO is defined with the <code>IO.RealWorld</code> constant that prevents "reordering" of operations.<br>
Does this really affect compilation, or is it just there for future use?</p>

<p>Yes! This seems like the case!<br>
I replaced <code>IO</code> as a base for my monad transformers with <code>StateM Unit</code> and it runs very quickly</p>

<p>You might also get the same result with <code>ReaderM Unit</code>; there is a big difference between <code>A</code> and <code>Unit -&gt; A</code> in order of evaluation, so that seems like the key difference</p>

<p>Yeah, it might be too eager in some places perhaps. I may try experimenting with thunks to see if I can get rid of the performance issue with Id<br>
The LogicT paper was originally written for Haskell with a few extensions.... so I'm sure there are some issues that I don't yet understand about using it in Lean</p>

<p>Yeah this is it spot on<br>
<code>StateM Unit</code> is the same type as <code>Thunk</code> (what I just realized) so all I needed was lazyness and this gave it to me</p>
