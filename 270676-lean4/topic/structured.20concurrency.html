<p>I see there are some concurrency and I/O primitives in Lean4. I haven't digested it yet but I think <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/master/src/Init/System/IO.lean#L101"><code>asTask</code> </a> is sorta like the <code>go</code> statement of <a href="https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/">go statement considered harmful</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/master/src/Init/Core.lean#L114"><code>Task</code></a> is a structured primitive?</p>

<p>I think it is like the <code>go</code> statement but I disagree with the argument that such a primitive should not be exposed to the language. (I don't think that blogger's views are shared by the majority of language designers.) It is possible to build a scoped thread model on top of the task primitives if you want, but as long as they can be safely and purely exposed I don't see any reason to avoid giving users access to the thread spawn function. (Plus <code>asTask</code> isn't even a pure function so that is even less applicable.)</p>

<p>Actually, looking at the lean 4 code a bit more I think there are actually two kinds of tasks represented by the type <code>Task A</code>. One is pure tasks created by <code>Task.mk</code>. The only thing you can do with these tasks is map/bind them and block on them with <code>Task.get</code>, and they are terminated when the task handle is dropped. So the comparison to <code>go</code> is not correct in this case, because they do not outlive the function</p>

<p>The second kind of task is IO tasks created by <code>asTask</code> and manipulated with the other IO task operations like <code>wait</code> and <code>cancel</code>. These do outlive their caller and so act like <code>go</code>, but it is not difficult to set up a scoped thread approach for them as mentioned</p>

<p>that seems a bit backwards to me. The normal case should be structured, so you need to go out of your way, like adding <code> unstructured </code> or at least an annoyingly long name like <code>IO._spawn_task_without_supervision</code> to do the less-disciplined thing. All the old languages have to support old code, and it's not easy to refactor an unsupervised-task application into structured format ("callbacks all the way down") so they provide easy ways to keep existing code running. But new languages can make their normal primitive safer and easier to use. </p>
<p>Fwiw there are some nice testimonials which I treat as anecdotal evidence, a particularly choice one about the Trio structured concurrency library <a href="https://gitter.im/python-trio/general?at=5b53f400e06d7e74099420fb">is from</a> Donald Stufft who runs the Python Package Index <a href="https://pypi.org">https://pypi.org</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've written Linehaul in uh<br>
Twisted, gevent, and asyncio<br>
and now trio<br>
trio is the first one I feel like I can actually follow the code without my head hurting<br>
(and that includes the fact the trio one is also way more configurable and robust, and has retries and everything that none of the others did)</p>

<p>the Haskell <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ki"><code>ki</code></a> library seems to be a better fit for scoped threads in pure functional languages like lean, but I'm not sure the <code>Task</code> primitive is low level enough to support it - one needs to be able to store type erased tasks (i.e. <code>ThreadId</code> in haskell) and be able to cancel tasks using the type erased handle</p>

<p>I haven't tested but you might be able to cheat by casting a <code>Task A</code> to <code>Task Unit</code> and hopefully <code>IO.cancel</code> doesn't care that the types don't match</p>

<p>I would argue it is generally the other way around.  A language primitive should be <strong>primitive</strong>. It should reflect the actual bare-metal implementation as closely as possible. Higher order structures should come later. However, I do agree with your approach of using naming conventions to highlight more primitive operations (Haskell, for example, does this by appending hashtags to its primitive operations).</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that Lean is not a structured imperative language unlike many of the other languages (like Kotlin, Swift, Java, and even Julia to an extent) you mentioned, thus concepts do not necessarily carry over so easily.</p>
