<p>In lean 3, you could use <code>{ foo := bla, ..s }</code> as an alternative to <code>{ s with foo := bla }</code>, which also generalizes to <code>{ foo := bla, ..s, ..t }</code> for splatting multiple structures' fields into one, with other useful things like <code>{..s, ..t}</code> or even <code>{..s}</code> for transforming one structure into another as long as the names of the fields line up. Mathlib uses the <code>..s</code> notation exclusively for these reasons (I almost forgot that <code>s with</code> still works), but it looks like <code>s with</code> is making a comeback in lean 4 and the <code>..s</code> notation is not supported. Is this an intentional omission?</p>

<p>Yes, it is intentional. If users want this Lean 3 notation, they can use the <code>syntax</code> command to define it, and then write an elaboration function for it.</p>
