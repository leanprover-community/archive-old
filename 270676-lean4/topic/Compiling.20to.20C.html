<p>I'd like to compile my program on a host that does not have lean. Is there any way to compile to a C file that I can then compile on that machine?</p>

<p>Is this for cross-compiling? Anyway, when you run <code>leanmake bin</code> on your package, it should tell you exactly what commands the build pipeline is running and which files it's putting where. After that, you probably need to take a closer look at the <code>leanc</code> script and its dependencies (Lean headers, gmp, ...).</p>

<p>Ah I see, so I would have to make sure the lean libraries <code>lib*.a</code> work as well<br>
Unfortunately I'm not doing something so interesting as cross-compiling... For an assignment I am entering a "competition" with my lean program against other people in my class. Unfortunately for this it has to work on a machine with a very old gcc and glibc, so my lean executable and <code>elan</code> cannot run. I think I'll try bootstrapping lean from scratch and see if that works</p>

<p>I wonder whether it would be possible to build lean binaries using Cosmopolitan: <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan">https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan</a> <br>
Then the generated binary could be used in your "old" machine.</p>
