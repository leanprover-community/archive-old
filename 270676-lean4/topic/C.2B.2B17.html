<p>Hi all. Eric F here. I'm on the MSR team, and helping to move the build along into the year 2022. As such, we'd like to move the compilers to all use C++17 so we can use std::thread and some standardized filesystem stuff. This didn't work in the past, but we're pretty sure with the latest OS revisions, this is worth a shot. I've compiled lean on windows, WSL (on windows), and the mac, and run the tests, and so far so good. Any big red flags I should be aware of?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="443382">@Eric Frazer</span> Thanks for doing it! There are two usual caveats that you may already know, but I'll just repeat them here for the sake of completeness:</p>
<ul>
<li>There may be a future where either the Lean runtime or all of Lean is free of C++, so we might not want to move existing filesystem primitives implemented using C APIs to C++ unless there is a specific reason to do so</li>
<li>We have avoided std::thread so far because it does not let us customize the thread stack size</li>
</ul>

<p>Isn't the stack size for new threads the default stack size for the running OS? Is it settable somewhere in the OS settings? I imagine whatever machine is running gigantic Lean proofs is probably somewhat dedicated to that task, and one could set the default stack size?</p>

<p>the code has a lot of switches in it right now for one OS or another. it's somewhat messy. especially the pthread stuff and the file iterator stuff. In an effort to unify the code and getting it looking the same, and then ultimately getting it to compile "the right way" on Windows, it'd be nice to move the C++ code forward into the 21st century and get it reasonably standard. So, why not move it to std::thread, and monkey with the linker thread stack sizes and see what works and what doesn't, and go from there?</p>

<p>if we can set the default thread stack size for the process, even with std::thread, I would imagine this is sufficient. Can't see how a Lean program would want one stack size for one thread, and another for a different thread. Especially since it's simply a reservation, not an actual allocation.</p>
