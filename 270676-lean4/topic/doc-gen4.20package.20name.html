<p>I was helping <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="467926">@Joseph O</span> with his <a href="https://github.com/crabbo-rave/lean4-Hangman">Hangman</a> package and Lean was complaining about a badly formatted <code>lakefile.lean</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="bp">`/</span><span class="n">home</span><span class="bp">/</span><span class="n">arthur</span><span class="bp">/.</span><span class="n">elan</span><span class="bp">/</span><span class="n">toolchains</span><span class="bp">/</span><span class="n">leanprover</span><span class="c1">--lean4---nightly-2022-03-06/bin/lake print-paths Init` failed:</span>

<span class="n">stderr</span><span class="o">:</span>
<span class="n">Error</span> <span class="n">parsing</span> <span class="bp">'./</span><span class="n">lakefile.lean'.</span>  <span class="n">Please</span> <span class="n">restart</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">lean</span> <span class="n">server</span> <span class="n">after</span> <span class="n">fixing</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">Lake</span> <span class="n">configuration</span> <span class="n">file.</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Turns out the error was because he added the <code>doc-gen4</code> dependency named as <code>docgen4</code>. Changing it to <code>«doc-gen4»</code> solved the issue. However, I thought about three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The current doc-gen4 package name with french brackets and a dash isn't very straightforward (just my opinion)</li>
<li>The error message was pretty misleading, making me think there was something wrong with the formatting when the error was just a misspelled package name</li>
<li>Would it be nice if the package name were inferred instead of inputted manually?</li>
</ul>
