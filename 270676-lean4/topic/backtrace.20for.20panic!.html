<p>I've noticed during my development on doc-gen4 that when I commit some logic error in my handling of e.g. <code>HashMap</code>and try to access a key that is not there nailing even the location of the error down (especially when the HashMap is not in the spot I just edited but somewhere else and this error is a side effect of the change I made) is kind of hard due to the fact that <code>panic!</code> only knows about the location it was called it but not actually the entire backtrace. With my current knowledge of Lean I can also see that it's very convenient to have panic work this way because you can just determine this location easily at compile time but I was wondering whether it would be feasible to actually print a full backtrace? This would make my life soooo much easier when I eventually mess up again.</p>

<p>You can always run the program in a debugger and set a breakpoint on <code>lean_panic_fn</code>.</p>

<p>You could also try setting the environment variable <code>LEAN_ABORT_ON_PANIC</code> (on the official nightlies).  I believe libc++ produces backtraces for uncaught exceptions.</p>

<p>I don't think lean has any support for language level backtraces. It would definitely be nice</p>

<p>it's pretty painful to get a backtrace in haskell, it's opt in with a magic typeclass. Not sure if lean would suffer similar issues</p>

<p>Probably a better strategy is just to use the C stack and demangle the names</p>

<p>I think the big issue in Haskell is laziness, the actual stack trace at the time of execution has little relation to nested calls in the source.  In Lean we could indeed look at the C stack (and the interpreter!).</p>

<p>In the interpreter, I guess it's possible to directly produce the backtrace</p>

<p>Typically the interpreter is interleaved with native functions, so ideally you'd want both.</p>

<p>Yeah I kind of expected it's non trivial to acutally do it in lean :/ the Rust backtrace/unwind machinery (its the only other I know) is also kinda complex.</p>

<p>Yeah they do but there is also some degrees of platform specific logic, for example under OpenBSD libunwind does work but for the longest time it would just print "unknown function" n times (for stack depth n) until I fixed it in the unwind wrapper so there is apparently some non trivial piece of platform specific code involved at least in Rust.</p>

<p>Apparently the state of the art is to capture both the native stack as well as the interpreter stack(s) and then merge them.  <a href="https://www.benfrederickson.com/profiling-native-python-extensions-with-py-spy/">https://www.benfrederickson.com/profiling-native-python-extensions-with-py-spy/</a></p>

<p>Use libunwind and add debug information (DWARF) when compiling. This can be done with #line macro in C.</p>
