<p>I have been working for a while on attempts at forward reasoning in Lean 4. I have blogged about the results so far at <a href="https://siddhartha-gadgil.github.io/automating-mathematics/posts/forward-reasoning-in-lean4/">https://siddhartha-gadgil.github.io/automating-mathematics/posts/forward-reasoning-in-lean4/</a> and the code is at <a href="https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/lean-loris">https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/lean-loris</a></p>
<p>Any suggestions are welcome.</p>
