<p>Consider this example:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">example</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="bp">∀</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Nat</span><span class="o">),</span> <span class="bp">¬</span> <span class="bp">∃</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Fin</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">),</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="bp">≠</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="kd">by</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In the tactic state, the goal is shown as <code>ℕ → ¬∃ x, x ≠ x</code>.  I have said before that I don't really like the algorithm that is used to distinguish between "forall" and "if-then," but in this case I'm really puzzled.  I assumed that what was being used was <code>Lean.Expr.isArrow</code>, which checks to see if the body of the <code>forallE</code> has loose bound variables.  Well, in this case the body <em>does</em> have a loose bound variable, namely the reference to <code>n</code> in <code>Fin n</code>.  So why is this displayed using an arrow rather than a universal quantifier?</p>

<p>This is actually a pretty-printing bug... <code>→</code> is always non-dependent, while the specific <code>∀</code> here is dependent.</p>

<p>The following would be a valid use of <code>→</code> by the pretty-printer though:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">#check</span> <span class="bp">∀</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Nat</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="bp">¬∃</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Nat</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="bp">≠</span> <span class="n">x</span>

<p>Ultimately this boils down to the underlying type theory; both implication and forall are represented as <code>Expr.forallE</code>.  So the pretty-printer needs to make a choice whether to show the <code>.forallE</code> as an implication or a forall.</p>

<p>OK, I'll file an issue.<br>
Yes, I understand that implication and forall are both represented as <code>forallE</code>.  In my opinion, the pretty-printer algorithm should be changed.  For an expression <code>forallE name type body binderinfo</code> that has type <code>Prop</code>, I think that if the type of <code>type</code> is not <code>Prop</code> then, even if <code>body</code> has no loose bvars, the expression should be displayed with a universal quantifier.  In logic, it is not uncommon to have "vacuous quantifiers" like <code>∀ x : Nat, p</code>.  I understand that, to Lean, this is the same as <code>Nat → p</code>, but that's not how any mathematician would write it.  For expressions of other types, the current algorithm makes sense.  But if an expression has type <code>Prop</code>, then in my opinion it should be displayed so that it looks like a proposition.  And that means the arrow should mean "implies", and therefore it should only be used if what's on the left is a proposition.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it would be a bit weird to have a nat and then a prop which didn't depend on it ...</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> Sometimes these non-dependent foralls arise incidentally to rewrites (for example, if you have <code>∀ (n : ℕ), 1 ≤ f n</code> and make use of <code>∀ (n : ℕ), f n = 37</code>). I imagine you've had students become confused when their foralls turn into functions. There at least have been occasional questions on <a class="stream" data-stream-id="113489" href="/#narrow/stream/113489-new-members">#new members</a> about this.</p>

<p>I agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="306601">@Kyle Miller</span> that non-dependent foralls arise naturally in math.  They also arise in formal logic.  For example, there is a rule of logic that says that forall distributes over and:  <code>∀ x, P ∧ Q</code> is equivalent to <code>(∀ x, P) ∧ (∀ x, Q)</code>.  One would want to be able to apply this rule even in cases in which <code>P</code> is a statement about <code>x</code> but <code>Q</code> doesn't mention <code>x</code>. It would certainly be awkward to have separate versions of the rule depending on whether both <code>P</code> and <code>Q</code> mention <code>x</code> or only one of them does.</p>
<p>Here's a related point.  Consider this example:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">example</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">p1</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Nat</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="kt">Type</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">p2</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Nat</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="kt">Prop</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">h1</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="bp">∀</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Nat</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">p1</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">h2</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="bp">∀</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Nat</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">p2</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">True</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="kd">by</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In the tactic state, the type of <code>h1</code> is displayed as <code>(n : ℕ) → p1 n</code>, and the type of <code>h2</code> is <code>∀ (n : ℕ), p2 n</code>.  So it appears that there is a precedent for displaying expressions of type <code>Prop</code> differently from expressions of other types.  The difference here makes sense to me: <code>h2</code> is best thought of as a universally quantified statement, but <code>h1</code> is best thought of as a function type.  I think a similar principle applies to the case of <code>∀ n : Nat, p</code>.  If <code>p</code> is a proposition, then this is best thought of as a universally quantified statement (even though <code>p</code> doesn't refer to <code>n</code>), but if <code>p</code> is not a proposition then it makes sense to think of the expression as representing the type <code>Nat → p</code>.</p>
<p>Would there be a down side to making this change?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="453098">@Dan Velleman</span> A couple days ago I experimented with making the change for Lean 3, and it was relatively straightforward. There didn't seem to be any downsides that surfaced through the test suite. (I just uploaded it: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/pull/770">lean#770</a>, and look at in particular <code>pp_forall.lean</code> for some tests.)</p>
