<p>Are there any techniques for dealing with inductive types which contain a large recursion? The issue is that I have an almost acyclic collection of types A ... Z that all build on one another, but A needs to refer to Z, and this causes all the types in between to end up in one giant mutual inductive block, which causes problems for the kernel. I'm considering using <code>unsafe</code> to avoid all the theorem generation because I don't need anything to be verified, I just want long distance mutual recursion like one would find in C / haskell / etc. Lean 4 core has a couple file-spanning mutual recursions, but they generally seem to go via <code>builtin_initialize</code> which isn't available to user code.</p>

<p>oftentimes, what the F# folks do is being parametric in the type you would have to be recursive on otherwise. Maybe that could work for you?</p>

<p>I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="235513">@Daniel Fabian</span>  means something like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">inductive</span> <span class="n">BaseFoo</span> <span class="n">a</span>

<span class="bp">|</span> <span class="n">bar</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">foobar</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">)</span>

<p>which works like the following mutual block:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">mutual</span>

<span class="kd">inductive</span> <span class="n">Foo</span>

<p>I've used this pattern myself in the past. For example, I used it to model LLVM's type hierarchy, which you can see <a href="https://github.com/tydeu/lean4-papyrus/blob/master/Papyrus/IR/Type.lean">here</a> if you want.</p>

<p>What do you mean by okay? I don't think any special checking is going on in the non-<code>mutual</code> example. I know that, at the very least, some of the checking that goes on in a <code>mutual</code> block does not occur, since you can mix structures and inductives with this pattern but you can't do so in <code>mutual</code> blocks.</p>

<p>You've mentioned this before and it has always struck me as odd. As, at the very least, structures support <code>extends</code> which behaves specially in many cases. So, I would not say they are all that identical.</p>

<p>That's weird, because I said, I used this pattern to represent LLVM type hierarchy (i.e. <a href="https://github.com/tydeu/lean4-papyrus/blob/master/Papyrus/IR/Type.lean">here</a>) which had a decent number of different nested inductives and I didn't really notice any overhead. But maybe that wasn't enough nesting?</p>

<p>you should try playing with the nested inductive <a href="https://github.com/dselsam/mathport/blob/master/Mathport/AST3.lean">here</a>.

<p>I do suspect though that the problem may be that <code>mutual</code> blocks have to do a lot more checking because they don't know a priori if the inductives are merely nested or if they are fully mutually recursive.</p>

<p>have you verified this? I'd expect that you can do the check locally for each parametrized inductive as opposed to having to do it for the whole SCC. The fact that you are parametric breaks the loop after all.</p>

<p>According to section 9.4 of di Battista et al., "Graph Drawing: Algorithms for the Visualization of Graphs," this is an NP-complete problem.  They give a greedy linear time algorithm, and they claim it works relatively well for sparse digraphs.  (The formulation of the problem is to find the subset of edges to reverse to form a DAG.)</p>
