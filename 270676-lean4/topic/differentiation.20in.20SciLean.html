<p>I wrote down some text about <a href="https://lecopivo.github.io/SciLean/doc/differentiation_in_scilean.html">differentiation in SciLean</a> it is a rough first draft but some feedback would be welcome. I have described only the core symbolic differentiation and mainly how to use it instead of how it works. Other topics like symbolic variational calculus and automatic differentiation is still work progress even on the code level.</p>
