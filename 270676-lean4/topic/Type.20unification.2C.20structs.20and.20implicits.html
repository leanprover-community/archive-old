<p>Dear all, I'm writing a generic stream library to power a generic megaparsec clone.</p>
<p>My path of dropping the openness ambition took me from multiparameter typeclasses with associated types and associated instances all the way down to having a really closed system where I just offer one stream iterator type per taxonomy of streams and stream-like things, which is highly polymorphic. I don't want to sacrifice polymorphism for a number of reasons, not least of which is that I want to have the same user code to be able to be launched against real world and against some testing monads. So yes, I want my stuff to be polymorphic, but I'm okay for my stuff to be closed, i.e. non-extendable by the user.</p>
<p>However, even my least ambitious attempt failed the moment I've started introducing constraints. Here is a clean, representative example of what I mean: <a href="https://github.com/yatima-inc/straume/blob/cognivore/generic-programming-in-lean-is-pain/Straume/WonkyConstraint.lean#L24">https://github.com/yatima-inc/straume/blob/cognivore/generic-programming-in-lean-is-pain/Straume/WonkyConstraint.lean#L24</a></p>

<p>Ideally, I would like to be able to just say <code>def flipTakeN := fun n x =&gt; takeN x n</code> and <code>def take1 := flipTakeN 1</code> or <code>def take1 := fun x =&gt; takeN x 1</code>.</p>
<p>Note that <code>takeN</code> implementation is replaced by a dummy implementation, just to be sure that there is an implementation for that type.</p>

<p>You say that you don't want to sacrifice polymorphism, but do you definitely need <em>universe</em> polymorphism as well? It's always easier to assume everything is in <code>Type</code> if that works for all your use cases.</p>

<p>That's a tough one! While working on Megaparsec, I sacrificed universe polymorphism, and then there was a higher universe object that I couldn't work into the system without bringing it back. Sadly I don't remember particular details, but I think it was some associated type port.</p>

<p>I was considering sacrificing it yesterday, when I hit this block, but after that experience, I'm kind of scared :)</p>

<p>The current <code>bind</code> constrains you to a single universe anyway, though see also the concurrent thread <a href="#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/universe.20polymorphic.20IO">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/universe.20polymorphic.20IO</a></p>
