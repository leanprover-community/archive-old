<p>I was doing the Advent of Code day 5, and I came across a problem where I would have to iterate a large board and compute something "heavy" for each pair (x, y). To avoid spoilers and simplify the problem, I am just computing if x = y for each position, and counting how many diagonals there are for x and y in [0:10000].  (For those who have done the problem, I know this is not the most efficient approach for the board given, but I don't care right now).</p>
<p>I've implemented three versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>a naive recursive function, which stacks overflow.</li>
<li>a tail recursive function, which is faster</li>
<li>an IO version that uses for _ in [1:100000+1], which is slightly faster than the tail recursive.</li>
</ul>

<p>First of all, props to Leo&amp;Cia for implementing the for in. But I was wondering if there is anyway I can do it without the function having the IO Monad, and if there was a more idiomatic/faster way of doing this.</p>
<p>Another question: is there anything like Haskell's trace for lean4, where we can print things without having to change everything up the stack to be IO?</p>

<p>You should be able to use <code>do</code>, <code>for</code>and <code>let mut</code> even in pure functions. E.g.</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">foo</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Nat</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Nat</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">mut</span> <span class="n">r</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
  <span class="n">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="bp">+</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">r</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">r</span> <span class="bp">*</span> <span class="n">i</span>
  <span class="n">return</span> <span class="n">r</span>

<span class="k">#eval</span> <span class="n">foo</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>dbgTrace</code> and <code>dbgTraceVal</code> are what you're looking for. If you're doing performance debugging, <code>dbgTraceIfShared</code> is also helpful.</p>

<p>Simpler than I thought. Now I went back to the docs to see how to improve them, but I found exactly that solution in sum'. Sorry for bothering with that.</p>
<p>And thanks for the dbgTrace, that's exactly what I was looking for. But since it breaks tail recursion, I can only use it in the base case. But it works wonders in the for-in version! Guess that's the one I'll be using in the future.</p>

<p>One issue with using <code>dbgTrace</code> in <code>for</code> loops is that reassignments below the <code>dbgTrace</code> won't work anymore. I usually just use <code>dbgTraceVal</code> :)</p>

<p><code>dbg_trace</code> should fix that!</p>

<p>True, macros do not show up there... yet. It is, however, mentioned in <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/dev/debugging.html">https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/dev/debugging.html</a> :) .</p>
