<p>I am planning on renaming <code>package.lean</code> to something more generic in preparation for generalizing Lake beyond just building package targets. I also want to do this now, while Lake is in its early stages, when such a change is unlikely to cause much pain.</p>
<p>Currently, the two names I have in mind are the basic<code>lakefie.lean</code> and the more thematic, but esoteric <code>watershed.lean</code>. I am also considering using the later name instead for an eventual lockfile for Lake (i.e., <code>watershed.json</code> would instead be the JSON lockfile).  I would like to know what name the Lean community would prefer. Alternatively, if anyone has another idea for a name feel free to suggest it!</p>

<p>Why <code>lakefie</code>? Or did you mean <code>lakefile</code>?</p>

<p>I think that <code>watershed.lean</code> is too "clever". I would never know that it is a package configuration and would think it is a source file in the project. <code>lakefile.lean</code> is more likely to be connected to "makefile".</p>

<p>Also, is it lowercase on purpose? Most lean files have capital names, and <code>Makefile</code> is also traditionally capitalized</p>

<p>It should be named after what it is supposed to describe. It could use a metaphor to do so (cargo, crate, ...), but I think lake does not necessarily lend itself well to elaborate metaphors (port, harbour, marina, ...?). Something like workspace.lean would make sense if the result of invoking lake would be a working setup potentially consisting of several packages, which all are build and made available for working in VSCode. Otherwise build.lean and setup.lean would come to mind.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="315577">@Mac</span> I don't have any immediate association of watershed related to packaging / building, the rust ecosystem is clever in that sense because they have a whole industrial metaphor going on.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="130511">@Christian Pehle</span> really? I would never consider Rust's metaphors intuitive -- in the sense that I would naturally relate them to the relevant concepts in software packaging. They are cute/clever though. As such, I think Ruby's gem metaphors (gem, facet, etc.) -- which are not remotely connected to physical packaging -- work just as well.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was already leaning towards the more generic <code>lakefile.lean</code> and this discussion seems to be heading in that direction. Is that a fair assessment?</p>

<p>I did a git clone of the Lean4 source. I followed the build instructions in the Lean manual. The build stopped with errors at stage1. I have a console log. Where / How should I post it?</p>
