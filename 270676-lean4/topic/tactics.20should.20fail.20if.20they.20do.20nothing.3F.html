<p>I know this has been discussed before, but I'm not sure that a decision was reached. In Lean 3 we had the convention that tactics should fail rather than succeed having achieved nothing. In particular both <code>ext</code> and <code>simp</code> had this behaviour, and in both cases they have changed in Lean 4.</p>

<p>I would love to return to the convention that tactics should fail. I think it's easier for humans, and easier for writing more complicated tactics that use these as building blocks.</p>

<p>Yes please! Any search tactic generally wants to treat "no-op" as "failure", and it's much easier to turn a failure into a no-op than to check whether a success was in fact a no-op.</p>

<p>What if you want to distinguish "this tactic found nothing to match against" vs "this tactic crashed while processing the thing it matched against". I think failure on no-op is good for interactive tactics, but probably a bad idea for non-interactive tactics</p>

It is more readable to do something with a <code>TacticM Bool</code> or <code>TacticM (Option _)</code> than to call a <code>TacticM Unit</code> and use <code>try-catch</code> for control flow.</p>

<p>How about throwing a <del>error</del> warning on a no-op for an interactive tactic? I want _something_ to tell me about a no-op but can understand the argument that a no-op is not failure.</p>

<p>I think we're in furious agreement that interactive tactics should fail rather than no-op, and non-interactive tactic may fail if they find nothing to do, but it's generally more useful to return something.</p>

<p>as a workaround, while not as good as having more useful return types, one thing you can do is something like a <code>progress</code> tactic that fails if no progress is made.

<p>That certainly takes the burden off tactics to try and track whether they had any effect, but presumably is less efficient as a result</p>

<p>But I guess <code>progress</code> would also fail on <code>rw [foo, &lt;-foo]</code>, which is probably a more useful behavior anyway</p>
