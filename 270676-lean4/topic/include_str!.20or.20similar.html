<p>For doc-gen4 I'd like to be able to statically include e.g. the content of a CSS file into my program so I can just output the CSS into a directory the user wants instead of having to carry it around all the time. In Rust we have <code>include_str!</code> for this which basically loads a string from a file at compile time...Now I'm guessing this would be possible with a macro somehow? But maybe there is an even nicer way? Would somebody happen to know?</p>
