<p>Hi people. I'm completely new to lean and I thought I'd try out lean 4 since it's the latest and greatest version. The first thing I've tried to do is define a pair of mutually-inductive types. However I can't figure out the syntax. The examples I've found online don't work (presumably because they're for older versions) and the relevant page of the documentation just says "TODO".</p>
<p>This is my code:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">mutual</span>
  <span class="kd">inductive</span> <span class="n">Ctx</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span> <span class="n">where</span>
    <span class="bp">|</span> <span class="n">CRoot</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Ctx</span>
    <span class="bp">|</span> <span class="n">CCons</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">parent</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Ctx</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="bp">-&gt;</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Ty</span> <span class="n">parent</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="bp">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">Ctx</span>
  <span class="kd">inductive</span> <span class="n">Ty</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Ctx</span> <span class="bp">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Type</span> <span class="n">where</span>
<span class="kd">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Obviously this is wrong (somehow), but hopefully it's clear what I'm trying to do. Can someone show me the correct way to write this? Right now I just get "error: unknown identifier 'Ctx'" (referring to <code>Ty : Ctx -&gt; Type</code>).</p>

<p>If you are new to Lean, you should be using Lean 3 instead because many important features are not yet implemented in Lean 4. Also, there might be endgame bugs (<a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/stream/270676-lean4/topic/Contradiction.3F.html">such as this</a>) that are not yet known.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="270523">@Huỳnh Trần Khanh</span> Ah thanks. Maybe I'll try lean 3 instead then ...</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span> ... or maybe not. Damn. So I gather it's not possible to express this in Lean 3 either then? I'm giving lean a shot because agda is getting on my nerves, but I definitely need inductive-inductive types since I'm trying to formalize a type theory.</p>

<p>Lean 3 doesn't have inductive-inductive types either. I'm using Agda besides Lean as well, and I think it's still ahead when it comes to type theory formalizations. Lean also doesn't have a definitional eta rule for record types, which makes some things more difficult, too.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110789">@Jakob von Raumer</span> Thanks, I'll just go back to Agda then.</p>
<p>I have a few complaints but the things that made me want to give up on it today are:<br>
    (a) Having to repeat myself ad-nauseam when writing functions that take a lot of arguments and have a lot of cases.<br>
    (b) Those function no longer type-checking when I add a new case, with the error pointing at a case that was already type-checking.<br>
    (c) Errors of the form <code>such-and-such != such-and-such when checking ...</code> where "<code>such-and-such</code>" and "<code>such-and-such</code>" are identical.<br>
    (d) Automatic proof search not being able to finds proofs that are completely trivial. eg. where the proof term is something like <code>Set</code>.</p>
<p>But I'll keep working around these things I guess :/</p>

<p>I heard from an Agda user that Agda is (amongst other things) a type theory playground, where people do experiments with exotic types, and occasional proofs of false are not really considered harmful, they are rather considered as useful data about what we can get away with.</p>

<p>From a programming or math formalization standpoint, I personally wouldn't worry too much about inconsistencies in Lean or Agda if you are getting started with either system.  There was some interesting discussion within the SMT community last summer related to this.<br>
If you have proven a major result  that's going to attract press attention or a critical system depends on the proof being right, that may be a different story, but even then I think there are a many other factors that come into play.. e.g, did you get the theorem(s) and all supporting definitions right?  are there other properties you also need to prove to have the assurance you need?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="390108">@Andrew Cann</span> Could you give a more elaborated example of what you need inductive-inductive types for? Just how complicated is your type theory that it requires this? I'm always interested in collecting examples of exotic inductive types, and to see whether they can be simplified to work without needing large cardinals.</p>

<p>It's now kind of proven [1] that all finitary IITs can be reduced to mutual induction, where "finitary" means we can't have something like a pi-type ranging over Lean's <code>Nat</code> in the modelled language. Once you want to quotient at the time of definition you usually need QIITs, which are not assumed to be reducible to mutual induction + quotients (unless you accept noncomputability due to postulating AC).<br>

<p>Yes, once you use sized types, I do think they need a special flag to properly check.</p>

<p>I think that while inconsistencies in a theorem prover are not that important, what is important is seeing how severe of a bug the language developers consider it. Lean has a very good track record in this regard: The developers have always said that consistency bugs are of the highest priority, and no such bug has been discovered since lean 0.1, except for the one recent issue in lean 4 which was in fact dealt with promptly.</p>
<p>Rust is another example of a language that takes soundness bugs seriously, and are willing to break stability guarantees in order to fix soundness problems.</p>
<p>Agda seems to have a more standard programming language model where soundness bugs aren't that big of a deal and backwards compatibility is, if not more important, at least of similar priority, and so soundness bugs can languish. Personally I don't think I would trust a system with such a laissez-faire attitude to soundness bugs for theorem proving for anything I actually care about, although that's not necessarily a problem for a "type theory experimentation" system like Agda.</p>

<p>@Andrew Cann Could you give a more elaborated example of what you need inductive-inductive types for? Just how complicated is your type theory that it requires this? I'm always interested in collecting examples of exotic inductive types, and to see whether they can be simplified to work without needing large cardinals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> I'm trying to formalize a dependent type theory. So my type of types needs to take a context as an argument, but contexts also need to contains types. Pretty much what I wrote in my example, except obviously my real <code>Ty</code> type would have some constructors.</p>

<p>depending on your answer it might be possible to do this in lean despite the lack of direct support</p>

<p>The problem with Agda's inconsistency is that the <code>--safe</code> flag, which is supposed to be the consistent subset, still allows the inconsistent <code>--sized-types</code>. And the inconsistency isn't even some obscure corner case, it's pretty much baked into the design. With that said, you can disable sized types to get a language with no known inconsistencies. Agda's track record is otherwise similar to Coq's: a few inconsistencies that have been swiftly addressed.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="390108">@Andrew Cann</span> have you considered an extrinsically-typed formalisation of your language? I feel like intrinsic typing is generally a trap because you end up needing all these fancy constructions just to avoid a moderate amount of boilerplate.</p>

<p>Hey everyone, I was pointed to this conversation by a colleague. It's true that the ongoing problems with sized types are very unfortunate, but that doesn't mean we don't care about safety. In fact for the next release we've decided to no longer allow <code>--sized-types</code> under <code>--safe</code> (admittedly much too late). In other cases we have definitely prioritized soundness over backwards compatability.</p>

    (a) Having to repeat myself ad-nauseam when writing functions that take a lot of arguments and have a lot of cases.<br>
    (b) Those function no longer type-checking when I add a new case, with the error pointing at a case that was already type-checking.<br>
    (c) Errors of the form <code>such-and-such != such-and-such when checking ...</code> where "<code>such-and-such</code>" and "<code>such-and-such</code>" are identical.<br>
    (d) Automatic proof search not being able to finds proofs that are completely trivial. eg. where the proof term is something like <code>Set</code>.</p>

<p>If you have concrete examples of these it would be very nice if you could report them (on github or on the agda zulip). We've especially tried to get rid of all problems of kind c), so if there's any of those left it would be good to fix them ASAP.</p>
