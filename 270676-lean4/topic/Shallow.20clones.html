<p><code>leanpkg</code> does not shallow clone dependencies, which means cloning mathlib as a dependency can be slower than it needs to be. Presumably it's not worth changing that, but is it worth considering for Lake?</p>
<p>Newish versions of git support doing this in ways that do not require looping (in case the commit requested is not a branch HEAD -- see e.g. <a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/68ee628932c2196742b77d2961c5e16360734a62">here</a> though not all git servers support it yet -- if a server didn't, ISTM it may be worth considering doing a clone with depth 5 or something and then falling back to full clone if it doesn't have the right commit)</p>
