<p>Currently in <code>src/Lean/Elab/Tactic/Simp.lean</code> the definition <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/c2a5e37/src/Lean/Elab/Tactic/Simp.lean#L221"><code>evalSimp</code></a> is doing two different types of work:</p>
<ol>
<li>munging the tactic <code>Syntax</code> to extract arguments</li>
<li>delegating to other lower level tactics based on the form of the <code>location</code> argument extracted from the <code>Syntax</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'd prefer if these were separate, in particular so that in another tactic I can run the simplifier by specifying a <code>location</code>. As <code>evalSimp</code> is currently written, I'd either have to reproduce most of its logic, or synthesize a <code>Syntax</code> expression in order to actually use <code>evalSimp</code>.</p>
<p>Is it reasonable to want this separation? Perhaps I'm not yet used to "the Lean 4 way"!</p>

<p>the "lean 4 way" seems to be to construct syntax to run the tactic frontend. I'm also not particularly happy with this state of affairs</p>

<p>similar observations also apply to most command parsers, they parse their syntax and delegate right away, so you can't really run them unless you have a syntax, it's not like lean 3 where there is a backend tactic that takes exprs and such</p>

<p>The local reason I wanted this was experimenting with porting <code>split_ifs</code>. Part of <code>split_ifs</code> delegates to <code>simp only [if_pos, if_neg, dif_pos, dif_neg]</code> along with a <code>discharger</code>.</p>
<p>It is set up so that that list of lemmas is obtained from an attribute. The "syntactical" <code>simp</code> tactic in Lean 4 implemented by <code>evalSimp</code> doesn't support passing lemmas by attribute. It seems like it would be quite unpleasant to synthesize a <code>Syntax</code> after you've done whatever work is required to assemble the list of lemmas.</p>

<p>The alternative would be to directly call the underlying tactics in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/c2a5e37c60cefb2d9dab293ee695f85659e1ad72/src/Lean/Meta/Tactic/Simp/Main.lean"><code>src/Lean/Meta/Tactic/Simp/Main.lean</code></a> but none of those are set up to deal with <code>location</code> already (whereas <code>evalSimp</code> has the logic).</p>

<p>Hence my desire to separate the code the deals with <code>Syntax</code> and the code the deals with <code>location</code>.</p>

<p>+1. I've copy-pasted a few definitions because I don't want to bother constructing <code>Syntax</code> for what should be a function call. If this sort of refactoring is wanted, I'd be happy to do (some of) it.</p>
