<p>I want to define notation <code>∈</code>. I don't know how to find out if this is defined already in Lean 4 -- <code>#print notation +</code> doesn't work and <code>+</code> is certainly defined . My instinct is to look at how other notation is defined but I don't know how to jump to definition.</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">#check</span> <span class="n">Add.add</span> <span class="mi">5</span>
<span class="k">#check</span> <span class="mi">5</span> <span class="bp">+</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>both work, but I can't right click on them. I literally have no idea where the core Lean files are on my system (Ubuntu 18.04, stable installed via elan, no nix). Maybe I'll just browse the Lean 4 repo on github but it would be good if I knew how to verify if <code>∈</code> was defined -- I assume it's not, but <code>#check 5 ∈ </code> just gives me two "expected term" errors and I don't know what this means.</p>
