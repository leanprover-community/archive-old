<p>Having learned the hard way that Monads are critical to understanding Lean (and Lake) I've decided to port <a href="https://mmhaskell.com/monads/">https://mmhaskell.com/monads/</a> to Lean, both to learn more about monads myself, and because folks have indicated this is a good place to start.  I've started here: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/1505">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/1505</a> and I'd love the following feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li>what is missing that Lean adds specifically to this story</li>
<li>please add PR comments if you find errors, and/or have suggestions on how to improve the specifics about Lean.<br>
In the PR you can use this to get a new markdown rendering:<br>

<p>A few remarks:<br>
Functors:</p>
<ul>
<li>"In this Functor, map is called a "higher order function" because it takes a function as input (α → β) and returns another function as output F α → F β" You are saying "in this Functor, map is called a HOF" but map is always a HOF so you might instead want to say "<a href="http://Functor.map">Functor.map</a> is called a HOF". </li>
<li>You also only use the HOF term once in this chapter (namely here) so it's just a term being thrown at the reader for no apparent purpose (although quite an important one in functional programming of course)</li>
<li>It should be noted that <code>mapConst</code> has a default implementation, namely: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/0925051c51e183a0b8c504ae53f5cab0525d6cac/src/Init/Prelude.lean#L2592">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/0925051c51e183a0b8c504ae53f5cab0525d6cac/src/Init/Prelude.lean#L2592</a> it is in the type class because some Functors might have a more specialized variant than this which is more performant so we don't want to force all functors on one unspecialized one</li>
<li>You sort of tease the Functor laws but just leave it hanging there, I'd say at least a link to the laws chapter would be nice here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applicatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>why is the little tangent on custom Lean notation for <code>&lt;$&gt;</code> in the applicative chapter? if at all i would have expected it in the functor one since its doing stuff with <a href="http://Functor.map">Functor.map</a>?</li>
<li>generally there is an inconsistency between what you put in backticks sometimes Option and Applicative appear with/without them changing throughout the text</li>
<li>there is a link to the applicative laws at Lazy Evaluation but it leads no where, I assume you pushed that into the general Law chapter?</li>
</ul>
<p>Monads:</p>
<ul>
<li>At least in emacs you can write the ← with a \l, one letter saved \o/</li>
<li>You're claiming that the  ← operator is special but it is in fact not at all special, it desugars into a simple application of &gt;&gt;=, your example code:</li>
</ul>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">runOptionFuncsDo</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">input</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">String</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Option</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">List</span> <span class="n">Nat</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="bp">←</span> <span class="n">optionFunc1</span> <span class="n">input</span>
  <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="bp">←</span> <span class="n">optionFunc2</span> <span class="n">i</span>
  <span class="n">optionFunc3</span> <span class="n">f</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>will be compiled into something like:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">optionFunc1</span> <span class="n">input</span> <span class="bp">&gt;&gt;=</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="k">fun</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="bp">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">optionFunc2</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="bp">&gt;&gt;=</span> <span class="k">fun</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="bp">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">optionFunc3</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>as you can see a straight forward translation from <code>let varName &lt;- foo;../</code> to <code>foo &gt;&gt;= fun varName =&gt; ...</code></p>
<p>Reader:</p>
<ul>
<li>here you suddenly begin using the <code>return</code> keyword without having introduced it or its relationship to <code>pure</code> before. Note that unlike in haskell there is actually a semantic difference between <code>return</code> and <code>pure</code> in Lean, first <code>return</code> is a special keyword so I can write <code>return f x</code> and it will be parsed as <code>return (f x)</code> while <code>pure f x</code> gets parsed as <code>(pure f) x</code> so you usually have to put in a <code>pure &lt;| f x</code>, furthermore <code>return</code> will also cause an early return in a monadic function like in an imperative language while <code>pure</code> will not. </li>
<li>you close with saying: <code>Now it's time to move on to State Monad which is like a ReaderM that is also updatable.</code> this is not the difference between <code>ReaderM</code> and <code>StateM</code> though as you already know, <code>ReaderM</code> is merely a function from the implicit state to the result type, nothing is preventing me from changing the input to this function in a sub part of my program, that is if a have a computaiton that executes three functions <code>f1</code>, <code>f2</code> and <code>f3</code> in the <code>ReaderM</code> Monad I can of course easily pass a custom context to say <code>f2</code> and execute the other two with the one I got from further up. This is can be done in a nice way using the <code>withReader</code> function. The key difference between <code>ReaderM</code> and <code>StateM</code> is in <code>ReaderM</code> what one computation does with the context does not involve computations that come after it, that is if I have a computation that uses <code>withReader</code> to modify the context the next computation will work with the old context again. This is different with the <code>StateM</code> monad where calling a function can actually have an effect on computations that are performed after the one I just called because state changes are propagated further through the additional hidden return parameter.</li>
</ul>
<p>State:</p>
<ul>
<li>since you didnt know about the <code>withReader</code> the explanation of the difference is slightly wrong here as well of course</li>
</ul>
<p>Monad lifting:</p>
<ul>
<li>s/transative/transitive</li>
<li>you mention <code>MonadLiftT</code> in the paragraph above the one about transitive lifting where you explain what <code>MonadLiftT</code> does, this might seem like a typo the the reader at first, though I do not know from the top of my head how to do this better</li>
<li>you also mention that the reader can uncomment the <code>set_option</code> but I dont see (and my C-f doesn't find) a <code>set_option</code>?</li>
</ul>
<p>Laws:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the functor laws I can also give you an example for why you need both laws to hold:</li>
</ul>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">bad_fmap</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">α</span> <span class="n">β</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span> <span class="n">u</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">α</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">β</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">Maybe</span> <span class="n">α</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">Maybe</span> <span class="n">β</span>
<span class="bp">|</span> <span class="n">_</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">_</span> <span class="bp">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">none</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>this will fail the id law but obey the composition law, I dont have such a nice example for an applicative though.</p>
<ul>
<li>you might want to show our <code>LawfulMonad</code> etc. typeclasses as well</li>
</ul>
<p>But overall these are just (partially stylistic) nitpicks, I think it's well done in general <span aria-label="thumbs up" class="emoji emoji-1f44d" role="img" title="thumbs up">:thumbs_up:</span></p>

<p>Thanks for the quick review! Most of the language came straight from <a href="https://mmhaskell.com/monads/tutorial">https://mmhaskell.com/monads/tutorial</a>  so most of the credit goes to them.  The trick is finding places where Lean is different, so thanks for your help on that.</p>

<p>I think "In this Functor, map" is pretty clear and means the same thing as "<a href="http://Functor.map">Functor.map</a>". Am I missing something?</p>

<p>One thing I wasn't sure about in the original Haskell language is the use of the term "structures", I find this a bit confusing in Lean because lean has a special "structure" type.  Is there something I should use instead?  "type classes" perhaps?</p>

<p>I would avoid the acronym HOF, we basically never use it. HO for higher order is used occasionally but I think it's fine just to use "higher order function" without abbreviation in this context</p>

</blockquote>
<p>How's this?</p>
<h2>StateM vs ReaderM</h2>
<p>While <code>ReaderM</code> functions can use <code>withReader</code> to modify the state before calling another function, <code>StateM</code> functions are a little more powerful, let's look at this function again:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">nextTurn</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">StateM</span> <span class="n">GameState</span> <span class="n">Bool</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="bp">←</span> <span class="n">chooseRandomMove</span>
  <span class="n">applyMove</span> <span class="n">i</span>
  <span class="n">isGameDone</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In this function <code>chooseRandomMove</code> is modifying the state that <code>applyMove</code> is getting and <code>chooseRandomMove</code> knows nothing about <code>applyMove</code>.  So <code>StateM</code> functions can have this kind of downstream effect outside their own scope, whereas, <code>withReader</code> cannot do that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm still using the simpler language to introduce <code>StateM</code> because simple is good, and I added this later on in the State docs where more advanced topics are discussed.</p>

<p>It is looking good. <br>
Could you please remove comments containing the output of <code>#eval</code> commands? <br>

<p>Ooh, can we talk about that?  The LeanInk hover tips are great, but I find them a bit tedious on pages like this where there are hundreds of little bubbles.  I think it reads more smoothly when they are always visible.  Perhaps we should change leanInk to add the always visible comments automatically?</p>

<p>I like the comments too. When I was reading the text I even thought to myself that adding the comments there is smart as constantly clicking on the bubbles was disruptive to my reading.</p>

<p>It's also a style I saw a lot in <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/interacting_with_lean.html">TPIL</a> and also grew to really like.</p>

<p>It's also a good double check, if you don't see this value then something is wrong in your vscode setup :-)  Perhaps LeanInk could also verify the comments and spit out errors if what it gets doesn't match the comment :-)</p>

<p>This makes sense for the reader, but it should be done by LeanInk. That is, we should add an option to LeanInk.<br>
Information that can be synthesized should not be written manually. We hope all documentation in the future will be powered by LeanInk and doc-gen4.</p>

<p>TPIL was written many years ago before we had LeanInk.</p>

<p>I agree, can I make that a separate work item though?  I would prefer to do what David is doing which is document in the file the "expected value" which is then reported as an error by LeanInk, which helps catch many little breaking changes in the book content as Lean evolves... I captured the idea here: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/LeanInk/issues/29">https://github.com/leanprover/LeanInk/issues/29</a>.</p>

<p>While I have your attention, one other thing I wasn't sure about in the original Haskell language is the use of the term "structures", I find this a bit confusing in Lean because lean has a special "structure" type. Is there something I should use instead? "type classes" perhaps?  But better would be a is a term that encompasses Functors, Applicatives and Monads?  Perhaps from Category Theory I should call them "morphisms" ?</p>
