<p>When I move a definition from one Lean file to another that imports it in VSCode, I find I have to restart the server for it to find the definition.</p>
<p>Is this expected behavior?</p>

<p>For definitions in the same file, you should never need to restart. For changes in an imported module <code>A</code> (including the locations of symbols one may jump to) to be observable in a module <code>B</code> that imports <code>A</code>, you  need to execute the "Lean 4: Refresh File Dependencies" command in <code>B</code>. Does this help?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="128280">@Wojciech Nawrocki</span> Thanks, I somehow overlooked your reply.  I'll try the refresh file dependencies command. <br>
At least on the Mac, I've gotten into the habit of frequently restarting  Lean and reloading the Window (Does Lean restart when I reload the window?).  Otherwise, I can run into massive slowdowns that necessitate a reboot  It seems to be more of a problem in a devcontainer.  At one point it seemed like VSCode kept spawning Lean processes.<br>
I may be out of date with respect to the Lean VSCode extension, but if this is completely unexpected I can try to find a way to reproduce issues.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110994">@Joe Hendrix</span>  Yeah, I think the whole server should restart when VSCode is reloaded. But there is also a <code>Lean 4: Restart Server</code> command.</p>

<p>The server is meant to spawn a worker process for each open file, but these processes should close when you close the file tab so the total running process count should be the number of open tabs + 1 (for the main process). If it's not that, then it's an issue. Also a worker process sleeps until there is something to be done, though it will initially compile the file on open. This could cause a significant slowdown if a lot of files are suddenly opened, but it shouldn't persist.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="128280">@Wojciech Nawrocki</span> In the case I'm thinking of I had a little over 3000 lean instances running before I killed docker (and less than 10 Lean files open).   I'll try to generate a useful error report if I encounter the issue again.</p>

<p>That's definitely a bug! And yeah, if it happens again a report (maybe noting the particular container image in case its specifics break something) would be useful.</p>

<p>I wonder if this is the same problem that I regularly run into. For me, it is <code>leanpkg</code> running amok on Ubuntu, and respawning new processes faster than they finish. Sometimes this happens suddenly after an hour, sometimes in intervals of a minute or so. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to reproduce it, though I've noticed that Copy&amp;Paste seems to be involved nearly every time it happens. Here's a screenshot: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/XJjUyhE.png">https://i.imgur.com/XJjUyhE.png</a>. If I manage to reproduce it reliably in some way, I'll file a bug report.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="198266">@Sebastian Reichelt</span> It may be.  It happened to me this morning, and I noticed a mix of <code>leanpkg</code> and <code>lean</code> in the OSX Activity Monitor.   So far it's pretty irregular, and I haven't reproduced it.</p>

<p>I've found out that it's triggered by Ctrl+hover (without clicking). That's why I thought it was copy&amp;paste - pressing Ctrl is sufficient if the mouse is in a bad spot. Actually, now I can reproduce it in a very minimal file, so I wonder if there are any necessary conditions.</p>
