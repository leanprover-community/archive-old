<p>I've just stumbled upon a new simp feature:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">example</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">42</span> <span class="bp">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="bp">^</span><span class="mi">100</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="kd">by</span> <span class="n">simp</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Interestingly, <code>42 &lt; 10^1000</code> is no longer provable by simp.</p>
<div class="spoiler-block"><div class="spoiler-header">
</div><div class="spoiler-content" aria-hidden="true">
<p>Simp now tries to simplify every closed subterm <code>p : Prop</code> by synthesizing an instance <code>Decidable p</code> and <em>reducing</em> the decidable instance.  There seems to be some timeout built in because it only works up to some small size, but <code>grep Heartbeat</code> doesn't turn up anything relevant.</p>
</div></div>

<p>I hope this is something we can disable with a simp configuration option? It looks useful for many small things though.</p>

<p>It can be disabled with <code>decide := ff</code>.  I agree, this feature seems useful mostly for small demos (e.g. being able to simplify <code>10 &lt; 42</code> out of the box) but I'm afraid it will cause real performance issues.  For example, when it sees <code>isTaut (pigeonholePrinciple 7 6)</code> or unfolds noncomputable functions.</p>

<p>On the other hand it won't do anything about <code>x &lt; 10 * 42</code> which should be simplified to <code>x &lt; 420</code> (the often requested integration of normNum into simp).</p>

<p>We have a <code>checkMaxHeartbeats</code> and <code>withIncRecDepth</code> at <code>whnfImp</code>.<br>
It fails because the maximum recursion depth has been reached. </p>
<p>We will eventually have better support for arithmetic that simplifies this kind of proposition without relying on <code>whnf</code>. </p>

<p>If there are serious performance problems in practice, we can set the default to <code>decide := false</code>.<br>
Some random thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the feature is useful and it is handy because it works for any decidable proposition. </li>
<li>It is not clear to me how often we will hit examples such as <code>isTaut (pigeonholePrinciple 7 6)</code>. I am assuming new users will not, and advanced users may set <code>decide := false</code>. Not sure.</li>
<li>Regarding non-computable functions, we can block them from being unfolded when we execute <code>whnf</code> at <code>decide</code>.</li>
<li>We can also dramatically reduce the maximum number of heartbeats for this <code>whnf</code>, and produce a nice trace message when it is reached. </li>
<li>We can also report whether a lot of time is spent in these <code>whnf</code> calls, and suggest <code>decide := false</code> to users.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Ah that's what's happening!  I blindly assumed that we had special support for <code>Nat.pow</code> (like we have for +/-/*///%/...).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will eventually have better support for arithmetic that simplifies this kind of proposition without relying on whnf.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a good plan.  Users are often asking for this feature; in mathlib we have a norm_num tactic which essentially does <code>simp; evaluate_arithmetic_expressions</code> and it's used <em>heavily</em>.</p>
