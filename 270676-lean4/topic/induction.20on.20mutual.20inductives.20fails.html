<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110789">@Jakob von Raumer</span> Yes, the current induction tactic does not support mutually inductive types. Note that <code>cases</code> supports them.<br>
The key issue is that the <code>induction</code> tactic uses the <code>A0.rec</code> recursor, and it has multiple motives. The current <code>induction</code> tactic supports only recursors with one motive. This is why <code>cases</code> works, <code>A0.casesOn</code> has a single motive.<br>
That being said, I will add a better error message.</p>

Even if we add it, you will still need to provide the other motives. The tactic <code>induction a</code> would only infer the motive corresponding to <code>A0</code>.</p>

<p>Yes, it is. My point was that if we are already willing to provide the other motives, then providing an extra one is not that big of a deal. That is, the user is already aware of what motives are, and how they work. If feels like that the induction tactic would be a minor improvement over </p>

<p>I think setting the others to <code>PUnit</code> would only work on simple cases. For example, the types in the mutual block are not really recursive, but in this case, we could use <code>cases</code> instead.</p>

<p>True, however, I think from a readability/aesthetic perspective even <code>induction c (motive_1 := ...) ... (motive_n := ...)</code> (or the like) is much cleaner. It allows readers of the code to get a handle on what's going on (i.e., induction) even if they don't fully understand what motives are. It also removes the need to specify <code>C.recOn</code>, which may be annoying and space consuming depending upon how long a name <code>C</code> is (and may also be confusing to more novice readers).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="315577">@Mac</span>  I am not disputing whether it is more readable and/or cleaner. My main point was to justify why this feature is a low-priority right now. We have a huge list of higher priority issues to address. Moreover, this feature is not needed to port Mathlib.</p>

<p>Fwiw, I think <code>induction c (motive_1 := ...)</code> would be the wrong abstraction level anyway. In Isabelle, mutual induction is done over a meta-level conjunction of an appropriate number of goals, as well as an appropriately sized list of induction variables, from which the motives can be derived (if Isabelle even does something like that). We don't have meta-level conjunctions (except for the list of open goals, but I don't think <code>induction</code> working on more than the main goal would be ergonomic), but regular ones seem fine as well.</p>

<p>If the user is willing to provide the different goals, then I think <code>let rec</code> is a good solution for Lean. <br>
It already works in tactic mode, and we will have support for mutual recursion as soon as we have: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/176">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/176</a></p>
