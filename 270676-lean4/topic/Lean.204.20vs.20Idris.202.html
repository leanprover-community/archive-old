<p>Having used Idris for a while, a couple of differences I feel:</p>
<ul>
<li>The goal of Idris is systems programming, so the book, examples etc are aimed at this. Lean 4 is used for mathematics among other things.</li>
<li>Lean has many powerful tactics for proving theorems. As I understand Idris is more aimed at "theorems" about correctness of low level software, so these are not a priority (or available).</li>
<li>A couple of things I like about Idris missing I believe so far in Lean:<br>
    - the hole-filling interface.<br>
    - splitting off a definition<br>
    - breaking a variable being in an inductive type into cases via a keyboard shortcut.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's been a few years, so this is likely out of date. But the <a href="https://idris2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html">official Idris tutorial</a> is fine if you already know Haskell or Lean, and easier if you know some dependent types. To get a sense of the feeling of using it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7uSsL8r_mU">this video</a> is a reasonable place to start - try to do the things he's doing. For Agda, I learned by osmosis from others before the current crop of books, but I've heard good things about <a href="https://plfa.inf.ed.ac.uk/">PLFA</a>.</p>

<p>I'm currently working through <a href="https://plfa.github.io/">PLFA</a>, and it's been a lot of fun.  The first few pages walk through the editor support,  so you wouldn't need to go through the whole thing. But the material has been interesting so far.  (It looks like Wadler has <a href="https://github.com/plfa/plfl">started to translate it to lean</a>.)</p>

<p>As the author of the Idris <code>Elab</code> monad, I agree that Lean 3's was an improvement over my work, and that Lean 4 is even better. But I think that the snide dismissive attitude that some Lean users express towards other systems, rather than a curious and interested one, is not conducive to the development of the field, nor to the development of Lean.</p>

<p>I just saw it was 2017... In any case, my recollection is that most of the good ideas were in fact independently invented, because neither of us really knew about each other until the fundamentals were already in place, but the Lean 3 design and execution was better than mine was.</p>

<p>They're certainly shaped by different constraints and approaches - my Idris 1 metaprogramming work was really intended to be used more like Template Haskell is (automated codegen at compile time), rather than like Lean 3's (which was a tactic language). The Lean 4 stuff nicely subsumes both, as well as having some of the nice things from Racket</p>

<p>I was very guilty of tribalism in the early stages of Lean 3 and got into some trouble over it. Now my thoughts are almost exactly the opposite -- I would love to see other ITP communities trying to do what we are doing with mathlib but because they are far more dominated by computer scientists I've found it hard to drum up enthusiasm there for research level mathematics. I think "is Lean the best system for mathematics" is an open problem; what we know is that Lean is the most popular system for mathematics, but that's a different claim.</p>

<p>The thought experiment in Kent Pitman's 1994 essay <a href="http://www.nhplace.com/kent/PS/Lambda.html">Lambda: The Ultimate Political Party</a> suggests that by being popular for mathematics, Lean will become the best for it. His point is that programming languages (and by extension ITPs) will, over time, adapt to the values of their user communities. As he puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Languages are a reflection of the community they serve. They become the way we express process, and so they inform our sense of what processes we expect.</p>

<p>The <code>Syntax</code> is already available, the "syntax-aware editing" I was referring to which is not available would be a function <code>Syntax → Syntax → TextEdit</code> which allows you to just modify the <code>Syntax</code> object and gives you the correct string-based edit description.

<p>Rather than something that does automatic diffing, I would rather take an AST of the file or part of it, point at a subterm syntax (using e.g. the syntax traverser stuff), and then replace it with a string generated by formatting another syntax that I would like to insert in that location. That would allow us to keep changes localized which is important for any code action. Getting the formatting to match the surroundings is less important, even rust-analyzer isn't that great at this (it relies on rustfmt to pick up the pieces).</p>

<p>The trouble starts when the changed syntax contains original syntax as well. One tough example I've been thinking about is fusing consecutive <code>if let</code>s into <code>if ... and</code>. There's a big block of existing syntax you don't want to touch there, <em>except</em> you want to re-indent it. Would be much easier if we can just reformat the whole result for sure.</p>
