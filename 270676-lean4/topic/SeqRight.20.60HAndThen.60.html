<p>I was a little surpised to leanr the following does not work:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">foobar</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">IO</span> <span class="n">Unit</span> <span class="o">:=</span>
  <span class="n">IO.println</span> <span class="s2">"foo"</span> <span class="bp">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">IO.println</span> <span class="s2">"bar"</span>
<span class="c">/-</span><span class="cm"></span>
<span class="cm">failed to synthesize instance</span>
<span class="cm">  HAndThen (IO Unit) (IO Unit) (IO Unit)</span>
<span class="cm">-/</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Lean 4 appears to missing the following instance:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">instance</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">SeqRight</span> <span class="n">m</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">HAndThen</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">m</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">m</span> <span class="n">β</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">m</span> <span class="n">β</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="o">⟨</span><span class="n">SeqRight.seqRight</span><span class="o">⟩</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I imagine there is some reason this instance has been dropped, but I am curious as to what it is. Especially, as the fact that <code>&gt;&gt;</code> does not work for monads would surprise anyone coming from something like Haskell.</p>
<p>I could see that such an instance  could cause overlap issues due to its generality. However, I would then think that there would instances for more specific cases (ex. an <code>HAndThen (IO α) (IO β) (IO β)</code> or  <code>AndThen (IO Unit)</code> instance).</p>

<p>We already have <code>*&gt;</code> for monads. We try to avoid duplicate operators that only exist for historical reasons in Haskell (see also: repurposing <code>return</code>)</p>

<p>But its not a duplicate operator? It is  a more general operator. Having a function that places the <code>HAndThen</code>/<code>AndThen</code> constraint on a object  means that the object doesn't have to be a first-order monad, it can be just a simple action (ex. <code>IO.RealWorld -&gt; IO.RealWorld </code> or <code>ParserState -&gt; ParserState</code>/<code>Parser</code>) rather than a monadic action (ex. <code>IO a</code>). That is, a monadic sequence is a more specialization case of <code>AndThen</code>. Thus, places that accept an <code>AndThen</code> would generally except monads <em>and</em> simple actions. This makes the fact that monadic actions are not considered a part of the broader action abstraction very unexpected (and concept-breaking). After all, even at a semantic level a monad sequence means 'perform monad action <code>m a</code> <em>and then</em> perform <code>m b</code>.</p>

<p>For monads specifically iirc it was decided to forbid heterogeneous sequencing because it allows implicitly forgetting return values. So instead of writing <code>getFoo &gt;&gt; print "got foo"</code> you must do <code>let _ &lt;- getFoo; print "got foo"</code>, i.e. explicitly ignore the return.</p>

<p>Still, there is no homogenous or <code>PUnit</code> instance either which does not have this problem. Furthermore, you can still do heterogenous sequence with <code>*&gt;</code>.  Also, I don't really get what's wrong stylistically with forgetting return values. I can imagine technically, though, that such automatic forgetting could be pain for type inference (both in implementation and in end-use).</p>
