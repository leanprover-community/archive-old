<p>This issue came up in <a href="#narrow/stream/287929-mathlib4/topic/unexpected.20variables">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/287929-mathlib4/topic/unexpected.20variables</a>. After applying <code>cases</code> to a hypothesis in the local context, another unused hypothesis which depends (in the dependent type sense) on that hypothesis is included in the type signature of the resulting declaration. This can be circumvented by <code>clear</code>ing the unwanted hypothesis before doing <code>cases</code>, but that seems undesirable.</p>

<p>That looks quite hard/unlikely to be fixed. <code>cases</code> can't know what variables you will use in the remaining proof, nor is adjusting the proof post-hoc a real option.</p>

<p>Interesting! But this wasn't happening in lean 3, right? I don't think I've ever seen a theorem in mathlib with a variable randomly being pulled in like that. Or am I wrong?</p>

<p>Lean 3 was "include always unless <code>omit</code>ted" afair. Lean 4 is "include if used in declaration", which turns out is tough to decide for <code>cases</code>.</p>

<p>Sebastian, that's not the Lean 3 behavior. The above code would work in Lean 3 with <code>a</code> not appearing in the type signatures of any of the decorations.</p>

<p>Kevin, these errors are actually going to be hard/ annoying to spot. The way it came up for me is I had a rewrite with one of these bad lemmas that generated random goals. But the bad variables were implicit, so I only found it by looking at the full type signature of each declaration in the list.</p>

<p>I think the difference with <code>omit</code> vs <code>clear</code> is that the former occurs outside of the declaration, whereas the latter is inside it. And it seems <em>very</em> strange to have to reference a variable in the proof which is explicitly <em>not</em> used in the proof.</p>

<p>I view something that was generated by something else meaningful I did in the proof (i.e., <code>_let_match</code>) very differently than something which is not related to anything in the declaration or proof script (I.e. <code>a</code>). However, I understand this may be just personal opinion. I wonder if <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span>  feels the same or differently though.</p>

<p>I'm still coming to terms with the new way variables are used in lean 4. I absolutely agree that use of variables decreases readability but it hadn't occurred to me that with autoImplicit it might actually be the case that we'll be using <code>variable</code> a whole lot less.</p>
