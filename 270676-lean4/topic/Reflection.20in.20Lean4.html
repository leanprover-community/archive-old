<p>I've noticed that reflection is better in Lean4 and not just the natural number improvements. For example the following expression in Lean3 takes much longer to reduce the more <code>x</code>s I add</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">#reduce</span>
  <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">ℕ</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">list.range</span> <span class="mi">10000</span><span class="o">)</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">nth_le</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="gr">sorry</span> <span class="k">in</span>
  <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>But the version in Lean4 takes more or less the same time no matter how many <code>x</code>s there are </p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">#reduce</span>
  <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">ℕ</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">List.range</span> <span class="mi">10000</span><span class="o">)</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">get</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="gr">sorry</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>Presumably Lean4 is evaluating <code>x</code> before reducing the <code>let</code>, but Lean3 reduces the <code>let</code> first and has to evaluate <code>x</code> seven times. Lean4 is also smart enough to not evaluate <code>x</code> at all in the following example</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">#reduce</span>
  <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">ℕ</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">List.range</span> <span class="mi">10000</span><span class="o">)</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">get</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="gr">sorry</span>
  <span class="mi">1</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I was thinking of writing the <code>abel</code> tactic in Lean4 using reflection a bit like the <code>ring2</code> tactic in mathlib in Lean 3. Is it sensible to use reflection a lot more in Lean 4? I can think of ways in which reducing things in the wrong order makes reduction take a lot longer. Has there been a deliberate effort to make reduction a lot faster in Lean 4 and is proof by reflection something we could do a lot more in Lean4 without having to worry some huge blow-up in the time it takes to reduce because the kernel is not unfolding things in the best order like the example in Lean3 above?</p>

<p>Not exactly answering your question, but FYI Lean4 has support for using the interpreter/compiler for (not as trustworthy) proofs by reflection: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/master/src/Init/Core.lean#L1012-L1031">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/master/src/Init/Core.lean#L1012-L1031</a> I was assuming that Mathlib would not want to use this feature though.</p>

<p>This is a decision that we will have to consider once mathlib4 is up and running. It's best to deal with this in the context of a particular proof that benefits greatly from it. But I would guess that this is treated the same as axiom usage reduction: it's okay to use and it's also okay to eliminate the use</p>
