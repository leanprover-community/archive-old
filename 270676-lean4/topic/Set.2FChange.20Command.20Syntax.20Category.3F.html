<p>Is possible / is it planned to be possible to set the syntax category used to parse commands? This would be a nice feature when writing files that are entirely written in a DSL. Is it also seems somewhat feasible given that way parsing works. The goal would be to do something like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">declare_syntax_cat</span> <span class="n">command2</span>
<span class="n">macro</span> <span class="s2">"#"</span> <span class="n">cmd</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">command</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">command2</span> <span class="bp">=&gt;</span> <span class="bp">`</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="bp">$</span><span class="n">cmd</span><span class="o">)</span>

<span class="c1">-- ... define various other DSL commands ..</span>

<span class="n">set_command_cat</span> <span class="n">command2</span>

<span class="c1">-- ... do stuff with DSL commands ...</span>

<span class="bp">#</span> <span class="kd">def</span>  <span class="n">foo</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="c1">-- ....</span>

<span class="c1">-- ... do more stuff with DSL commands ..</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>There was some talk about supporting something like Racket's <code>#lang</code> that would allow you to completely replace the default frontend, but nothing specific so far. This would allows for frontends that work completely different from the default one; we didn't think about special cases for ones that work like the default one, just with a different set of commands, yet.</p>

<p>That also sounds really cool! I was suggesting this most as it seemed the simplest step in that direction since it mostly just requires <code>topLevelCommandParserFn</code> ((in particular, the category it uses) to be passed on some parameter in the context, which seems quite feasible. However, being able to overwrite <code>runFrontend</code> (and, in particular, the header processing) as well would be even cooler.</p>
<p>I think Lean's metaprogramming framework provides a very good general base for exploring all kinds of interesting DSLs and other programming language idioms, so I will really love to be able to manipulate the entire syntax of a file (with something like <code>#lang</code>). Still though, custom commands would get pretty close to that already -- it really only misses the header.</p>
