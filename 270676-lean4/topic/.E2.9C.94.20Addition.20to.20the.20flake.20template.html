<p>thanks for the feedback <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span> ! Since I am guessing nix users are small in number, I won't open up the PR and we can just leave it up to user's own defaults. I also didn't realize there was a difference between <code>substituters</code> and <code>trusted-substituters</code>! I must have used the wrong one at some point and now just default to this in anger.</p>
