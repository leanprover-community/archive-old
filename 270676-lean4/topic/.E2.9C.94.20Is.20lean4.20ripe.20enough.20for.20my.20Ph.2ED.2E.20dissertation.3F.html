<p>Hello. I'd like to ask about your opinion. I want to do my Ph.D. on formalizing Chomsky hierarchy in Lean. I am going to start the research in 2021-11 and I want to complete my dissertation by 2025-03 ideally.</p>
<p>Given this agenda, do you think that lean4 is a good choice? So far, I have been studying lean3 only. I don't know how much better lean4 is going to be, how stable and useful it is already, and what are the prospects of mathlib4.</p>

<p>It sounds like you have plenty of time. So I would say, use lean 3, wait for things to stabilize to the point that porting is commonplace and large parts of mathlib are ported already, and then do your own porting. Or not, just stay in lean 3 and deliver the dissertation there. You won't get much accolades from porting your work or using beta software, so there isn't much sense in being an early adopter.</p>

<p>Put another way, the fact that your work is in lean 3 will not be a significant impediment to moving to lean 4, because (as a result of extensive work on porting tools) we are already handling much larger lean 3 developments (i.e. mathlib) and you can just tag along on the port.</p>
