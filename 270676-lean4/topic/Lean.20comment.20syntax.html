<p>Is there any rational behind the multiline comment syntax <code>/-</code> - <code>-/</code>? I found it cool, but is there any particular reason to use this? Is there a problem with <code>/*</code> - <code>*/</code> and <code>(*</code> - <code>*)</code> and <code>{-</code> - <code>-}</code>?</p>

<p>the answer to this kind of language design question is almost always "we lifted it from this other language"</p>

<p>that said I can't think of any other language that uses <code>/- -/</code>, including the languages from which lean draws the most inspiration (haskell, rust, adga, coq)</p>

<p>astoundingly, the character sequence <code>/-</code> cannot even be found on <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Comments">https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Comments</a></p>

<p>/me has war flashbacks from parsing <code>/*</code> for a subset-of-C compiler</p>

<p><code>/-</code> kind of looks like a compromise between Haskell's <code>{-</code> and the more common <code>/*</code>. But I don't really know.</p>

<p>I'm reminded of something I read in a document on the history of Haskell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comments provoked much discussion among the committee, and Wadler later formulated a law to describe how effort was allotted to various topics: semantics is discussed half as much as syntax, syntax is discussed half as much as lexical syntax, and lexical syntax is discussed half as much as the syntax of comments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this point of view, I like how unique <code>/- ... -/</code> is as a sort of statement of how the specific choice doesn't really matter <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>

<p>IIRC, the earliest versions of Lean had <code>--</code>, and Leo implemented <code>/- ... -/</code> for block comments during the summer of 2014 when Soonho Kong and I were at Microsoft. My vague (and possibly manufactured) memory is that it was a short conversation,  just trying to find something that was easy to type and would not cause conflicts.</p>

<p>Given that Lean was written in C++, Leo and Soonho would have had <code>/* ... */</code> and <code>//</code> in mind, and given that Leo was already using <code>--</code>, <code>/- ... -/</code> would have been a natural choice.</p>
