<p>When using the Lean 4 VSCode plugin, I often have trouble separating different goals since there's just a huge page of text in the infoview. Would it be possible to, e.g., apply some kind of coloring or highlighting to be able to quickly pick out goals? There's the little colored turnstile, but it doesn't really stick out that much.</p>
