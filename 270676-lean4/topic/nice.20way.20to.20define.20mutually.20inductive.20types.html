<p>The adhoc definition of <code>KrivineXXX.term</code> looks a bit strange, but I'm not sure if it's related to missing features or if I'm not aware of a better way to do this kind of these definitions.</p>
<p>I would just like to have <code>KrivineClosure := KrivineInstruction Ã— KrivineEnv</code> and <code>KrivineEnv := List KrivineClosure</code> if that's possible.</p>

<p>My question are now:</p>
<p>(a) is there an issue related to the lack of codegen for recursors?<br>
(b) is there a better way to do this or a more "proper" way?<br>
(c) where can I read more about recursors and such things?</p>

<p>I haven't looked closely at how v4 handles the recursors for nested inductives, but if you can use the new generated one to define a Prop-valued less than relation on KrivineEnv you should be able to define recursive functions using Acc.rec. That's how the non-structural recursion in core is defined.<br>
Mario's paper obviously has information on the formation of recursors for regular inductive types. For nested inductives the only source is probably the kernel code.</p>

<p>Actually my paper borrows heavily from Dybjer, <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~peterd/papers/Inductive_Families.pdf">Inductive Families</a>, which was also the official source for the lean implementation. That paper covers nested and mutual inductives as well, although mine doesn't. (However my paper covers universes and large elimination, unlike Dybjer, who was working in a generic dependent type theory without universes.)</p>

<p>Actually I lied, it covers mutual inductives but not nested inductives. (There are also entire "Omitted." sections in the definition of mutual inductives.) From looking at the kernel terms produced by a nested inductive, it's clearly just doing the same as the analogous mutual inductive where you mutually define all the inductives and nested versions; the only technically interesting thing that happens is that if you have <code>| mk : list T -&gt; T</code> then you don't just get <code>list_T</code> and <code>T</code> defined mutually, you actually get a recursor that talks about <code>list T</code> and <code>list_T</code> is not created. So we are adding new axioms on an existing inductive type which is just slightly questionable. (It can still be modeled by using less nominal types.)</p>
