<p>Hi everyone. I am a PhD student at the University of Technology Sydney. My major is programming language theory, and I found LEAN may be helpful in my work. After going through the introductions, I still have some questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the status of the mathlib for LEAN4? Are we rewriting it in LEAN4, or are the former libraries simply suited for LEAN4?</li>
<li>Things like partially ordered sets or domain theory are essential for program analysis. If there is no existing work on this in LEAN, maybe I can help.</li>
</ol>

<p>to answer 1, I would look around the <a class="stream" data-stream-id="287929" href="/#narrow/stream/287929-mathlib4">#mathlib4</a> channel where mathport is discussed. I believe the plan is to port mathlib to lean4, but that effort is not nearly done. Feel free to read the last <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/blog/posts/intro-to-mathport/">mathport status report</a> for more context</p>
