<p>I've very new, but I have one very specific question and one general question. (1) Say I had some proposition that came up about graphs (it's currently phrased in the language of Serre and his book on Trees) about paths/geodesics and how they "overlap", would lean be a reasonable place to try to prove it formally? (2) Is there a good source that maps the different proof languages to underlying type systems and compares them - in a way that a math person could read and then decide which is best?</p>

<p>re:Question 2, I'm a non-expert but I would be interested to know if say, system A did dependent types (or your-favorite-thing) and system B didn't. I'd be interested to just have an accurate mapping of which concepts go where even if I didn't understand them - but also interested in which things have practical considerations and which are totally theoretical.</p>

<p>nCatLab is occasionally abstruse but it's still very useful just because it names concepts and organizes them. Is there a similar thing in this area? <br>

<p>That said, if you just want to know what axiomatic system the various provers are using: Coq, Lean - CIC (dependent type theory); HOL, HOL4, HOL Light, Isabelle/HOL - HOL (simple type theory); Mizar, Metamath, Isabelle/ZF - ZFC (set theory); Agda, RedPRL, Cubicaltt, UniMath, NuPRL - specialized logics or HoTT variants</p>

<p>I suppose there is also Idris? <br>
This list helps!<br>
 I'm sort of hoping for me a 1-dimensional simplicial complex with boundary maps etc. will suffice for the graph (maybe this is even already done in lean) and I'll probably have to do my own work to define what I mean by path and some other data</p>
<p>I'd be interested if there were formal reasons to prefer dependent vs simple types but practically speaking it sounds like dependent+Lean is the way to go.</p>

<p>With high probability they will use a different definition of "graph". IIRC the Lean Together 2020 talk was about finite graphs, and in Serre's book there are infinite trees all over the place.</p>

<p>You will be able to do it in Lean and Coq and Mizar, you may or may not be able to do it in Isabelle/HOL depending on whether you need dependent types or not (e.g. topological spaces don't need dependent types, sheaves on topological spaces do), and who knows whether you'll be able to do it in HoTT because the moment you ask someone about it they'll start talking about infinity-topoi :-(</p>

<p>It is nice to be able to have them as a specialization of a cell-complex so you can cone off or add things but it depends on what you're doing. (I don't currently need it but having general cell-complex stuff implemented would be really neat)</p>
<p>For Serre a graph is a set of edges and vertices where you think of the edges as being directed. Formally there's a map called *  from E to E such that (e<em>)</em>=e and e* != e and a initial and terminal boundary map from E to V that satisfies b_initial(e)=b_terminal(e*)</p>

<p>Yes, precisely. I tried with <code>V \times list V</code>, lean had trouble with recursion, so then I tried to define everything in terms of something like fold but in the end a type with explicit constructors was easier to work with</p>

<p>It makes sense in many contexts to have <code>adj : V -&gt; V -&gt; W</code> for some labelling type <code>W</code> that would be <code>Prop</code> (or <code>bool</code> ? I seem to remember that in Coq it makes a huge difference for some reason, probably due to decidability/proof irrelevance/something) for usual graphs, but <code>W = \nat</code> gives multiplicity, probabilists like <code>W = nnreal</code>, computer scientists like to put a monoid there.</p>

<p>For Serre a graph is a set of edges and vertices where you think of the edges as being directed. Formally there's a map called *  from E to E such that (e<em>)</em>=e and e* != e and a initial and terminal boundary map from E to V that satisfies b_initial(e)=b_terminal(e*)</p>

<p>BTW, is there a canonical way to say "I wrote something that does not quite fit in a chat like here, is definitely PR material, and I would like to get some feedback"?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="242586">@Vincent Beffara</span> , here is some feedback :) </p>
<p>Let me just look at the first line of your file, i.e.,</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">structure</span> <span class="n">Graph</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">V</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">adj</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">V</span> <span class="bp">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">V</span> <span class="bp">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Prop</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">sym</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">symmetric</span> <span class="n">adj</span><span class="o">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>because there is a lot to say on this, and it determines everything that follows. What you are doing here is called a fully bundled approach, i.e., a <code>Graph</code> object contains a carrier type, and additional data on this type. This is the way things are typically done in coq. The usual approach in Lean is just a little bit more unbundled: we would start from a type, say <code>V</code>, and then we would tell Lean that this type has a graph structure by registering a graph typeclass. An advantage of this approach is that you work with a single underlying type, and you can put several structures on it (a graph structure, a group structure, and so on), and you can discuss how they relate "from the inside". It would read something like</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">class</span> <span class="n">Graph</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">V</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span><span class="bp">*</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:=</span>
<span class="o">(</span><span class="n">adj</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">V</span> <span class="bp">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">V</span> <span class="bp">-&gt;</span> <span class="kt">Prop</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">(</span><span class="n">sym</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">symmetric</span> <span class="n">adj</span><span class="o">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Let me show what the next lines could look like, to show how one uses such typeclasses:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">namespace</span> <span class="n">Graph</span>

<span class="kn">variables</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">V</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span><span class="bp">*</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">V&#39;</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span><span class="bp">*</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">Graph</span> <span class="n">V</span><span class="o">]</span>  <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">Graph</span> <span class="n">V&#39;</span><span class="o">]</span>

</pre></div>


<p>First, I enter a namespace, to make sure that I keep my names separated from other areas where one could use the words <code>edge</code>, for instance, and also to make <code>adj</code> available. Then, I declare some variables and some typeclasses that will be available from this point on, to avoid restating them all the time. The interesting point is when I define <code>linked</code>: there is no explicit reference to the graph structure, but since I am mentioning points on <code>V</code> Lean will try to find the graph structure on <code>V</code> (which is given by the typeclass declared two lines above) and understand by itself that <code>adj</code> refers to this graph structure.</p>
<p>Then in your file you have two definitions of connected, that I have merged in one single definition because I don't see why we would need two. And I have declared it as a type class extending <code>Graph</code>, which means that you will only need to  declare <code>[connected_graph V]</code> if you want to assume that there is a connected graph structure on <code>V</code>, without writing <code>[Graph V]</code> first.</p>
<p>If you have some questions about what I have just written, or if you would be interested in the same kind of "standardification" on some other parts of your files, don't hesitate to ask!</p>

<p>For instance, if <code>G</code> is a group and <code>S</code> is a generating set, then its Cayley graph <code>Cay S</code> (which, as a type, is just a copy of <code>G</code>, but it really should be distinguished from <code>G</code>) has a canonical graph structure. I think it is important to do it this way because then you want to deduce a distance on <code>Cay S</code> and do some analysis/geometry, for which you need the metric space typeclass. You can not get the metric space typeclass if you don't have first a graph typeclass to start with.</p>

<p>Sure, but I don't see the advantage compared to a graph typeclass. If you want to do some finite graph theory, or some automaton theory, you will start with a type with a graph structure, and you will work with this structure, just like you would do with a group structure or with a metric space structure, so typeclasses look like a good choice. Of course, if you start putting several graph structures on the same type, you would need to play the <code>@</code> dance, just like for metric spaces say.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The graph structure being implicit is useful when you have one single graph on some type, and you want to talk about it without ever modifying it. If you want to modify a graph, or have several graph structures, then you should go for the structure approach (but still with <code>Graph V</code> instead of having <code>V</code> as a data inside the graph structure, as this is the way everything is done in Lean, so once you want to interface with other parts of the library it will be much easier this way).</p>
<p>One subtely though: metric space structures are implicit type classes in all mathlib, because most of the time you use just one such structure on the space, and you don't want to specify it all the time. This means that if you want to put a metric space structure on a type using the graph distance, then different graphs will give you different distances, and things will become messy. A trick in situations like that (which is in fact more than a trick) is to have copies of the same type, but with different names. For instance, if you have a group <code>G</code> and a generating set <code>S</code>, then you could define <code>Cay S</code> to be a copy of <code>G</code>, and endow it with the graph distance coming from the Cayley graph structure for the generating <code>S</code>. In this way, you get different metric spaces structures on the different <code>Cay S</code>, which to Lean kernel are the same, but to typeclass resolution are different. If the graph structure was a typeclass, then this would also work well here, as you would put different graph structures on different <code>Cay S</code>.</p>

<p>This seems to have something to do with the fact that a graph structure given a type is not canonical, while a metric structure given a graph is canonical (are there cases where a graph is endowed with a metric that is not the graph distance ?) At least lurking in this chatroom, and reading some of your comments, makes me afraid to use typeclasses here.</p>

<p>I never used parameters. <code>variable</code> is just a shorthand: it means that instead of writing <code>my_beautiful_theorem {V : Type*} {G : Graph V} ...</code> you can just write <code>my_beautiful_theorem ...</code>. The theorems with one syntax or the other are <em>exactly</em> the same.</p>
<p>The summary is: if you will just use one graph structure on your type, go for typeclasses. Otherwise, use a structure, and pass it as one of the arguments of all your theorems, eiter as <code>{G : Graph V}</code> if it can be inferred by some other data in the statement of the theorem, or as <code>(G : Graph V)</code> otherwise. This can be done explicitly in all your statements if needed, or using a <code>variable</code> at the beginning of the section to avoid repetitions.</p>

<p>In the first sorry, you would explain to Lean how a graph structure gives a metric space structure. In the second sorry, you would construct the Cayley graph structure on <code>Cay S</code>, which is just <code>G</code> in disguise. And then Lean knows that <code>Cay S</code> is a graph, and therefore a metric space thanks to the first instance. The last line is only there to check that Lean does indeed know this, but it can be safely removed.</p>

<p>Do we have any reason to believe that fully bundled structures a la category theory will be easier to work with in Lean 4? One nice thing about partially bundled structures is that morphisms are actually functions -- although when you start dealing with e.g. algebra maps then they become types again.</p>

<p>At least coercions to functions should work better in Lean 4, so applying a morphism as a function should work more reliably. But it mostly works fine already in Lean 3, if the morphism is a variable for instance.</p>

<p>One of the downsides of using <code>structure Graph</code> instead of <code>structure Graph V</code> is that with <code>structure Graph</code> it's much harder to consider two graphs on the same type because you can't rely on <code>G.V = G'.V</code> being a <code>rfl</code> anymore.</p>

<p>So I tried the type class route, but I'm confused about something:</p>

</pre></div>


<p>Why is the <code>V</code> parameter implicit (or meta-variable-ish) in <code>adj</code> and not in <code>sym</code>? Is there a way to set things up so that one can use the symmetry assumption as <code>Graph.sym</code> rather than <code>Graph.sym G</code>? In all cases I met, <code>Graph.sym _</code> works just fine ...</p>

<p>Second question, still following the type class option, how do you say "there is a graph structure on type <code>G</code> that satisfies this and that property"? Is it just <code>∃ C : Graph G</code> and then use all the definitions and theorems with <code>@</code> all over to specify the instance every time?</p>

<p>I agree with Yury that this is probably the best approach. For instance, if you want to do percolation at some point, you will have a bunch of different random graphs on <code>Z^d</code>, so registering them as a type class would be a really bad idea. But having a copy of the space associated to the graph makes it possible to use a metric space structure as he explains.</p>
