<p>Are there any tactics in Lean, or algorithms in general, that take a proof term and find a more optimal version of it? That is, for example, something shorter or more general? To what extent is this theoretically possible?</p>

<p>It's been mentioned that metamath has something like this (<a href="#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/tactic.20preference/near/213691346">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/tactic.20preference/near/213691346</a>), and I think the idea of finding shorter proofs was also part of the GPT-f paper.</p>

<p>Oh he mentioned gpt-f in the very next message, oops.</p>

<p>A few of the linters do things like this, removing unneeded parts of proofs. I wrote a few that I can post links to later that aren't in mathlib, but I have used on mathlib. They do things like find unnecessary uses of by_cases, cases, hypotheses that can be removed.</p>

<p>That would be great, thank you.</p>
