<p>I had the joy to listen to the Weierstra√ü Lecture about analytic geometry by Peter Scholze and I was very pleasantly surprised to hear about Lean being used to formalize a theorem used, since I played around with Coq when I was still in school and am still interested in Type-Theoretic Proof assistants</p>
<p>Lean seems like a much better documented community/software than coq</p>
<p>I'd love to contribute somewhere in the future</p>

<p>Hi! It's perhaps better documented for mathematicians; I think there is plenty of Coq documentation which is more computer-science focussed. One of the things we're trying to do here is to have a maths library which is capable of understanding at least at lot of the <em>statements</em> of the theorems of modern mathematics, and for this to work it's important that mathematicians can get on board!</p>
