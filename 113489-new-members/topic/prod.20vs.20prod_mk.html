<p>I see that in most parts of Mathlib (especially for more basic stuff, such as topology) lemmas having to do with the function <code>(λ x, (f x, g x))</code> are named with <code>prod_mk</code>, whereas in some newer part of mathlib they are named with simply <code>prod</code> (for example there is<code>times_cont_diff.prod</code> instead of <code>times_cont_diff.prod_mk</code>). I guess the reason for the first name was to distinguish it from <code>prod_map</code>(<code>(λ x y, (f x, g y))</code>) to avoid ambiguity. Since I am writing a lot of lemmas on product manifolds, I was wondering if it may be a good idea to look for uniformity in Mathlib on these names or if I can choose freely which convention to adopt.</p>

<p>Coherence is definitely a good option. As to whether we should use <code>prod_mk</code> or <code>prod</code>, I don't have a strong opinion, but I think I prefer slightly <code>prod</code> as it is shorter, and not really ambiguous.</p>
