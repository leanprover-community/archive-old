<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a few goals that can be solved by an identical sequence of tactics:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code>  <span class="n">any_goals</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">unfold</span> <span class="n">Rule.eval_head</span><span class="o">},</span>
  <span class="n">any_goals</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">refine</span> <span class="n">le_sup_iff.mpr</span> <span class="n">_</span><span class="o">},</span>
  <span class="n">any_goals</span><span class="o">{</span><span class="n">left</span><span class="o">},</span>
  <span class="n">any_goals</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">simp</span><span class="o">},</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>(I'm not sure how to collapse that into a single usage of <code>any_goals</code> either )<br>
However, some of these tactics also apply to later goals and destroy the proof I already developed for those goals.<br>
So I'm wondering if there is a way to apply tactics only to select goals and not other ones.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Have you tried <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#work_on_goal">tactic#work_on_goal</a>?</p>

<p>Hm the link doesn't work but <code>work_on_goal i {⋯}</code> applies the tactics <code>⋯</code> to the goal <code>i</code> (indexed from zero). You're not required to close the goals and Lean will remember any progress you make</p>

<p>I have not, is there a way to use work_on_goal so that it works on multiple goals at once? From the documentation it seems that it only works on one at a time</p>

<p>I suppose I could solve the goal that is being ruined by any_goals first and then try</p>

<p>I think that <code>any_goals { tac1, tac2,... }</code> should apply to all goals where the sequence <code>tac1, tac2,...</code> works.  In particular, if one of the tactics does not work on the goals that you do not want to change, then you are in luck!</p>

<p>Notice that <code>any_goals { tac1 }, any_goals { tac2 }</code> is very different from <code>any_goals { tac1, tac2 }</code>: the former is much more likely of using tactic <code>tac2</code> than the latter.</p>

<p>Thanks :) I feel like I understand Lean a bit better now. I was able to solve it a few different ways with your suggestions</p>

<p>For finer control and less wasted CPU cycles on with <code>try</code> or <code>any_goals</code>: if you want to apply the same thing to goals # 4, # 5, # 7, you can do</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">swap</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">swap</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">swap</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="o">,</span>
<span class="n">iterate</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="c">/-</span><span class="cm"> same thing that applies to all three -/</span> <span class="o">},</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>because <code>swap n</code> doesn't actually exchange the first goal with the <code>n</code>th, but actually do a cyclic permutation of the first <code>n</code> goals.</p>
