<p>I think it deserves a thread of its own, but I'm going to say something related:<br>
In Lean 3 I remember being able to ctrl+click on imports and it would take me to the respective modules. But I'm not able to do it in Lean 4 anymore <span aria-label="sad" class="emoji emoji-2639" role="img" title="sad">:sad:</span><br>
(can a mod split this thread in two please? <span aria-label="pray" class="emoji emoji-1f64f" role="img" title="pray">:pray:</span> )</p>

<p>In Lean4, are the cases it doesn't work for you stdlib modules perchance?</p>

<p>It doesn't work for any import right now (modules inside the package nor from core (<code>Prelude.lean</code> for instance))</p>

<p>Is there any pattern to when this is happening?  In particular, is this happening when you have an error in your code?  Or when the orange progress bar hasn't made (enough) progress yet?</p>
