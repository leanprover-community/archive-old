<p>Hello everyone! I'm trying out the Zulip chat for the first time, and trying to build my first lean project. I wanted to do something involving toposes, and so have tried Mehta's topos build found here: <a href="https://github.com/b-mehta/topos">https://github.com/b-mehta/topos</a></p>
<p>I'm getting a lot of "failed to synthesize type class" errors, though. Is this code obsolete (e.g. written for Lean 2?) or are toposes best sought elsewhere? Thanks, in advance!</p>
<p>I see here that evidently sites are already in mathlib...</p>

<p>It's definitely not lean 2 code, but lean 3 moves pretty fast so bitrot would not surprise me</p>

<p>I haven't kept up to date with maintaining this, sorry! It could still build on an earlier version of Lean, it last worked on 3.23.0. Sites are already in mathlib, and I'm pretty sure that's one of the things causing the build errors.</p>

<p>To clarify: the two options are elementary toposes (finite limits, cartesian closed, subobject classifier) or Grothendieck/sheaf toposes (sheaves on a site), with the latter being a special case of the former. Bhavik's <code>topos.lean</code> takes the first definition.</p>

<p>Sorry everyone! Still slow on the uptake with the chat. I'm interested in Grothendieck toposes (so I may not need the 'topos' file that hasn't been updated.) Thank you all for the warm welcome.</p>
<p>I'm very new to Lean (I've completed natural number game and most of the real analysis "game" and have watched quite a few videos over the past month) and am going to try to formalize a certain topos to continue getting experience with the system. I hope to attend LFTCM at ICERM in July...but hopefully by then will know a bit more. Right now, my code is awful...</p>

<p>Thanks! I'm happy to know that I'm not being too reckless by trying to dive in like this! I will try  your suggested exercise. Presently I'm doing something that is perhaps even more lowbrow: I'm trying to construct a category consisting of a single object and whose morphisms are given by the multiplicative semigroup of natural numbers. I'm hoping to gain some proficiency with Lean by stepping this up gradually in order to formalize the Connes-Consani Arithmetic Site. I am wondering if geometric morphisms appear anywhere here, yet? I'm particularly looking forward to trying to formalize the points of the associated topos.</p>

<p>Thank you again for the exercise...</p>

<p>Very exciting! So this might be even closer than I had hoped to realizing the identification of the points with the Adèle class space. Great!</p>

<p>The main technical gap (apart from complex analysis) is showing that the compact open topology on a compact space is the same as the sup-norm topology, I think <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10967">#10967</a> nearly does this.</p>

<p>We can already define zeta as a bare function on Re(s)&gt;1, and presumably we can do this for Gamma too? Then the questions are proving continuity and holomorphicity.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="462733">@Jon Bannon</span> formalizing the definition of Connes-Consani's arithmetic site should be a very doable project. Mathlib has the category of sheaves on a site (taking values in any category), so you can get the associated topos. We don't yet have the characterization of Grothendieck topoi, or anything about geometric morphisms, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Yes this is really not so bad, my above category problem was easily solved using  'single_obj'. I don't think I'm going to be able to go back to non-Lean mathematics after knowing what this thing can do...how much fun is this?</p>

<p>There's a huge amount to do before we can even state the theorems of most of my papers but part of the project right now is to get things like modular forms and automorphic representations defined</p>

<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="243562">Adam Topaz</span> <a href="#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/topos/near/265843861">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="462733">Jon Bannon</span> formalizing the definition of Connes-Consani's arithmetic site should be a very doable project. Mathlib has the category of sheaves on a site (taking values in any category), so you can get the associated topos. We don't yet have the characterization of Grothendieck topoi, or anything about geometric morphisms, unfortunately.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So @Adam Topaz, it seems that we can easily get the associated topos as you say by something like:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">J</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">grothendieck_topology.trivial</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">single_obj</span> <span class="n">ℕ</span><span class="o">)</span>

<span class="kd">def</span>  <span class="n">hatNx</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">Sheaf</span> <span class="n">J</span> <span class="kt">Type</span><span class="bp">*</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>(I'm new to this type theory approach...so my last line might be very wrong...Connes-Consani want to consider sheaves of sets, but I imagine here that this translates into general types? I'm inferring this from the definition of concrete category in Lean.) So this can definitely at least get started. It looks like we need to develop the ability to talk about structures internal to a topos, is this right? (We have something like the tropical semiring here, but I don't know how to make it internal to the topos.)</p>

<p>We don't have much about stuff internal to a topos at the moment. But Adam has developed a bunch about abelian sheaves recently.</p>

<p>It's been a while since I read Connes-Consani, so I'm not up to speed about what would be needed for that.</p>

<p>This might be important, actually. I don't think we want a zero. Do you happen to know where I might find \N^x?</p>

<p>To define the structure sheaf, for now you could define it as a sheaf of rings -- we still don't have anything about internal ring objects in a topos</p>

<p>Great! 'pnat' worked.</p>
<p>I'll try to define the structure sheaf as a sheaf of rings. Thanks!</p>
