<p>I've been having some sketchy behavior with the VS code extension. Sometimes when I open my project, the Lean server will fail to start, and I am occasionally told to install Lean (which is already installed). If I close and restart the folder a few times, it usually eventually starts working properly. </p>
<p>Has anyone seen behavior like this before, or know how to fix it? Thanks</p>

<p>I had this on windows.</p>
