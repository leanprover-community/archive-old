<p>starting a thread to introduce myself! my name is carter, and i'm an undergrad at brown university. i got interested in Lean after taking a class with <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="110596">Rob Lewis</span> in the fall. i think i’m mainly interested in doing elementary mathematics in Lean for fun. the coolest thing i’ve done is my final project for the aforementioned class, where i <a href="https://github.com/ccobb1/fpv-final-project">solved</a> problem A3 of the <a href="https://kskedlaya.org/putnam-archive/2018.pdf">2018 Putnam competition</a> in Lean. lately, i've been having fun trying my hand at some <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c3415_amc_12ahsme">AMC</a> problems.</p>
<p>it’s great that there’s such an active Lean community—i’ve found answers to a lot of questions i had just by searching on this site, and i’m sure it’ll continue to be a great resource. thank you to all who contribute here, as well as those working on mathlib and Lean’s development!</p>

<p>Hey that's an excellent project! I hope that by the end of my course my students will be doing projects as ambitious as that. If you're interested in contributing to mathlib proper then take a look at the wiki page on low-hanging fruit <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/wiki/Undergrad-low-hanging-fruits">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/wiki/Undergrad-low-hanging-fruits</a></p>
