<p>The <code>apply</code> tactic takes the goal and tries to solve it by applying the subsequent term to as of yet unobtained subgoals. Is there a dual tactic of this, where it introduces the term you stated as a new assumption? This would basically be like <code>have</code> except you don't have to figure out the type of the term. i.e. you can start with a term without knowing the proposition it proves, as opposed to starting with a proposition and then finding its proof.</p>
