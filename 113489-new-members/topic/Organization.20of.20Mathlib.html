<p>While working through the bounded_lattice file, I noticed that there are a lot of different classes in the file.  Is it standard practice to put a whole bunch of classes related together into one file, or have the various classes in that file not yet been split out into their own files?  Maybe a better example would be splitting lattice into a file for distributive_lattice, join_semilattice, and meet_semilattice? I'm not giving any suggestions or criticism.  I'm simply trying to understand the organizational choices being made.</p>

<p>It can be done either way. If there are lots of files importing can become more annoying/pedantic, this way you just say "I want lattices" and you get all the stuff</p>

<p>Note that not all the classes are actually in there, in particular I think complete lattices and boolean lattices are in another file</p>

<p>Couldn't that be solved in a manner similar to <a href="https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib/blob/master/ql/processes/all.hpp">https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib/blob/master/ql/processes/all.hpp</a>, which is pulling a lot of the stochastic process machinery into one header file for inclusion?</p>

<p>Yeah, we do that too, with <code>default.lean</code> files scattered about</p>

<p>not so much inside mathlib itself because we want to keep the dependency graph as decoupled as is reasonable</p>

<p>but all these lattice theorems have low/similar dependencies so they don't hurt the dependency graph situation too much</p>

<p>That said, mathlib has seen many authors with different views on this subject, so some of the judgment calls here are made differently in different parts of the library</p>

<p>But there seems to be a naming convention for definitions and theorems, right? Just not for files, then? (And where can I find anything regarding such conventions?)</p>
