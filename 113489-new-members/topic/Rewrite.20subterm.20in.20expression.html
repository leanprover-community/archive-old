<p>Hi, I've proved the associativity of addition in the natural number game, but for the base case I had to resort to letting refl skip some steps for me because I couldn't figure out how to rewrite a subterm in an expression.</p>
<p>Here's my proof with a comment that should hopefully explain the dilemma.</p>

<p>What refl automated for me is admittedly incredibly trivial, but I would like to know how I could get the goal to "a + (b + c) = a + (b + c)" manually.</p>

<p>Well, you could think about it that way too but what I meant was: I think your goal is</p>

<p>Rather than trying to rewrite the left-hand side until it turns into the right-hand side, you can rewrite both sides until they turn into the same other thing (namely <code>a + b</code>).</p>

<p>Ah right. I wasn't sure if you meant that or not because I don't (yet) know how to use rw to rewrite the RHS.  That of course makes sense.</p>

<p>Oh right, because <code>rw</code> wants to replace all occurrences of the thing it's rewriting. It's possible to avoid that using another tactic but I don't think it exists in the NNG.</p>
