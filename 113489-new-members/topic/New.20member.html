<p>Hi Everyone, </p>
<p>I'm slowly getting familiar with Zulip/Lean. I want to learn more math so it could help me abstract complex programming problems so it'll be easier to reason about them and synthesis solutions and understanding. Is this the right place? </p>
<p>The last math education was Calc 3 in Community College which I failed. I really want to understand Category theory. I feel the web and it's interactions are so complex that I feel a constant need to find a new language to simplify all the complex ideas that programmers have to deal with.</p>
<p>Any ideas on where a person like me can start?</p>
<p>I'm curious about dependent type theory and Category theory.</p>

<p>For category theory, if you are first and foremost a programmer, there is always the classical by now book by Bartosz Milewski: <a href="https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/">https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/</a></p>

<p>I've been hearing a buzz about applied category theory recently.  I haven't read it, but I've paged through <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/teaching/sp18/7Sketches.pdf">7 sketches in compositionality: an invitation to applied category theory</a>. If you don't have some abstract algebra background, I imagine it would be tough going without guidance, but at the least it looks like it might give you some idea of what the subject is about.</p>

<p>Hi everyone, </p>
<p>Following Jeremy Avigad's advice from today's Topos Institute Colloquium talk I'd like to introduce myself and ask a couple of basic questions regarding how to better learn Lean. I'm a graduate student at Notre Dame currently interested in factorization homology and category theory. I have a fairly strong background in topology and category theory so I think I might be well-equipped to formalize those two areas, if that hasn't been done already.</p>
<p>So my first question is: what is the best resource to learn the fundamentals of Lean, dependent type theory, and formalization?<br>
My second question (from which I will benefit only in the future) is: once I'm sufficiently fluent in Lean, where can I find a list of things that need to be formalized?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>A solid approach, too, is to formalize something that interests you, whether or not it's already in mathlib, and along the way you'll start finding missing lemmas that might be generally useful, and after some polishing they can be your first contributions. Mathlib is pretty big, so that can help with getting a feel for what's in it, too.</p>

<p>Yay factorization homology! Welcome.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we don't have a particularly good "todo list" for formalisation, and it can take some experimentation / asking around to identifying the boundary of what is currently possible. Throwing out ideas here on zulip generally gets fast feedback.</p>
