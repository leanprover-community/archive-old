<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QED_manifesto?wprov=sfla1">wikipedia entry on the QED manifesto</a> states:</p>
<p>"[T]he Mizar library has successfully formalized a large portion of undergraduate mathematics. As of 2007 it is the largest such library."</p>
<p>Obviously, this is outdated. What should the page say today?  And is there a meaningful quantitative way to compare the Mizar library with mathlib?</p>

<p>We maintain <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad.html">a list of undergraduate mathematics formalized in Lean</a>, based on the French curriculum. So my first suggestion would be to compare the percentage of completion of that list to that of Mizar.</p>

<p>Another quick and dirty comparison would be <a href="https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/">the progress on the top 100 theorems</a>. Apparently Lean is now ahead of Mizar by 1 whole theorem!</p>

<p>I think it's very difficult to make such comparisons, especially in this somewhat rapidly changing area, most obvious metrics have flaws. The aim of a reference work like Wikipedia should probably instead stick to mentioning some big projects in the area, when the absolute "largest" is hard to pin down with a reasonable measure of size.</p>

<p>Thanks for the links!  I just thought it would be appropriate to mention mathlib on that page.  And if it was possible to make a vague quantitative comparison, I would also include it there.  But I can't find as a good an overview over what parts of the curriculum are actually covered by the Mizar library.  So for now I've just made the most minimal edit to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QED_manifesto">Wikipedia page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Mizar Mathematical Library formalizes a large portion of undergraduate mathematics, and was considered the largest such library in 2007.[4] Similar projects include the Metamath proof database and the mathlib library written in Lean.[5]</p>
