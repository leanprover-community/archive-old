<p>Dear all:</p>
<p>Suppose I have an affine space, S. On that space I have a set , F, of all possible coordinate systems (each induced by a different affine frame). Between each ordered pair, (f1, f2), of coordinate systems in F we have a change-of-coordinates isomorphism, i_f1_f2. Let I_S denote  the set of all such isomorphisms between all  affine coordinate systems on F. What's the right abstract algebraic name for the algebraic structure, I_S?</p>

<p>Yes, that's the type in mathlib of a pair of transforms between any two coordinate systems. I'm looking for the abstract algebraic name of the set of <em>all</em> such isomorphisms on the set of all possible affine coordinate systems.</p>

<p>Thank you. That's close but not quite it. That concept involves mappings of a space to itself. What we've got in my case are (1) a base affine space, S; (2) a set of affine coordinate spaces, F (where each associates a <em>coordinate tuple</em> with each point and vector in S and where these coordinate tuples are the points and vectors of the new affine coordinate space); and where we're now looking at the set of all isomorphisms between these affine coordinate spaces.</p>

<p>Reid, yes, this seems to be right. Thank you.</p>
