<p>I would file this as an issue, but I'm not sure where to post it.</p>
<p>In VIM mode, we use C-w (Ctrl+w) to move around the panes / splits. VSCode's VIM extension is aware of it and intercepts C-w. However, for some reason, when I navigate past Infoview window, I press C-w and it gets closed, causing mild frustration.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what's the strategy for fixing this, but I think that us VIM extension users should put our heads together and fix it. Using mouse to navigate is slo-o-o-ow.</p>

<p>Possibly related to <a href="https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/issues/7257">https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/issues/7257</a> (seems like maybe if you can reproduce it'd belong there at least)</p>
