<p>Is there any formalization of classical algebraic geometry in Lean? I'm mostly interested in projective geometry, at the level of what's covered in chapter I of Hartshorne, especially theorem I.7.7, about the intersection of a projective variety and a hypersurface not containing it.</p>
<p>If there is nothing like this, how much effort  would it take to implement it, given what is already available? I'm reasonably familiar with typed functional languages (ML, Haskell), but dependently typed ones not so much. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>It will be a difficult task, but it is true that I will attempt to do it. Quite how far I will get I have no clue.</p>

<p>Noetherian rings we have, basic stuff, I don't think anyone has done the Nullstellensatz yet, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="231800">@Lennard Henze</span> is working on Noether normalisation, we have Hilbert basis theorem</p>

<p>I guess the positive side of the situation you describe is that, at least, I don't have to learn new mathematics to start contributing. I'm installing Lean right now. :-)</p>

<p>FYI here's the course outline from last year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Course outline.<br>
(1) Affine varieties – definition, examples, maps between varieties, translating<br>
between geometry and commutative algebra (the Nullstellensatz)<br>
(2) Projective varieties – definition, examples, maps between varieties, rigidity<br>
and images of maps<br>
(3) Dimension – several different definitions (all equivalent, but useful for<br>
different purposes), calculating dimensions of examples<br>
(4) Smoothness and singularities – definition, examples, key theorems<br>
(5) Examples of varieties (depending on how much time is left)<br>
What is not in the course?<br>
(1) Schemes<br>
(2) Sheaves and cohomology<br>
(3) Curves, divisors and the Riemann–Roch theorem</p>
</blockquote>

<p>when I'm done with Noether normalisation I want to turn to Nullstellensatz</p>
