<p>Hi, I've been writing an implementation of amenable (discrete) groups (via the existence of left-invariant menas). It now contains quite some files, as I treat various inheritance properties, a proof that finite groups are amenable and amenability via Folner sequences. </p>
<p>Where should I place these files? Is making a folder group_theory/amenable a good idea?</p>
<p>As pull-requests should be <code>small, self-contained pieces</code>, (how) should I split up the work into pull requests? Is it ok to make a single pull request or should I make requests for each single file? (The project is rather self-contained and only relies on things that have already been accepted into the mathlib).</p>

<li>instead of using <code>continuous_bounded_function</code>, you may use l^infty via <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/lp">docs#lp</a>, so you don't need to deal with continuity at all. (Of course it would be nicer if we generalize from discrete groups to locally compact Hausdorff groups, where we'd consider the L^infty space w.r.t. the Haar measure (see Wikipedia).)</li>
</ul>

<p>Your're right. I feel like I should state this for <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/topological_group">docs#topological_group</a>  . (I just rewrote the definition to topological groups)</p>

<ul>
<li>instead of using the existence of an invariant mean on the space of bounded functions as the main definition, we may use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amenable_group#Case_of_discrete_groups">existence of an invariant finitely additive measure</a>, which seems simpler. The mean could be obtained by "Lebesgue integration" and the mathlib version requires a countably-additive measure, probably because we don't have finitely-additive measure as a def? Is a refactor in order?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I mainly chose the definition via invariant means because I felt that it would be easier to prove that extensions of amenable groups by amenable groups are amenable (see PR  <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/16578">#16578</a>) using this definition, rather than using the existence of finitely additive, invariant measures.</p>

<p>I just opened <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/16601">#16601</a> which allows you to replace positivity by monotonicity. But to make use of that, we need the partial order on the function space. We actually have <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/bounded_continuous_function.partial_order">docs#bounded_continuous_function.partial_order</a>, so in your current setting you can directly do the replacement. However I think using continuous function is morally wrong: if you only want to deal with discrete groups you should use <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/lp">docs#lp</a> and for the general case you should use <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/measure_theory.Lp">docs#measure_theory.Lp</a> with <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/measure_theory.measure.haar_measure">docs#measure_theory.measure.haar_measure</a> (with p = ⊤, i.e. infinity); in either case, continuous functions don't show up. However, these spaces apparently don't have partial order instances on them; for <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/lp">docs#lp</a> it would be easy and for <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/measure_theory.Lp">docs#measure_theory.Lp</a> we could just transfer the instance <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/measure_theory.ae_eq_fun.partial_order">docs#measure_theory.ae_eq_fun.partial_order</a>. Maybe we should also generalize the theory of means to function spaces that <code>has_one</code>. Let me tag <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="387244">@Yaël Dillies</span> for his insights.</p>
<p>There are currently <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/search?q=author%3Amatthias567+is%3Apr&amp;type=issues">six open PRs about amenable groups</a>, and we should first focus on <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/16574">#16574</a> to get the basic definitions fixed. Many proofs could be golfed (for mathematically trivial proofs we prefer one-line rw/simp proofs instead of calc), but not before we agree upon the fundamental design.</p>

<p>I did not look at those PRs so I am not sure of what you need but we do have some order properties for Lp. See <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/measure_theory.Lp.normed_lattice_add_comm_group">docs#measure_theory.Lp.normed_lattice_add_comm_group</a> and other lemmas in the lp_order file.</p>

<p>Thanks! I only looked for partial_order and I'm glad to learn about the existence of the stronger bundled instance!</p>
<p>Personally I find the noncanonical <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/measure_theory.ae_eq_fun.has_coe_to_fun">docs#measure_theory.ae_eq_fun.has_coe_to_fun</a> very strange. Do you know what it's useful for?</p>

<li>instead of <code>positivity</code> you may use <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/monotone">docs#monotone</a>, but mathlib doesn't seem to have the fact that monotonicity is equivalent to positivity for ordered add_groups. This is related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_linear_functional">positive linear functionals</a>; by the way do we have the Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem?</li>
</ul>

<p>Hey, sorry for not giving the updates on this one! <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="513978">@Jesse Reimann</span> has a sorry-free proof of the Riesz-Markov-Kakutani representation theorem for compact Hausdorff spaces. <span aria-label="tada" class="emoji emoji-1f389" role="img" title="tada">:tada:</span></p>
<p>(I imagine many people will instinctively feel like mathlib should have the locally compact generality at once, but I would argue that the compact case should have a separate implementation because several minor things connect to different existing things in a genuinely different/stronger way than in the locally compact case.)</p>
<p>The fact that Jesse was working on this was discussed <a href="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/radon.20measures/near/291142205">here</a>. We forgot to announce the completion of the proof, but that's indeed done. I hope that after some cleaning up, this could also lead to PRs of the Riesz-Markov-Kakutani to mathlib.</p>
