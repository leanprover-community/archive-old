<p>Hi! I'm a visiting assistant professor of mathematics at St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota - just one year out of my PhD. I've recently played through the Natural Number Game &amp; seen Kevin Buzzard's talks about the future of mathematics. This is my first experience with computer proof verification and I'm very intrigued to continue and possibly see how I (and/or students I end up working with, but for a very long time probably just I) could contribute to this project!</p>

<p>Pick some mathematics you think is fun, see what's already in mathlib, and ask here for advice or warnings regarding whatever the obvious next step is! :-)</p>
