<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Suppose I want to prove an arbitrary statement; say for example <code>p  → (q  → p)</code> with <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> propositions. I was  wondering why Lean doesn't allow me to make assumptions which are not at all helpful or useful for the proof. I.e., why do I get the "failed to unify" error when trying to <code>assume hpq : p  ∧ q</code>. Is there another way of introducing statements like these in your proofs ? </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><code>assume</code>  isn't for "making assumptions", its for "giving names to the things you already stated as an assumption in your goal"</p>

<p>Ah, yes, that makes sense., thanks! Then I can rephrase my question to: "is there a way of making arbitrary assumptions, which do not necessarily have anything to do with my goal?"</p>

<p>What does it mean to do that, in an ordinary pen-and-paper proof?</p>

<p>Obviously if you can assume anything, like <code>false</code>, you can prove whatever you like</p>

<p>So probably you are really doing something like either introducing and then proving an intermediate statement, or doing an analysis by cases</p>

<p>It does not really contribute anything in an ordinary pen-and-paper proof. It it just that in an ordinary pen-and-paper proof you can just assume anything you want, however, it wont bring you even the slightest closer to proving your goal.</p>

<p>Right, so in that case the Lean equivalent is to simply not do it!</p>

<p>Normally I would ask for an example of a proof where you want to do something like this, but it sounds like you already agree that it can never happen.</p>

<p>Hah, yes I figured that it is not helpful for writing an actual proof, but I was just wondering if it was possible at all. There is indeed not an example of a proof in which this is helpful.</p>

<p>The lean equivalent depends on what you want to prove after you have made your assumption. If your goal is <code>G</code> and you want to assume <code>A</code> and prove <code>G</code>, then deduce <code>not A</code>, then it's <code>by_cases</code>. If you want to assume <code>A</code> and prove <code>B</code> in the course of a proof of <code>G</code>, then that's <code>have : A -&gt; B</code></p>

<p>these moves are not completely useless, they introduce a fact to your context that you can then use in the proof of the goal (which you still have to get back to after you have proved your hypothetical)</p>

<p>But it seems that in these cases the assumptions do have a direct use in your proof. I was more looking for something which really does not help anything in the final proof, like the example I gave in my opening post.</p>

<p>Sure, you can even write <code>0 = 1</code> on a paper. The paper won't complain.</p>
