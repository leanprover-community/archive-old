<p>OK, I think I'm wrapping my head around it, though I will need a few digestion days. Thanks!</p>

<p>In case you like this sort of explanation, the relationship between sets and subtypes is that the following commutative diagram is a pullback diagram:</p>
<p><a href="/user_uploads/3121/AO3RoIEl1YTVmzA74mLK29Ad/image.png">image.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/3121/AO3RoIEl1YTVmzA74mLK29Ad/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/3121/AO3RoIEl1YTVmzA74mLK29Ad/image.png"></a></div><p>The <code>true -&gt; Prop</code> map send the proof of <code>true</code> to <code>true</code> itself (I could have also done <code>Unit -&gt; Prop</code>; any domain that's a singleton works). This map is a <a href="http://nlab-pages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nlab/show/subobject+classifier">subobject classifier</a>.</p>
<p>The type <code>set α</code> is a synonym for <code>α → Prop</code>, which is the type of the bottom map.  Given an injection <code>f : β → α</code>, there is a unique map <code>β → ↥s</code>, where <code>s : set α</code> is the image of <code>f</code>, and where this map fits in a commuting triangle with <code>f</code> and <code>↥s → α</code>.</p>
<p><code>subtype</code> gives a universal construction for these <code>↥s</code> types.</p>

<p>So, sets on <code>α</code> and isomorphism classes of injective maps to <code>α</code> are "the same" (at least conceptually), which justifies the coercion from sets to types via <code>subtype</code>.</p>

<p>Yeah, I was just piecing together the fact that a set is just a predicate over the type at hand, and wondering if the subobject classifier concept tied in, here.</p>

<p>A subset in Lean is a term, and a subtype is a type. So, for example, you can't have functions from or to subsets (I mean, you can, but you have to promote them to subtypes first)</p>

<p>Mmh, that's something I hadn't thought of.</p>
