<p>Suppose I am trying to prove something is a commutative group, and for this I need to build a function add. There is a lemma that tells me that under some hypotheses, that are satisfied in my case, there exists a map with certain properties. I need to use that map to build my add function, however in order to get the map I need to give this lemma the hypotheses it wants and in order to do it I switch into tactic mode. After I give it the hypotheses I get an hypothesis of the forms \esists f, ... and I need to get that <code>f</code>. However, I cannot use <code>cases</code> as my goal is not a <code>prop</code>. What can I do? It is really hard for me to create a mwe now as there's a lot of code in between what I am doing and the current version of Mathlib I think</p>

<p>where <code>hyp</code> is the hypothesis of the form <code>\ex f, p f</code>, and <code>f</code> will be the function that satisfies <code>hf : p f</code></p>

<p>with obtain, I guess you'd need to see the code?</p>

<p>Sounds like <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/classical.some">docs#classical.some</a> is what you want? You can use that to get something from an exists, and <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/classical.some_spec">docs#classical.some_spec</a> to show that that term has the right property.</p>

<p>It also sounds like maybe the lemma you use should not have been a lemma at all, but rather a def</p>

<p>It is actually a definition but it there is still an exists in it. It is analogous to the definition of topological fiber bundle:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">is_topological_fiber_bundle</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Prop</span> <span class="o">:=</span>
<span class="bp">∀</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Z</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="bp">∃</span><span class="n">e</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">bundle_trivialization</span> <span class="n">F</span> <span class="n">proj</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="err">∈</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">source</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>I have my <code>x</code> where I want to get my trivialization and I need to use <code>e</code> but I can't manage to extract it. I will try Alex's suggestion</p>

<p>Actually what I was trying to do was stupid and I changed everything but thanks a lot for the help!</p>
