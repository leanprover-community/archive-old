<p>Hi. I'm currently working through the tutorial "Mathematics in Lean". In Section 2.2 "Proving Identities in Algebraic Structures" one is asked to "reprove" theorems from the library. One of the first is neg_add_cancel_right, which is a + b + -b=a. However, if I do #check neg_add_cancel_right later on to check what is in the library it tells me that this is a + -b + b = a.</p>

<p>It's likely that this was renamed since that part of the text was written.</p>

<p>Hmm, actually, I checked and it's probably just a typo / difference in applying naming conventions. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110865">@Jeremy Avigad</span></p>

<p>According to <code>library_search</code>, <code>a + b + -b = a</code> can be proved by <code>add_neg_eq_of_eq_add rfl</code>.</p>

<p>Thanks for catching that! We'll fix it.</p>

<p>The correct name is <code>add_neg_cancel_right</code> (which is what it should be).</p>
