<p>It seems to me that induction is basically just the recursion scheme catamorphism. Is that actually the case? If so, are there tactics for the other recursion schemes?</p>

<p>I don't know the category theory to answer your question fully, but note that there is an <code>induction x using some_custom_scheme</code> variant of the <code>induction</code> tactic.</p>

<p>I don’t know what we already have, but it might be interesting to try implementing other revision schemes as in, e.g. Hinze, Wu &amp; Gibbons “Unifying Structured Recursion Schemes”</p>

<p>For those looking for the paper "Unifying Structured Recursion Schemes" by Hinze, Wu &amp; Gibbons (<a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/jeremy.gibbons/publications/urs.pdf">pdf</a>)</p>
