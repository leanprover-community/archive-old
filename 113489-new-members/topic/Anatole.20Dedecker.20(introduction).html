<p>Hello everyone, I'm a first-year undergraduate in maths and computer science at Universite Paris Saclay (France), and I have been introduced to lean by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> . I am not familiar with Zulip, so let me know if I do anything wrong !</p>
<p>Although the course was more about formalization in general than about Lean itself, I got really interested in the language and I think I start to get used to using it. I'm mostly using it for fun (yes, that's my kind of fun), but that doesn't mean I give up when I'm stuck (it turns out to be the opposite). </p>
<p>Recently I also started to approach a bit more the computer science side of Lean. In particular, I've been trying to encode inside Lean a game we had to code in C++ at the beginning of the year, and it is really interesting (although I've got a lot of performances problem), so I might dive a little bit deeper to this side. </p>
<p>Anyways, I'm really interested in doing more lean. I'm currently playing the Natural Number Game, but if you have any suggestion of other things to do, I'll take it. I can also help to do more "useful" things, for example translating between French and English, so if there are any project where an undergraduate could help, let me know !</p>
<p>TL;DR : Hello everyone !</p>

<p>I was using <code>nat</code> for computing purposes, which, as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> told me, doesn't seem to be a good idea <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span></p>

<p>It is not much used. It can be used as a proof that <code>nat</code> can be viewed as an inductive over binary strings, and it can also be used for efficient nat computation <em>in the kernel</em></p>

<p>However, we generally try to avoid computation in the kernel altogether because lean is better at checking explicit proofs than "heavy refl" proofs</p>

<p>If you are interested as Lean as a programming language then going straight from C++ to Lean is a very long jump, especially since we have very little documentation on this topic. Do you already know a functional programming language? If no then the more or less canonical next step is to read <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com">learnyouahaskell.com</a>. You should do that at some point, even independently of Lean. It's a very good way to broaden your perspective on programming, and it's very interesting, although a lot of it is about solving issues created by the masochistic idea of functional programming (the code name here is monad).</p>

<p>Also, if you are serious about using Lean as a programming language, you may want to go directly to Lean 4. It's not yet ready as a proof assistant but it's already a much better programming language if I understand correctly.</p>

<p>I do know functional languages (at least in theory, i haven't used them a lot though), and I encoded the game in a way I consider being functional-style, so really different from the C++ approach of course. I was actually quite close of it working (with a lot of <code>sorry</code> though, because proofs are often required when working with <code>{n : nat // n &lt; p}</code>), but it was <strong>really</strong> inefficient, and I couldn't find why it was. I'll have a look at Haskell anyway, and maybe making the game in Haskell will help me with the lean implementation.</p>
