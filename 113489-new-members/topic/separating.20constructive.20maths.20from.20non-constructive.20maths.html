<p>Hi there, I want to make sure my lean code and proofs are such that I have any nonconstructive proofs or non-computable functions separate from constructive proofs and computable functions.  I am aware that you can specifically label functions non-computable and introduce explicitly a classical locale to allow 'normal' maths flexibility (which is great).  But equally I am concerned that when I want everything constructive and/or computable that I might be importing something that uses non-computability or non-constructive proofs accidentally. How does Lean (3 and 4 if they are different!) handle this?</p>

<p>You can ensure this manually by using <code>#print axioms declName</code> I guess it could also be turned into an automatic sort of thing as a meta program in Lean 4 rather easily.</p>

<p>DId we end up implementing <code>@[intuit]</code>?</p>
