<p>Hello everyone from an IT developer who got started with Lean recently. No previous experience with functional programming. Read through manual up to chapter 6, went through almost all the natural numbers game and the first two files in the tutorial. I'm sure I will have a lot of questions. Is it ok to post them here? Zulip is new for me also but seems very similar to Slack.</p>
