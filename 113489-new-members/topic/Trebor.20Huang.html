<p>Hi everyone! I've asked a few newcomer questions here, but never introduced myself.</p>
<p>I'm an undergrad student in Tsinghua University. Previously I wrote quite a bit of Agda, primarily concerning <a href="https://github.com/Trebor-Huang/agda-linear">type theoretic</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/Trebor-Huang/6c5cd87fff8b50d23411a034c59daabb">constructive math</a>. I also <a href="https://github.com/Trebor-Huang/elab">code</a> in Haskell.</p>
<p>I'm still trying to get used to Lean's syntax, but hopefully that'll be quick. I'm interested in doing metaprogramming and porting to Lean4. And, as a math undergrad, I would also like to see what I can contribute to mathlib.</p>
<p>This community is awesome and helpful, I've been learning a lot here!</p>
