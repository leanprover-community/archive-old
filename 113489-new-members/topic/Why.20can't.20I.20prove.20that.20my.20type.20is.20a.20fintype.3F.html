<p>I am trying to formalize some results on context free grammars. I am trying to construct a grammar using inductive types, and one of the conditions for a context free grammar is that the rules are finite. Consider the following example,</p>

<p>too bad I don't speak computer science even though I'm a programmer <span aria-label="joy" class="emoji emoji-1f602" role="img" title="joy">:joy:</span> but <code>fintype rs</code> looks very very wrong to me, can you explain what you mean by that?</p>
<p>the reason you're getting the error is because <code>rs</code> lives in the Prop universe but fintype doesn't accept that</p>

<p>In the lean the amount of introduction rules of all inductive types are all finite. <code>fintype</code> formalizes another concept, namely that you can only construct finitely many distinct values of that type which is different of what you are trying to show <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="370446">@Saif Ghobash</span></p>

<p>The error message says everything: <code>fintype rs</code> <strong>does not make sense</strong>. <code>rs</code> is a function, not a type. What you might be confused by is that <code>v → list (v ⊕ t) → Prop</code> is itself a type, but what we're interested in is the fact that its terms are themselves types.</p>

<p>In order to state that the set of rules is finite, you need a type which enumerates the rules. I think you want something like<br>
<code>inductive r | r1 | r2</code> (which you can prove is a <code>fintype</code>)<br>
and then a function <code>r -&gt; (v × list (v ⊕ t))</code> (or two separate functions) which encodes the contents of the rules.</p>
