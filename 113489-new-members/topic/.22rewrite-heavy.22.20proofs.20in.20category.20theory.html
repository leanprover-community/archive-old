<p>Hey everyone! <br>
I've been fiddling around with monads in the current (lean3) mathlib and tried to show the simple fact that a morphism of right adjoint (i.e a triangle that is commutative up to some nat iso whit morphisms to the base being right adjoints) induces a morphism between their monads, and it looks to me that the fact that the morphism one can define is indeed a morphism leads to the ugly kind of proof where you have to explain each rewrite steps because the simplifications one would expect don't happen, and it ends up looking <a href="https://gist.github.com/robin-carlier/aa16d5d590530737d45c287eb00f25b4">like this</a> (this code should be self-contained enough and should work if put in category_theory/monad). <br>
I feel like I am going the wrong way about it. Are there any magical simplifications lemma or tactics I am missing or is this just the way things are?</p>

<p>(I also feel like this "private lemma" can be removed as it already exists in the bicategory part, but it seems to me that to invoke the bicategory verions one would have to tell lean to work in the bicategory Cat for everything involed, which would imply a lot of Cat.of everywhere, and I'm not sure if it's actually worth)</p>
