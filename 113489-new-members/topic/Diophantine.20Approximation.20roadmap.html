<p>Me and a fellow colleague were interested in trying to get our hands dirty with Lean and were thinking to start a project to formalize some basic Diophantine Approximation results with the (longterm) goal to prove Thue's and Roth's Theorems (and possibly their applications to solutions of Diophantine Equations). <br>
Would that be of interested of the community? What is the best way to start other than create the lean file, do the work, and then have it somewhere on Github for people to see it?</p>

<p>In addition to helping you finish your project more quickly, the community is producing intro materials, most notably <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/">#mil</a>. This development is guided in part by questions from mathematicians on zulip</p>

<p>Diophantine approximation sounds great! You might be interested in checking  out some of <br>

<p>Since this is material we'd love to have in mathlib, it may make sense to just work in a branch of mathlib, rather than a separate repository.</p>

<p>(Getting material through the PR process is extra work, sometimes a lot of extra work, but hopefully your code ends up better, you learn a lot about Lean from the process, and the mathematical development is then available and easily usable by everyone else.)</p>

<p>If you want permission to push to non-master branches of the main repository of mathlib, just ask here. (Alternatively, you can always fork the mathlib repository on github. The main advantages of working in a branch on the main repository are that you get the benefit of olean files built by our continuous integration setup, and during the review process of a PR it's a little easier for reviewers.)</p>

<p>Looks like working on a branch of mathlib makes the most sense then. Is it possible to have permission? My GitHub user name is amosturchet. THANKS!</p>
