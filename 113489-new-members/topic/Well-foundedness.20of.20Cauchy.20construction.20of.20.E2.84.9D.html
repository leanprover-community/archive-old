<p>I watched a <a href="https://youtu.be/kcirwIwRIUw?t=1582">video</a>  in which <a href="https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-norman-j-wildberger">Norman Wildberger</a> expresses some anxiety about <a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~tkemp/140A/Construction.of.R.pdf">construction of real numbers as equivalence classes as Cauchy sequences</a>.   He says it's shaky ground but he doesn't seem to get down to brass tacks in the video, just some bullet points.</p>

<p>What <em>does</em> happen, is that may universities don't define the reals at all, but just start their Calculus and Analysis courses with an axiomatic approach to the reals.<br>
A <em>construction</em> of the reals may then appear as an appendix, or maybe in a later course that introduces metric spaces etc...</p>

<p>NJ Wildberger is an ultrafinitist, he doesn't believe in infinite sets (or even very large finite sets/numbers), so cauchy sequences look a little magic and philosophically unjustified from that perspective. The constructivist solution is to talk only about computable sets and sequences, which are enumerable and hence easier to make "tangible"</p>

<p>Alternatively, there is the formalist response (here formalist is referring to the philosophical position, although I think it accords well with formalized mathematics), in which all we are doing is playing a game with symbols, in which case we can use whatever infinite sets we like because they are just notations and we aren't asserting any "real" "existence" of infinite sets, whatever that means.</p>

<p>mathlib has two independent constructions of real numbers (and an isomorphism between those constructions). Of course none of them is circular. The key point for Cauchy sequences is that you get to choose the target of the absolute value. While constructing real numbers you need to use an absolute value on rational numbers with rational values.</p>

<p>Yes, the other construction is Bourbaki reals (which are the real ones of course). I avoids the psychological hurdle of doing Cauchy sequences twice, one before constructing reals and one after. I also places real numbers in the broad context of completions of topological rings.</p>
