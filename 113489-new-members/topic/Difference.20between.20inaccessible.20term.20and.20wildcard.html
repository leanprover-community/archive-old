<p>I was reading the Lean Reference Manual to understand a little bit more about the equation compiler and in the chapter 4.7 it states that a pattern matching definition can be one of the following:</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>a variable, denoting an arbitrary value of the relevant type</li>
<li>an underscore, denoting a wildcard or anonymous variable,</li>
<li>an inaccessible term</li>
<li>a constructor for the inductive type of the corresponding argument, applied to a sequence of patterns</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The first, second and the fourth definitions above I can distinguish easily, but I am having a hard time understanding the value of an <em>inaccessible term</em>. In the reference manual it states that <em>inaccessible terms</em> are the following:</p>
<hr>
<p>"An expression of the form .(t) in a pattern is known as an inaccessible term. It is not viewed as part of<br>
the pattern; rather, it is explicit information that is used by the elaborator and equation compiler when<br>
interpreting the definition. Inaccessible terms do not participate in pattern matching. They are sometimes<br>
needed for a pattern to make sense, for example, when a constructor depends on a parameter that is not<br>
a pattern-matching variable. In other cases, they can be used to inform the equation compiler that certain<br>
arguments do not require a case split, and they can be used to make a definition more readable."</p>
<hr>
<p>To me it seems strange that I simply don't put an <code>_</code> in all entries of the variable that is not useful for the pattern match, instead of <code>_.</code>. Also it seems strange to me that it states the it does not participate in pattern matching, but follows with the following code:</p>

<p>The number of elements of the vector in the second example in above code is not used for a pattern match? I feel that I don't understand very well when I should use this <em>inacessible term</em> in my pattern match.</p>

<p>Note that a late addition to lean 3 automatically infers when a <code>_</code> should be a <code>._</code>, and as a result inaccessible terms are essentially never needed anymore</p>

<p>the only reason you would use it is in an example like <code>add'</code> where for documentation reasons you want to say that the first case has a <code>0</code> for n and the second has <code>n+1</code>. Lean already knows this so you can just write <code>_</code>, but if you want to write <code>0</code> then it has to be <code>.(0)</code> so that it isn't interpreted as a pattern match on <code>n</code></p>
