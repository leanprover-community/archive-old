<p>Hi again. For some reason Lean has become extremely slow and keeps giving me <code>vm check failed: is_mpz(o) (possibly due to incorrect axioms, or sorry)</code> errors. <code>simp</code> also does not seem to work properly, but only sometimes. I've tried redownloading mathlib and restarting vscode. Does anyone have any idea what is going on?</p>

<p>I don't think I've ever seen that before. Is there anything you can tell us about your system or setup that could help us reproduce it?</p>

<p>(I likely know even less about that, but just looking at what that function is, it looks like it's how the Lean VM wraps some libgmp things -- so perhaps you or your OS/package manager have recently updated libgmp and Lean is confused with the new version?)</p>

<p>I'm on macOS. For my setup, I downloaded Lean with the instructions online. The only thing I can think of is that I edited files in .elan and that I didn't build my project. The slowdowns started happening after I tried to split up my <code>fib</code> work between two files. The bugs didn't happen until after I tried to delete and redownload things, though.</p>
<p>I don't know anything about libgmp, unfortunately.</p>

<p>You added mathlib to your project using <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html"><code>leanproject</code></a> right? What exactly do you mean by "tried to delete and redownload things"?</p>

<p>Yes, I used leanproject. I mean I deleted my project and created a new one.</p>

<p>What did you edit in <code>.elan</code>?</p>

<p>Then the <code>fib</code> file in mathlib I was working on complained about <code>gcd_add_self</code> not taking arguments properly. When I tried to fix, Lean slowed down. Instead of deleting <code>gcd_add_self</code> though, I did a bunch of other stuff, and that's when the bugs started appearing.</p>

<p>Editing a file in <code>init</code> without recompiling would cause all of Lean's standard library to recompile in your editor, and then mathlib would have to recompile as well, and that would definitely slow things down. I would suggest reverting the change to <code>init</code> and then recompiling the standard library by running <code>lean --make library/</code>  in <code>.elan/toolchains/leanprover-community-lean-3.23.0/lib/lean</code> (modify the path to point to whatever toolchain you're working with).</p>
<p>Alternatively you could <code>elan toolchain uninstall</code> the messed up version of Lean and then reinstall it.</p>
<p>I'm not sure I understand the <code>vm check failed</code> error though, but doing the above (and then possibly recreating your project / downloading new mathlib oleans using leanproject) should make things fast again.</p>

<p>Well, it took a while, but everything has reset and Lean is running fast again. Thanks!</p>
