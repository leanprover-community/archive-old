<p>In the first proof document, I don't understand the following content. Could anyone please give me some detailed explanations (like the functions of the commands, the constructions of the commands)?<br>

<p>Lean is both a tool for constructing mathematical proofs, and a programming language. Those lines say roughly "we're only going to do mathematics (with classical logic), so ignore some issues that are only relevant for programming"</p>

<p>What does "noncomputable theory" mean? What is the function of that?</p>

<p>(the first on computability, which <code>noncomputable theory</code> affects, and the second on constructive vs. classical logic, which <code>open_locale classical</code> affects)</p>

<p>It means that you can give a definition of <code>foo</code> without giving a true algorithm to compute <code>foo</code>. For example, for any positive integer <code>k</code>Â¸we know that there is an integer <code>f k</code> such that all natural numbers can be written using at most  <code>f k</code> powers (for example all numbers are the sum of 4 squares).  This <code>f</code> is, for a mathematician , a perfectly defined function (take <code>f k</code> minimal if you want). But there is no algorithm to compute it, at least not in this definition</p>

<p>Actually it's a tricky theorem that there <em>is</em> an algorithm to compute Riccardo's f, because for k&gt;=3 it turns out that basically the hardest number to write as a sum of k'th powers is the number just less than the largest multiple of 2^k which is less than 3^k (e.g. 23 is hard to write as a sum of natural cubes, you'll need 9, and f(3)=9). This of course doesn't change the fact that one wants to be able to reason about the function without proving the hard theorem I just mentioned above. No algorithm is known to compute the "all sufficiently large n" version of Riccardo's function (which is actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waring%27s_problem">Waring's function</a> -- all sufficiently large naturals are definitely the sum of 7 natural cubes, it is conjectured that all n&gt;7373170279850 are the sum of 4 natural cubes, but whether the "magic number" for cubes is 4, 5, 6 or 7 is unknown. Andrej Bauer pointed out to me that you can make this function computable, but it then maps to a target space which is not computably isomorphic to the naturals (but which is classically isomorphic to them).</p>
