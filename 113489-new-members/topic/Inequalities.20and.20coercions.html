<p>In the standard library, there is a lemma <code>int.coe_nat_le_coe_nat_of_le</code> which states that one can coerce both sides of an inequality involving natural numbers to get an inequality involving integers. Is there a similar lemma which performs lifting from the natural numbers to the reals?</p>

<p>There is probably one which works for maps from the naturals to arbitrary totally ordered semirings or something, and you might be able to find it with <code>library_search</code> if you just copy the statement of the lemma above and replace the ints with reals. The reason ints are treated differently is some consequences of a design decision, something about the canonical map from the naturals to the integers being a constructor.</p>

<p>I should also say that the whole point of tactics like <code>norm_cast</code> is to enable the user to not have to ask questions like this. Your question reminds me of the old days</p>

<p>The lemma name might have the word <code>cast</code> in rather than<code>coe</code> , I never worked out the difference</p>

<p>Thanks, using <code>norm_cast</code> made my life much easier <span aria-label="stuck out tongue" class="emoji emoji-1f61d" role="img" title="stuck out tongue">:stuck_out_tongue:</span></p>
