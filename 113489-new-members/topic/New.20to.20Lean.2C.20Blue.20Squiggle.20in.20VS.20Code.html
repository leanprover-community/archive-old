<p>Hello, very new Lean user here</p>
<p>I've been able to get everything installed and work through some basic proofs successfully<br>
I'm noticing in VS Code that although #eval and #check statements are displaying the expected output in infoview,  these lines display with a blue squiggle underneath and show up in the "Problems" pane of VS Code (without any additional information given).</p>
<p>I suspect this indicates that something may be set up incorrectly, but the Lean project appears to be ok. I've tried restarting VS Code and issuing a Lean: Restart command, but it hasn't helped. </p>
<p>Any pointers would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Blue squiggle is fine! (It shows up as "info", the fact that the pane is called "problems" is a bit misleading.)</p>

<p>Thank you for the quick reply - ah so this is the expected behavior?<br>
That would be reassuring.</p>

<p>Yes, it is expected behavior, your system is working</p>
