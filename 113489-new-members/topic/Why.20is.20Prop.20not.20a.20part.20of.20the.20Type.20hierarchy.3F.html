<p>I've had issues such as returning a <code>Prop</code> in a tuple only to find out it does not typecheck. Or not being able to pattern match on membership proofs that are <code>Prop</code>s in regular code. And there were recent issues with putting <code>Prop</code>s in inductive types only to have them not compile.</p>
<p>What is the purpose for splitting the type hierarchy into two? I've never seen this explained up to now, and it feels like some kind of language design error more than anything else. I already know from Agda that things like equalities and inequalities can be regular types, so what is the deal with this?</p>

<p>I am not familiar with the details, but I know that extensional type theory has uniqueness of identity proofs which I think is supposed to make identity proofs equal to each other. Does that cover some of the functionality of proof irrelevance?</p>

<p>I see what you mean. Thinking back to my studies of Cubical Agda, at that time I felt happy that progress on the foundations is being made, but at the end I was left hoping that hundred years from now that work will be done because if not who knows where math will end up.</p>
<p>Since simplicity is a value, let me ask you...how do you feel about Lean being implemented in C++ as opposed to some ML language?</p>

<p>Thanks. I think I now understand the error messages a lot better. In hindsight, I think that a lot of my annoyance that I attributed to Lean over the past few weeks has been due to my own inexperience. Hopefully I will be better prepared for the future now that I am through with this.</p>
