<p>I am very new to lean, and was going through the book "An introduction to lean".</p>
<p>Is there a reason why functions seem to have the signature <code>(p : α → Prop) [_inst_1 : decidable_pred p]</code> rather than <code>(p : α → bool)</code>.</p>
<p>Two examples that I found thus far are <code>list.filter</code> and <code>char.is_punctuation</code>.</p>

<p>"An introduction to Lean" is very out of date. You may want to look at <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/" title="https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/">Theorem Proving in Lean</a> instead. In particular, stuff like <code>[_inst_1 : decidable_pred p]</code> is explained in the chapter on Type Classes.</p>
<p>There are also some easier sources to get into Lean; have you seen the <a href="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/" title="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/">Natural Number Game</a>?</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="123965">@Bryan Gin-ge Chen</span> . Theorem Proving in Lean was next on my reading list. I know about the Natural Number Game but haven't tried it yet.</p>
