<p>I have been working on one repository for some time and not cloning anything new. But today when I tried to clone something new, bash said "binary package was not provided for 'windows'".  I looked at other posts about binary package not provided and people say it's a matter of time. Is it the same case for me here?</p>

<p>Hmm, the version of Lean specified in <a href="https://github.com/ChrisHughes24/Sylow/blob/master/leanpkg.toml">that package's <code>leanpkg.toml</code></a> is <code>"nightly-2018-04-20"</code>. It looks like a binary is available <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean-nightly/releases/tag/nightly-2018-04-20">here</a>, however for some reason <code>elan</code> doesn't seem to be able to pick it up. You might try changing the version string to <code>3.4.1</code> and seeing if that works.</p>

<p>How can I change the version string to 3.4.1? Does that mean I need to change the lean version in leanpkg.toml to "leanprover-community/lean:3.4.1"? It gives me the same error though. Does it have anything to do with my elan installaion? btw I don't understand specifically what's nightly and leanpkg toml. Where can I learn about them? Thank you.</p>

<p>This is a really old project. Does <code>lean --make sylow.lean</code> (and then wait for an hour) work?</p>

<p>This project is pre Leanproject so compilation will be harder.</p>

<p>Lean 3.4.1 predates <code>leanprover-community/lean</code>, so I was suggesting just changing the Lean version to <code>3.4.1</code> directly.</p>

<p>I can confirm that changing the line with `lean_version to:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="TOML"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">lean_version</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"3.4.1"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>and then running <code>leanproject build</code> and waiting for a while (since we don't have olean files that go that far back) successfully builds the project. I'll open a PR. cc: <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110044">@Chris Hughes</span></p>

<p>It still says binary package not provided, but changing the version to 3.4.1 make it work.</p>
