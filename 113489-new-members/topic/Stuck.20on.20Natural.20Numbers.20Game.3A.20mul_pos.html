<p>Hi,<br>
I'm stuck on the first level of Advanced Multiplication World in the Natural Numbers Game.  I've tried all kinds of approaches, but I can't make progress. There must be some tactic which I'm missing.</p>
<p>My  basic strategy is</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the induction tactic</li>
<li>Solve for the easy zero case</li>
<li>Look for a way to use trick (2) given in the hints.  i.e. I want the goal to be <code>false</code> and to have a hypothesis <code>succ(something)=0</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Could anyone give me a hint?  If possible, don't post the solution but give me just enough to allow me make progress</p>

<p>I think the maths proof is something like this.   From the state</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">hd</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">d</span> <span class="bp">≠</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="bp">≠</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">d</span> <span class="bp">*</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="bp">≠</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">,</span>
<span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="bp">≠</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="bp">⊢</span> <span class="n">succ</span> <span class="n">d</span> <span class="bp">*</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="bp">≠</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We know that the successor of a number can never be zero.  <code>succ_ne_zero</code> should take care of that.<br>
We have a hypothesis that <code> b ≠ 0</code>.<br>
We need the fact that multiplying two non-zero numbers results in a non-zero number. <code>hd</code> looks to cover that, but I'm not sure what tactic would use <code>hd</code>to get the goal into the right state for  <code>succ_ne_zero</code></p>

<p>From the state you posted, it looks like you've already made a wrong turn. Your induction hypothesis hd is not strong enough to make progress, because it's about fixed d and you need it for all d. I think you should have encountered that situation a few times before getting to advanced multiplication</p>

<p>Ah. Yes.  So it looks like I don't know the maths proof.  <br>
Also it looks like starting with induction was a wrong move.  <code>cases b with n,</code> and solving the easy case got me to</p>

<p>Notice that using <code>cases</code> instead of <code>induction</code> usually gives you <em>less</em> resources to work with (no induction hypothesis)</p>

<p>OK.  Proof by contradiction feels like a sensible strategy.<br>
Let's imagine that we have two numbers <code>a ≠ 0</code> and <code>b ≠ 0</code> but <code>a*b=0</code>.<br>
Now <code>a*succ(b)=a*b + a</code><br>
but as <code>a*b=0</code>we have<br>
<code>a*succ(b)=a</code><br>
Then with something like <code>mul_one</code> we see that <code>succ(b)=1</code><br>
but then <code>b=0</code></p>
<p>Trying to follow this strategy I can get to</p>

<p>I was able to solve this, but I'm trying to understand quite how the tactics worked.  The solution was a proof by contradiction implemented into lean using <code> exact succ_ne_zero _ hab</code> with a goal of <code>false</code> as recommended in the tricks section.</p>
<p>However the expressions in hypothesis <code>hab</code> which worked are not at all what I expected.   It feels like the <code>exact</code> tactic is doing multiple extra steps for me.   Is there a way to see what lean has replaced <code>_</code> with to help extend my understanding?</p>

<p>What is your proof? Tactics <code>apply</code> and <code>exact</code> can unfold terms up to definitional equality. So, for example, in this proof:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">intros</span> <span class="n">ha</span> <span class="n">hb</span><span class="o">,</span>
<span class="n">cases</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">exact</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">ha</span> <span class="n">rfl</span><span class="o">)</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">elim</span><span class="o">,</span>
<span class="n">cases</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">exact</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">hb</span> <span class="n">rfl</span><span class="o">)</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">elim</span><span class="o">,</span>
<span class="n">apply</span> <span class="n">succ_ne_zero</span><span class="o">,</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Before <code>apply succ_ne_zero</code>, the goal was <code>succ a * succ b ≠ 0</code>, but the <code>apply</code> tactic unfolds it to <code>succ a * b + succ a ≠ 0</code> and then to <code>succ (succ a * b + a) ≠ 0</code>, so it figures out that the argument for <code>succ_ne_zero</code> must be <code>succ a * b + a</code></p>

<p>You could fill in the hole with a random thing like 37 or <code>hab</code> and read the error to find out what it was expecting.</p>

<p>Note that <code>add_succ</code> is true by definition (under the hood its proof is <code>rfl</code>, just like <code>add_zero</code>), but the same does not apply to <code>succ_add</code> or <code>zero_add</code> (under the hood their proofs use the induction axiom).</p>
