<p>by "there" do you mean in your local install or in the online docs? The former might be out of date</p>

<p>I don't know how to go about updating the library but I only started using lean earlier this month and I can't imagine that something this simple would be added this late</p>

<p>Mathlib gets rearranged and reorganized a lot, so its quite possible something this basic was renamed recently, or that it was refactored to look this way only recently. Are you working on a copy of mathlib, or as a dependency in another project?</p>

<p>I'm not completely sure what you mean but I just followed the installation instructions online since early september and have been using whatever copy of mathlib was installed at the time since then</p>
