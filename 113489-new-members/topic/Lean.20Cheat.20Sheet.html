<p>I've been reading (and trying out the exercises in)  many tutorials for Lean. The knowledge absorbed from scattered sources is becoming a memory  burden and I have at least the personal need to create a cheat sheet that has high information density and is well organized for quick reference.</p>
<p>Apparently, I would not be the first to need such a cheat sheet, so I searched Zulip to see if there're already such cheat sheets. But I could not find one that's ideal.</p>
<p>There're:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> 's cheat sheet mentioned <a href="#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/Getting.20started/near/177567831">here</a>, but it's a dead link</li>
<li><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> 's cheat sheet mentioned <a href="#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/the.20complex.20number.20game/near/198480780">here</a>, but it has no direct link and I could not find it</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jldodds/coq-lean-cheatsheet">https://github.com/jldodds/coq-lean-cheatsheet</a> which is a little dated and not so complete, there're better ones in Coq world such as <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2018sp/a5/coq-tactics-cheatsheet.html">https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2018sp/a5/coq-tactics-cheatsheet.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>What I have in mind is something as rich as <a href="https://cheats.rs/">https://cheats.rs/</a> ( it's a long page, please have a quick scroll-down ), it covers all most every aspect of the language and the ecosystem in a concise manner with links to the original sources (there're many open books/tutorials in Rust world too). </p>
<p>Its structuring of contents and its tech stack (see <a href="https://github.com/ralfbiedert/cheats.rs/">its source</a>) are mostly reusable for Lean. I'm motivated to create a prototype and a skeleton for Lean based on it, at least cover the part I know of, distilling information from the books/tutorials that I've read. Just post here (before I even start doing so) to see if anyone has some plans/needs similar in mind.</p>

It refers to a very specific teaching context, it even contains one tactic that is not in mathlib.</p>

<p>In NNG I went for summary, then details, then examples. It might even be best to do summary, then examples, then details, when it comes to docs. I guess the docs can say different things to the hover result, which might want to be more compact in general</p>

<p>As a beginner, I have a not so great first impression of the current tactic docs, I only understand the doc of a tactic after I have a concept about what the tactic does. I'm constantly confused about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Direction: what does the tactic applies to? the goal, the hypotheses, or both? Which tactic should I use if I need to do the same to the opposite direction? (backward proof v.s. forward proof)</li>
<li>Scenario: under what specific circumstances should I think about using the tactic?</li>
<li>Scope: what family does the tactic belong to? what scope of the problem does the family solve? (This is partially addressed by the tags, I'll get back to its issues later)</li>
<li>What: what does the tactics do?</li>
<li>Variants: are there slightly modified versions to also do xxx, yyy?</li>
<li>What else: what else can I try in a similar circumstance? (it's like an ordered tactic chain, such as <code>ac_refl</code>, <code>cc</code>, <code>abel</code> etc., one stronger than the other)</li>
<li>Style: which tactics to use if I want to do the same in another proof style? </li>
<li>Reduce: what if I want to have more control on a tactics that's too smart? (such as from <code>simp</code> to <code>squeeze_simp</code>, <code>simp_only</code>, <code>rw</code> etc.)</li>
<li>Simplify:  how can I simplify a series of steps( which seem to have a pattern ) to just one or few tactics?</li>
<li>Partners: which tactics should I use together with this tactic?</li>
<li>Parameters: what parameters can I pass to the tactics? what do they control? can I just copy-paste a part of the expression? why sometimes copy-paste doesn't work? when can Lean infer them for me?</li>
<li>Equivalents: in informal mathematical proofs, in Coq etc. </li>
</ul>
<p>These questions are usually addressed by searching mathlib source for examples and searching Zulip for Q&amp;A, and most tutorials answered some of them.</p>

<p>Back to the tags, there're 3 major issues of tags:</p>
<ul>
<li>they're not clickable from a tactic and one has to explicitly use the filter function</li>
<li>there're many of them and they're alphabetically ordered and not grouped, and tactics in them are again alphabetically ordered (thus no logical organization)</li>
<li>some tags are underused e.g. conv, category theory, equiv, hypothesis management, monotonicity, transport etc. and not necessarily exhaustive</li>
</ul>
<p>I agree that tags served well for a library reference doc, but they're not exactly a best entry point for beginners to figuring things out due to these issues. Arguably, these issues might not need to be solved within mathlib doc.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="296911">@Utensil Song</span> Thanks for writing up the issue! I think the best way to make progress on this is to pick out some specific tactics where you think the tactic doc entry is poor and then try to rewrite it in a PR or give some concrete suggestions on Zulip or in a Github issue. Also, feel free to chime in on PRs on mathlib if you think the documentation can be improved.</p>
