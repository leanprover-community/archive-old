<p>Hey! My name is Dhruv Bhatia. I've been working with Lean for a couple of semesters (under the amazing <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110596">@Rob Lewis</span> ). We've been working on  new tactic called polyrith which can solve polynomial equalities through polynomial arithmetic on the hypotheses. (This is similar in spirit to how linarith solves linear equalities/inequalities using linear arithmetic on the hypotheses). We think we are at a stage where I can make a pull request, and so I wanted to ask for access to do so. My github username is dhruvbhatia00. Thanks!</p>
