<p>Hi from Norway, I've been spending the last 10 years iterating on an online makerspace solution for enabling rapid prototyping, which covers all major subjects and allows users to combine elements from everything as wood working, chemistry, electronics, etc ... along with math of course.<br>
My plan was to build this and integrating it with Wolfram Mathematica, but Charles from IOG mentioned Lean in his recent video, so I started investigating your project. And I think Lean would be a good match to implement into our Blueprint solution.<br>
We are implementing incentive models and since it is built on top of an open marketplace, Users can sell their mathematical equations, chemical recipes and whatnot alongside other products, tools, designs and code. Later stages will include AI that will enable it to build prototypes for us.</p>
<p>The project aims to enable Industry 5.0, where step 1 is enabling Blueprints that covers all elements, and is reusable back to the industry.</p>
<p>If someone is interested in joining this project, or give feedback once we have included Lean 4 in the Blueprint, feel free to reach out :)<br>
We also have a Discord server: <a href="https://discord.gg/XyxtP43xbT">https://discord.gg/XyxtP43xbT</a></p>
