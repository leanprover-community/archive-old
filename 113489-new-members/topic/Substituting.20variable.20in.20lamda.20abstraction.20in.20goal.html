<p>I am always embarrassed by how difficult it is to prove that 1/n tends to 0 from first principles in Lean :-)</p>

<p>If so, you might be interested in <code>lean_formatter</code> and possibly also the framework used by "Mathematics in Lean".</p>

<p>That's a great way to do it. You should make a little repo where you put up stuff. I was working on some undergraduate problem sheets for analysis with some Imperial first year undergraduates -- I wasn't teaching the course, we were just goofing around. <a href="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/M40002">https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/M40002</a></p>

<p>You should just make a github project for your class, with mathlib as a dependency, and then within <code>src</code> set up a nice directory structure (lectures, problem sheets, exam questions, whatever) and start dumping Lean files in the directories and showing other kids in your class. Explain in your README how to install your project (just copy what I wrote mutatis mutandis) and see if other people contribute.</p>
