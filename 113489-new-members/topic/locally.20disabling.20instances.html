<p>Can one entirely turn off an already imported instance, locally? You can override it by providing something with higher priority, and I was hoping that <code>[priority 0]</code> might remove it from the search, but that doesn't seem to happen.</p>

<p>I would also like to be able to do this.</p>

<p><code>priority 0</code> cannot be the answer, this is what we use for decidability to ensure it is used only after all actual instances. But we do want to use it</p>

<p>we need priority to take a <code>with_bot nat</code></p>

<p>Why do you need to disable an instance? Maybe there's another way to approach the issue</p>

<p>I asked this mostly for the sake of teaching students about instances -- I had them building by hand some instances that already existed, and it was sometimes confusing whether library or hand-built instances were being used.</p>

<p>You could try using synonyms for the types you're building instances for. For instance, if you want the students to build an instance of <code>monoid nat</code>, write a definition <code>def natural := nat</code> and then an instance <code>monoid natural</code></p>
