<p>Hi, I'm Daniel. I got here somehow via <a href="http://lobste.rs">lobste.rs</a> (I think?) via the natural number game, which is fun and excellent! I have been through a quarter or so of Software Foundations with Coq, but I'm very much a beginner with Lean. I am not a mathematician, formal math education ended for me with Calc 2 ~15 years ago. I don't really want to be a bother but I do have some questions about what is going on in some of the levels of the game. Is there a place for very beginner-ish questions?</p>

<p>This stream is the place you're looking for. Be sure to start a new topic for each question, and indicate clearly the level you are talking about (pasting the url) and what you've tried.</p>
