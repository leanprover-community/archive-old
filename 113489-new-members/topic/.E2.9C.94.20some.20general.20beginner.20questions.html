<p>Thank you for the responses everyone. Definitely helpful.  As <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="130384">@Riccardo Brasca</span>  suggests I probably just need to keep playing around (and yes, it certainly makes sense to not be dividing stuff living in nat).</p>

<p>For discovering useful lemmas, I find <code>library_search</code> very helpful but I rarely get anything helpful from <code>suggest</code>.  Another useful general-purpose tactic is <code>tidy?</code>, which does as much as it can to solve the problem and then reports back the exact sequence of tactics it found.  The output of <code>tidy?</code> is often ugly and overpowered, but you can usually edit it down to something more sensible that gets the job done.</p>

<p>So, for example, <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#linarith">tactic#linarith</a> explains what <code>linarith</code> does and how to use it without having to read the source code.</p>

<p>mathlib code is not intended to be read as an inert block of text on the screen (as you might read Python code, for example).  For almost any proof more than a couple of lines long the only way to follow it is interactively by stepping through it in an editor like Visual Studio Code, where you can see what happens to the premises and the goal at each step.</p>

<p>Another good method of discovery is to cast wishes with <code>have</code> and then make them come true with <code>library_search</code> <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span> That is, you say "I'm pretty sure XYZ must be true",  and write <code>have : XYZ, { sorry }</code>.  Then you ask <code>library_search</code> to fill in the <code>sorry</code>.  You can sometimes outline the whole structure of a proof like this, formalising each sentence that a mathematician would write in an informal proof, and then go back and fill in all the <code>sorry</code>s once Lean has confirmed that this sequence of stepping-stones really would get you to the goal.</p>

<p>If you're using an editor with suggested auto-completions like VS Code then you can take advantage of mathlib's naming convention.  For example, if you start typing <code>have := nat.mul_sub</code> then the editor will open a list of theorems containing those characters in that order, which hopefully will include something involving multiplication and subtraction of natural numbers.</p>

<p>Yes, this is a basic one that I saw somewhere. </p>

<p>I've gotten spoiled, I see. In Python world, the code itself is often good documentation! Besides that, I kept googling and poking around the LEAN documentation instead of realizing that mathlib is separate and I should look there too. Thanks! From the mathlib docs <code>tidy?</code> looks the tool I really was hoping would exist and to try with some basic exercises.</p>

<p>Note that when it comes to readability, in Lean there is quite a difference in learning curve between <em>statements</em> and <em>proofs</em>.<br>
Generally, the statements and definitions should be quite readable.<br>
Proofs are a different beast.</p>
