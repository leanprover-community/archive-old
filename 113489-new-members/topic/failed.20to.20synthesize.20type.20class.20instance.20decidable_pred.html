<p>Seems like destructuring is not very compatible with automatic inference of decidability?</p>

<p>You can see exactly the problem which occurs. Using <code>λ ⟨ a, b ⟩</code> is fine for proving theorems, but causes problems when making definitions because of the way Lean 3 takes this apart internally. Stick to the bottom one.</p>

<p>I wonder, why exactly doesn't this destructuring work in this situation? it would be a lot more readable to use inline functions of product types with destructuring syntax. I don't quite understand what the <code>failed to synthesize type class instance</code> error means here</p>

<p>You can see what happens from the error I guess. Lean can't see through the <code>test._match_1</code> and I'm not sure if we can get to it to mark it reducible.</p>

<p>I was writing code for undergraduates last week and I did find this really annoying -- I defined a map on nat^2 by f(x)=something involving x.1 and x.2, and then I immediately wrote a lemma saying that f((a,b)) was the same thing but involving a and b. At the time I thought it looked clunky but this is what people have been doing in the past. Until January there were many requests from users for which the answer was "we can't do anything about it, it's in core" but now we have control of core we can do more things. I have no idea whether we can do something about this though. I can't remember whether have people have thought about it seriously since January -- I think a lot of us are just resigned to the x.1, x.2 thing.</p>

<p>so the problem is that lean sees the pair, and it's like well who knows if a lambda on a pair is decidable, and then it fails because it does not know that a lambda on a pair is decidable when the lambda is decidable on each of the parts</p>

<p>if the parser magic is inserting <code>foo</code> everywhere, why does it work differently for a human to put <code>foo.1</code> and <code>foo.2</code> throughout the expression? because there's an extra <code>def</code> this way?</p>

<p>foo.1 and foo.2 don't make new definitions</p>
