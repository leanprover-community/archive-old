<p>I just found out about the Leanprover Zulip chat. I have a bit of experience with the Lean prover, going through the official "theorem proving with Lean" tutorial. I have some basic questions about how to formalize math in Lean, and I'm wondering where I should ask them: Should I create a new topic for a question? Should I do so in the "new members" stream? (I have not used Zulip before, and I don't know the best practices).</p>

<p>Welcome! Yes, feel free to create new topics for your questions in the "new members" stream.</p>
