<p>The anonymous constructor brackets are for types with a single constructor. They look at the expected type to figure out what they should be replaced with.</p>
<p>There's a rule that you can merge angle brackets that are right-nested.  This is being used in your example, where fully bracketed the expression passed to <code>exact</code> would be <code>⟨(y-x)/2, ⟨by linarith, by linarith⟩⟩</code>.</p>

<p>Great. Thanks Kyle. I didn't find the Tutorial too clear on what is really going on here. What you've written here is exactly what I was asking, and now I get it. Sigma types are like a generalisation of a cartesian product for dependent type theory. The normal parentheses I was referring to are in the example line, that is:  (∀ ε &gt; 0, y ≤ x + ε). You can see the similarity I was finding confusing.  The right associativity was not confusing at all as it is explained in the Tutorial.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="410678">@Robert Watson</span> The parentheses around the forall are different, and this is about precedence. If it had been <code>∀ ε &gt; 0, y ≤ x + ε → y ≤ x</code>, it would parse as <code>∀ ε &gt; 0, (y ≤ x + ε → y ≤ x)</code>, which isn't what you'd want. (By the way, foralls are "pi types" rather than "sigma types".)</p>

<p>If it had been 'exists' would it still be normal brackets? Could angle brackets have been used too?</p>

<p>If it had been <code>exists</code>, it'd have the same parentheses considerations. In Lean, anything that has a comma generally means "the parse the next expression as far as possible", so you need parentheses to prevent the forall or exists from capturing the stuff from the function/implication arrow onward.</p>
<p>Angle brackets are only for constructing terms/proofs of a type/prop.  The forall and exists themselves are propositions.</p>

<p>Something that takes a little getting used to in Lean is that the comma is not just an element separator. You'll find (and maybe even find yourself writing) code that looks like <code>⟨λ x, x + 1, λ y, 2 * y, 3⟩</code>, but you have to know it means <code>⟨(λ x, x + 1), (λ y, 2 * y), 3⟩</code>.</p>

<p>What's the best way to learn this stuff as I find it is really slowing me down with the Tutorials? I tried to use (*) for groupings with rewrite and got into all sorts of a mess in another thread here, so I learnt <em>not</em> to do that! - I had to use square brackets there!</p>

<p>Are you in VS Code? You can move your mouse over <code>rw</code> to see a terse description of the syntax. There's also documentation such as <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#rw%20/%20rewrite">https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#rw%20/%20rewrite</a></p>

<p>In that other thread, the problem with the parentheses with <code>rw</code> was that the <code>&lt;-</code> is part of the <code>rw</code> syntax.</p>

<p>If you put parentheses around it, then you're asking Lean to parse the <code>&lt;-</code> as if it were part of an expression, but there's no interpretation of <code>&lt;-</code> as an expression (at least by default).</p>

<p>The square brackets are a way to give <code>rw</code> multiple rewrites. Square brackets are somewhat traditional in functional programming to mean ordered lists.</p>
