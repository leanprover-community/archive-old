<p>Hey guys. </p>
<p>I have a question. <br>
I have the following hypothesis:  <code>h: solver._match_1 (find_valuation (form.FAnd p1 p2)) = tt</code></p>
<p>My goal is the following: <code>solver._match_1 (find_valuation p1) = tt</code></p>
<p>Two questions: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>as you can see from the hypothesis and the goal, their form is very similar. In fact both are  <code>solver.match_1  ... = tt</code>. Is there a way to get rid of these terms? So I end up with a hypothesis of <code>find_valuation (form.FAnd p1 p2)</code> and a goal of <code>find_valuation p1</code> or am I saying something ridiculous? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I see the term _match_1. I assume this is introduced by a pattern match I perform in the solver definition. What exactly does this do?</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>A <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mwe.html">#mwe</a> would be helpful so we can give better advice for your exact situation.</p>
<ol>
<li>it sounds like you are asking for  <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#convert">tactic#convert</a> maybe?</li>
<li>its a little strange that you are seeing that in the first place, and makes me think you unfolded your definitions too much already</li>
</ol>
