<p>Where are the floating point numbers in lean?</p>

<p>there is <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/native.float">docs#native.float</a> for actual floats in the interpreter, and <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/fp.float">docs#fp.float</a> is an (experimental) model of IEEE floats in mathlib</p>

<p>Unless you ask in <a class="stream" data-stream-id="270676" href="/#narrow/stream/270676-lean4">#lean4</a> or explicitly say that you're asking about Lean 4, the common response will likely assume that you're asking about Lean 3</p>

<p>So its a type? Why isnâ€™t it in the manual. Or maybe it is</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="467926">@J. O.</span> Please, in this thread you are interacting with volunteers that are trying to be helpful. Recently you've been coming across quite negatively or dismissive. Lean 4 is not a polished product. Lean 3 is a community maintained project. We aren't selling anything. We're trying out tons of things, and doing experiments that have never been done before. Most of what's going on is like construction workers on a construction site. And since most of us are those "construction workers", we really enjoy being at the construction site.<br>
I encourage you to be more kind in what you write.</p>
