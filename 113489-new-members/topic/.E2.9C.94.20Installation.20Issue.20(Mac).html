<p>Yes I am on a Macbook Air M1. Thank you for your help, I think I have it working now! I used the steps in the linked thread along with <a href="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/development/installing-intel-based-packages-using-homebrew-on-the-m1-mac/">https://www.wisdomgeek.com/development/installing-intel-based-packages-using-homebrew-on-the-m1-mac/</a>  and then tried the whole process again from the step by step page and eventually got it working.</p>

<p>Great to hear!</p>
<p>We should really add instructions to our install page for M1 Macs. If you feel up to it, you can make a pull request by clicking on the pencil icon to "Edit this file" <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/leanprover-community.github.io/blob/newsite/templates/install/macos.md">here</a>. Otherwise, any additional detail you can give here would be helpful.</p>

<p>We also should warn about this in the installer I guess. <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib-tools/issues/107">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib-tools/issues/107</a></p>

<p>I'm afraid I have no idea how to use Github and I am not very experienced with computery things like Homebrew but I can try to give more detail if that is okay. </p>
<p>Basically the issue was I had the M1 version of Homebrew installed but Lean required me to use the intel version. The link I copied into my initial reply was the instructions I followed to install Homebrew again. After I did that, the command that does everything in one didn't work, so I again had to follow the step by step page. I'm afraid I can't remember how I finally got elan to work but I know I also had issues with gmp as I kept getting errors saying directory not empty; I fixed this by manually going into the folder and deleting what was in it (I know that was a bit risky!). At one of the stages I also kept getting the error <code>Error: An unexpected error occurred during the 'brew link' step: The formula built, but is not symlinked</code> but I fixed that using brew link.</p>
<p>I'm sorry this isn't enough detail to instruct others, unfortunately my understanding of Terminal and Homebrew etc is not strong enough to understand exactly what is happening at each stage, and I didn't note down what my problems were. I hope this helps anyway!</p>

<p>No worries, thanks for the detailed reply and happy Lean-ing!</p>
