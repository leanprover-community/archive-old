<p>I was looking through <code>https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs_demo/init/function.html</code> for the definition of even/odd function, do these definitions exist in mathlib?</p>

<p>I haven't seen it (which doesn't mean it isn't there!), but if we did have it, then the appropriate level of generality would be something like an involutive linear map on a module over a ring of characteristic different from 2. Any such map decomposes the module into a fixed part, and an anti-fixed part. For even functions (the fixed part) the involution is (lambda x, f x) -&gt; (lambda x, f -x). (Sorry, on mobile)</p>

<p>For the definition you would only need your domain to have a <code>-</code> for even and for the codomain also to have one for <code>odd</code>. To statethe theorem that every function is even+odd you would need an addition and to prove it you'd need an action of the integers on the codomain and the fact that 2 acts invertibly (eg it could be a module for a ring in which <code>is_unit 2</code>)</p>

<p>We have <code>add_hom</code>; an odd function is <code>neg_hom</code>.</p>
