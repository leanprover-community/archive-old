<p>As we have <code>simp</code> and <code>squeeze_simp</code>, is there a similar option for <code>finish</code> please? Or maybe, rather than printing a list of lemmata that were used, I would like to display the end part of the proof (that was just generated) as a term. Can I do it?</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#show_term">tactic#show_term</a> to see the term produced, but it will be very unreadable. You might be able to see the names of a couple of useful things, but in general due to the way finish works it is not really amenable to producing nice tactic scripts.</p>

<p>Also, my experience is that pasting the output of <code>show_term</code> will not work as a valid proof.</p>
