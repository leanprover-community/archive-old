<p>I've found it quite reliable recently, different to vscode for sure but probably worth trying again and reporting any crashes</p>

<p>I wouldn't say we (if there's a we) are more focused on Lean 4 -- I want both to work equally well until Lean 4 is what everyone uses. Lean 4 has new LSP functionality so there's some cool things that only work on Lean 4, but I personally use it with Lean 3</p>

<p>The only crash related thing I'm aware of is this issue: <a href="https://github.com/Julian/lean.nvim/issues/203">https://github.com/Julian/lean.nvim/issues/203</a> which I believed was macOS only -- if that's what you're running into the crashes would indeed be suuuuuuper annoying. So if it's that (if you see lots of segfaults) let me know, though I'm not sure what to do, it just requires some time digging through the source code.</p>

<p>I've been using it exclusively with Lean 3 for quite a while now (will get back into development as soon as I've PR'ed some of my work on random variables). Haven't run into any major issues yet, but I do get <code>SigAbrt</code>once or twice daily (on Linux) and do <code>:LspRestart</code> when that happens -- but it's something I'm willing to accept so that can use vim...</p>
