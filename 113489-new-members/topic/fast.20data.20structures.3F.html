<p>While trying to clean up this implementation of <code>rewrite_search</code> I am trying to figure out which data structures are the fastest and had a couple questions. I would expect that it's the ones implemented in the VM. It looks like <code>d_array</code> is supposed to be, for example. My first question is, does this work quickly as I'd expect? When I look at the code some of the methods don't seem like they would be efficient. For example from <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/blob/0ec2a19/library/init/data/array/basic.lean#L11">https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/blob/0ec2a19/library/init/data/array/basic.lean#L11</a>:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="sd">/-- `write a i v` sets the `i`th member of `a` to be `v`. Has builtin VM implementation. -/</span>
<span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">write</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">d_array</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">fin</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">v</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">α</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">d_array</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="n">α</span> <span class="o">:=</span>
<span class="o">{</span><span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="bp">λ</span> <span class="n">j</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">h</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="n">j</span> <span class="k">then</span> <span class="n">eq.rec_on</span> <span class="n">h</span> <span class="n">v</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="n">a.read</span> <span class="n">j</span><span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>That implementation looks like it will be O(n) to evaluate a read after doing n writes. Is it actually being replaced with something else more efficient by the VM?</p>
<p>My second question is whether there are other efficient data structures. In particular a good map structure like a hashmap or a treemap would be nice. There are a bunch of different tree-like structures lying around and I was wondering if there's conventional wisdom on which are the best to use.</p>

<p>There is an array-based hashmap implementation in mathlib</p>
