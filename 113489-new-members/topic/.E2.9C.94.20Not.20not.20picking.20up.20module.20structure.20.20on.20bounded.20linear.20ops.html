<p>I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> has suggested this before also. While it should be possible using some of the generalization linter code (assuming it is fixed up a bit first to remove the obvious bugs) as Eric says its not clear a linter is really an effective way of helping new members who keep running into this as they probably aren't used to checking it, it would be nice to be sure that we don't accidentally have this in the library though of course.</p>

<p>Although given Cameron knew to use <code>[non_unital_normed_ring A] </code> and not <code>[non_unital_ring A] [non_unital_normed_ring A]</code> that probably wouldn't  help much - it's easy to make this mistake by accident when combining together typeclasses you need for things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem for me was that star_module doesn't define a module structure and I assumed normed_space was doing something similar.</p>

<p>Yeah, I'm really sorry. This is clearly something we have to work on. If you're an experienced user then you can just look at the definitions and see what <code>extend</code>s what and whether there are <code>old_structure_cmd</code>s involved etc, but this is not something that one can reasonably expect a relative newcomer to do: in maths we just say "let R be an integral domain" or "let M be a module over a C^* algebra with all the obvious assumptions" and it seems to be a lot harder to do this sort of thing in Lean unless someone who knows what they're doing sets everything up first. When I'm teaching Lean the vast majority of the exercises I give the students involve filling in <code>sorry</code>s in proofs, so they don't have to define anything at all themselves.</p>

<p>The fact that <code>star</code> and <code>norm</code> use very different approaches despite having similar names is certainly confusing here</p>
