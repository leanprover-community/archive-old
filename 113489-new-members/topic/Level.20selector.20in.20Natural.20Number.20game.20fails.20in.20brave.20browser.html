<p>I don't exactly know where to report this, as github seems... abandoned?<br>
In Brave browser (but not in chromium) the level selector - that dynamic thingy that moves level circles like they're connected with strings - bugs out and becomes unresponsive. It's impossible to select any levels but a couple.<br>
Lean itself loads okay, works fine (in those levels that are selectable) as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>What can I do? Where should I go? And what additional info should I provide?</p>

<p>My feeling with NNG is that it works so why mess with it. I only wrote the Lean code, we could ping <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="132175">@Mohammad Pedramfar</span> to see if he has anything to say about this...</p>

<p>the 404s are because of the source maps and in general source map errors can be ignored</p>

<p>the two "unrelated" errors basically mean the website attempted to instantiate the WASM module using one mechanism and that mechanism failed and another mechanism was attempted (which was successful)</p>

<p>anyway in my experience the brave browser loves to wreak havoc upon websites, maybe someone who has brave installed could help perhaps</p>

<p>The github isn't abandoned. It's just as Kevin said, there was no reason to change it anymore, it does the job.<br>
I remember there were some issues with Lean in other browsers, so I just wrote "The games built with this library work best in Chrome and Firefox." in the readme file in github. I'm a bit busy at the moment and I'm not really an expert on javascript, so it may take me a while to figure out what's wrong. In the meantime, if you absolutely have to use brave browser, you can just choose the world/level in the url, like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/?world=6&amp;level=1">https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/?world=6&amp;level=1</a></p>
