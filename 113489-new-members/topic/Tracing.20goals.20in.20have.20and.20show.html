<p>I can't see (in either emacs or vs) the goal stack when using have and show. It works well when within begin and end. <br>
When I move to the next lemma, it does not show "no goal". Nor does it show no goal after the lemma. This makes it a bit<br>
harder to learn Lean that it should be. Is this intentional or a bug?</p>

<p>Can you give some screenshots /examples of where your cursor is and what you'd like to see?</p>

<p>I got into the habit of typing <code>, </code> (comma space) after everything to see the no goals after the last line</p>

<p>Can you confirm that you're using the leanprover-community version of Lean rather than the very old official Lean 3.4.2?</p>
