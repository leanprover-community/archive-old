<p>Hey! I'm thinking on trying to formalize geometric group theory, and it seams LEAN is the place to do this. I have pretty much zero knowledge of proof assistants, but I'm trying to learn now. Anyone has done some work in GGT already?</p>

<p>oh hello I'm not a mathematician so I'm afraid I can't answer your question, but I believe it might be helpful to check out our learning resources <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html">https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html</a>, especially the Logical Verification course</p>

<p>I'm not sure logical verification is the best start for someone interested in formalizing math, I suspect it aligns much better with <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="270523">Huỳnh Trần Khanh</span>'s interests than the ones in your message.</p>

<p>I don't think we have anything on geometric group theory. Even the definition of the Cayley graph with respect to some generating set, as a metric space for the word distance, is missing.</p>

<p>There is some difficulty here: should you put in the edges (to get a geodesic space) or just the vertices (then the Cayley graph would be a copy of the group, with the additional data of a distance).</p>

<p>Probably a good place to start is to define quasi-isometries between metric spaces (or extended metric spaces) and prove their basic properties, as it would require less know-how.</p>

<p>Yes, I think starting with quasi-isometries of metric spaces in general is probably the best way to go. I would not make Cayley graphs into a geodesic spaces, but only keep the vertices and the metric itself (as a discrete distance). I think a good test would then be to verify that two different generating sets for your group induce quasi isometric graphs. And then probably try and see if we can show that Ends(G) \in {0,1,2,\infty}.</p>
<p>Then, longer term goals would be the ability to talk about, say, hyperbolicity, growth, and eventually even to prove Stalling's result about ends, and even Gromov result. At first, I thought Gromov's would be "impossible" due to its resilience on stuff like Lie groups, real vector spaces, etc, which I thought were quite far off in terms of formalization. But I see LEAN has quite a large library already, so who knows…</p>

<p>ah, I see Gromov-Hausdorff has been done already: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/topology/metric_space/gromov_hausdorff.lean">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/topology/metric_space/gromov_hausdorff.lean</a></p>

<p>Defining quasi-isometries, putting a distance on the group associated to a finite generating set, and checking that two such distances are quasi-isometric, looks completely reasonable.</p>
<p>Classifying the number of ends is harder, I think (first, one should define the space of ends), but not completely crazy.</p>

<p>As for Gromov theorem (the one on groups with polynomial growth, right?), Kleiner's proof has less prerequisites and would therefore be a better choice for formalization. But this is clearly a long-term goal.</p>

<p>Great, thanks for your input <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110050">@Sebastien Gouezel</span>! This looks like something I will try and pursue then.<br>
Actually, re Gromov's theorem (yes, the polynomial growth one), I had a look at the blog post by Tao and it looks like the proof can be neatly cut into preliminary results which are then relatively easily combined; I think/hope this makes it at least superficially amenable to formalization.</p>

<p>Hi, the graph theory part of mathlib is in the process of a big refactor so formalizing things like Cayley graphs right now is probably not the right time, better wait for a few weeks. I should know because I did it myself some time ago, see <a href="https://github.com/vbeffara/lean/blob/lean-3.4.2/src/graph_theory/cayley.lean">https://github.com/vbeffara/lean/blob/lean-3.4.2/src/graph_theory/cayley.lean</a> (that is the definition of the Cayley graph and the proof of quasi-isometry under change of generator set, using the current simple_graph API, but it is still draftish). But nice to know that there is work happening in that direction :-)</p>

<p>Not quasi-isomorphisms but quasi-isometries, in the sense that on a group equipped with two (finite) generator sets, identity on the group induces a bi-Lipschitz map between the corresponding Cayley graphs.</p>

<p>We're working to make things generic so that there's shared API between many different kinds of graph-like structures. The ETA is Soon (on the order of weeks rather than months).</p>
<p>I'm also hoping that things will look roughly the same for <code>simple_graph</code>, just that lemmas will find some new homes in other namespaces.  I'd say, if you want to get to work on graphs, you should feel free. Just be aware that things might change a bit.</p>

<p>Then you can put a <code>metric_space</code> structure directly on the <code>presented_group rels</code> or the <code>presented_by G p</code></p>
