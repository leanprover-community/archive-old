<p>I have two questions about coercions :</p>
<p>1) Is there a direct way to go from <code>0:nat &lt; 2:nat</code> to <code>0:real &lt; 2:real</code> ?</p>
<p>2) I have a type X,  E is of type <code>set X</code>, and <code>x : \N \to E</code>,  is there a way to see x as a sequence in X rather than in E? <code>\u x</code>does not seem to work.<br>
The context is that I have a defintion of limit in X and I would like to apply it to sequences in E. Of course I can declare <code>x: \N \to X</code> and add the property that every value of x is in E, but I guess coercions are designed to do the job.</p>

<p>Your first question is a bit vague, but maybe it is answered by the following snippet:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">real</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">basic</span>

<span class="kn">example</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">h</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="bp">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">0</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">ℝ</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="bp">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">:=</span>
<span class="k">begin</span>
  <span class="c1">-- exact h   won&#39;t work</span>
  <span class="n">exact_mod_cast</span> <span class="n">h</span><span class="o">,</span>
<span class="kn">end</span>
</pre></div>

<p>I guess this example was oversimplified but, just in case, the "right" way of proving <code>(0 : ℝ) &lt; 2</code> is to use the <code>norm_num</code> tactic.</p>

<p>As for the second question, you might well find that <code>x 3</code> is a pair, consisting of (1) a term of type <code>X</code> and (2) a proof that this term is in <code>E</code>. So perhaps <code>(x 3).1</code> will be the element of <code>X</code> that you're looking for.</p>

<p>To make matters even more confusing (at least for a beginner), if <code>E : set X</code> then <code>E</code> is a term, not a type, and so <code>e : E</code> doesn't really make sense (and neither does <code>\N \to E</code>). However it's OK, because there is something called a subtype of X, and what happens is that when Lean sees you want to think about <code>E</code> as a type it coerces it magically to be the subtype. This is the difference between <code>{x : \N | x &gt; 6}</code> and <code>{x : \N // x &gt; 6}</code> (the first is the subset, the second is the subtype). The coercion is indicated by the little up-arrow <code>\u</code>.</p>
