<p>I'm currently reading <a href="http://is.ifmo.ru/books/_principles_of_model_checking.pdf">Principles of Model Checking</a> and am considering formalizing some of its material.<br>
Does anyone know if there are any model checking related formalizations out there (or in Mathlib) yet?<br>
That is, things like transition systems, state graphs, traces, linear time properties, ...</p>

<p>I have a very bare-bones formalization of LTL and CTL based on that book, you can see <a href="https://github.com/loganrjmurphy/lean-temporal">here</a>.</p>
<p>I know that Simon Hudon gave a talk at LT19 about embedding temporal logics, I believe <a href="https://lean-forward.github.io/lean-together/2019/slides/hudon.pdf">these</a> are the slides. I also think there was some talk about these in the <a class="stream" data-stream-id="236449" href="/#narrow/stream/236449-Program-verification">#Program verification</a>  stream a while ago.</p>
<p>edit : see <a href="http://this">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/236449-Program-verification/topic/Projects/near/215764510</a> </p>
<p>I don't know of anyone who did a more significant formalization of that book's material though.</p>

<p>Another thing I started playing with recently was porting <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/atp/OCaml_v0/index.html">John Harrsion's OCaml code on model checking</a> to Lean 4, although this has been put on the back burner for a while</p>
