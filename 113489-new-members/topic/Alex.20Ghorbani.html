<p>Hi my name is Alex and I am an undergraduate math student with an interest in contributing to the mathlib, specifically adding to the existing code or writing new stuff about symmetric monoidal categories and frobenius algebras. If anyone is working on, planning to work on, or interested in working on something like this, I would love to discuss!</p>

<p>Welcome! If you're interested in monoidal categories there's this project I've been interested in but haven't had the time to work on yet, which is to define and add API for the trace in general rigid categories (see the discussion initiated by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="224323">@Junyan Xu</span> here on May 2: <a href="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Representation.20Theory">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Representation.20Theory</a>, I don't know how to link to the specific message).</p>

<p>I think it's <a href="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Representation.20Theory/near/280956826">this message</a> though I am not an expert; <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> is not very responsive recently, but <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="487500">@Oleksandr Manzyuk</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="438192">@Yuma Mizuno</span> might be able to guide you to some extent.</p>
