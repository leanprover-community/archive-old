<p>When simplifying some bernoulli power series lemmas, I run into a dependency problem.<br>
The pr is <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/6641">#6641</a>. I have file <code>bernoulli_polynomial.lean</code> depending on <code>bernoulli.lean</code>. Some lemmas I moved from <code>bernoulli</code> to <code>bernoulli_polynomial</code>, because the new proof depends on stuff from <code>bernoulli_polynomial</code>. However there are some other lemmas in <code>bernoulli</code>, which depend on the lemmas that I moved to <code>bernoulli_polynomial</code>.  Should I then just move all the stuff that depends on the moved lemmas to <code>bernoulli_polynomial</code>as well or is there a better way of doing it?</p>

<p>Yes, it looks like you'll have to move everything that depends on the moved declarations. If you anticipate that we may add a lot more to <code>bernoulli_polynomial.lean</code>, it may make sense to create a 3rd file specific to Bernoulli power series and stuff that depends on those definitions, and at that point we may want to create a directory <code>number_theory/bernoulli/</code> and rename <code>bernoulli.lean</code> to <code>bernoulli/basic.lean</code>, etc.</p>

<p>I am not an expert here, but is there a reason it's in number theory, anyway?  Many kinds of polynomials get their own file in <code>ring_theory/polynomial</code>, see <code>chebyshev</code>, <code>dickson</code>, <code>symmetric</code>, soon <code>pochhammer</code> and <code>bernstein</code>.  Wouldn't it make sense to put <code>bernoulli</code> there too?</p>

<p>And the power series material could move to <code>ring_theory/power_series</code>.</p>

<p>Certainly Mazur would put them in <code>math/bernoulli</code> <span aria-label="grinning" class="emoji emoji-1f600" role="img" title="grinning">:grinning:</span> <a href="http://people.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/papers/slides.Bartlett.pdf">http://people.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/papers/slides.Bartlett.pdf</a></p>

<p>Thanks for all the hints! When trying to fix this, I noticed that I actually have a circular dependency in the proof, and this won't be resolve shifting stuff around between files.. <br>
I closed the pull request for now.  When trying to simplify it I simply didn't realize that <code>bernoulli'_odd_eq_zero</code> (written by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="250372">@Ashvni Narayanan</span> ) actually uses the power series we were trying to simplify...</p>
