<p>What should I do if I type 'lake intit foo' in vscode and then get the message 'lake: command not found'? A very specific hint please, because I don't understand the rest anyway.</p>

<p>What have you run / followed to install Lean? That would sound like you don't have Lean 4 installed, or if you do, that it's not on your PATH.</p>

<p>Lean 4 seems to be installed. The first examples from 'Theorem proving in Lean' just work. Just making a project is not possible.</p>

<p>Perhaps lake isn't on the PATH picked up by vscode, what if you open up a separate terminal window and try there? Also try <code>elan -v</code> to be sure</p>

<p>elan -v returns the same error (elan: command not found). There is a .elan folder in my home directory. What do I need to do to get it working? Any idea what went wrong with the installation?</p>

<p>Try closing your terminal and opening it again</p>

<p>Jesus. Closing and then opening again works. Apparently it was too obvious. Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>The installation process adds things to your PATH but the current terminal doesn't update.</p>
