<p>If I have some <code>structure my_structure</code> with specific arguments, would the most canonical way of saying that no members of my structure exist be <code>¬ ∃ a : my_structure, true</code>? Or is there more widely accepted syntax</p>

<p>I think <code>X -&gt; false</code> is generally used as the way to say "X has no terms"</p>
