<p>I am playing the natural number game to try and learn about lean, but for some reason, the screen always says "lean is busy... " for all my proofs, even the ones I have previously completed and which ran fine before. I have deleted the code on the level where this problem started, and I have restarted my browser and computer. I was wondering if anyone had any guidance.</p>

<p>It might be a cookie issue? Try a different browser?</p>

<p>I should be clear here -- I have no idea what cookies are but I know that they're relevant in order to make things work. I'm listed as an author but I only wrote the Lean code; I don't know anything about the web interface.</p>

<p>If you open your browser's dev tools console, do you see any suspicious messages?</p>

<p>I tried it on safari and chrome to the same result. It is weird because the game itself is loading, just not when I type in anything myself. Maybe I just have poor connection.</p>

<p>Does the console message say which file was not found? If it's something like <code>favicon.ico</code> then that's normal.</p>

<p>I just visited <a href="https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/">https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/</a> now and after clicking to world 2 I see something like the following in my console. Everything seems to work as expected, so this is the "normal" output:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Text only"><pre><span></span><code> GET https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/favicon.ico [HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found 106ms]

<p>It said these three links: </p>

<p>I have it working in chrome now (I started in Safari) by just reseting my progress and reloading it a bunch of times.</p>

<p>Odd, in Safari I see those same 3 missing files, but the game seems to work for me. Glad you got it working!</p>
