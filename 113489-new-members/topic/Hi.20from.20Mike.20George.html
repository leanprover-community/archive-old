<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm a CS PhD with interests in PL, FV, and various topics in math.  I've made a few small contributions to coq's <code>math-classes</code> library, and I'm just starting to learn lean in my free time.</p>
<p>I'm hoping eventually to write some computational geometry algorithms (e.g. polygon intersection / union), but I think I will start small by implementing a priority queue.  AFAICT these are not currently implemented in mathlib, so maybe this would be a good thing to eventually contribute?  If so, does it make sense for me to make a fork and work there for now?  Also, should I be using lean 3 or lean 4?</p>
<p>Thanks, and looking forward to learning more!</p>

<p>Hi! Probably using Lean 4 will suit you better for more programmy things, its still under development of course and the maths library isn't fully ported yet, but certainly advanced enough for implementing data structures. I just had a quick search and found <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Std.BinomialHeap#doc">docs4#Std.BinomialHeap</a> already, maybe that can be some inspiration or you want to build on top of this instead of starting from scratch.<br>
Generally people contributing to mathlib or mathlib4 or std4 ask the maintainers for push access to the (non-master branches) of that repo rather than using a fork.</p>
