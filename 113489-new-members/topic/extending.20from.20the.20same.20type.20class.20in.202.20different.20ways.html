<p>I've run into the issue </p>
<p>"invalid 'structure' header, field 'class W' from 'class Y' has already been declared." </p>
<p>This is because I want a class Z that extends from both class Y and class X. The issue is, class X and class Y are both extensions of class W. I would like to keep classes X and Y as they are, but I don't know how to handle construction of class Z if I'm not allowed to inherit from class W twice. In other words, the following diagram cannot be constructed:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">class</span> <span class="n">W</span> <span class="c1">-----&gt; class X</span>
  <span class="bp">|</span>                 <span class="bp">|</span>
  <span class="n">v</span>                 <span class="n">v</span>
<span class="n">class</span> <span class="n">Y</span>   <span class="c1">-----&gt; class Z</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>where arrows are extending to a class. Is there a nice way to clean this up? I would rather not have to list out all the hypotheses from either X or Y in the construction of Z, if that is avoidable. Obviously I could do that, but I would much rather keep the structure of Z inheriting from both X and Y, if possible.</p>

<p>By default Lean creates <code>to_W</code> field in <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>. With <code>old_structure_cmd</code> it will duplicate all fields from <code>W</code> in <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> and define a function <code>to_W</code>.</p>

<p><code>set_option old_structure_cmd true</code> seems to have broken some of my proofs. Specifically, when proving a field is a vector space over itself, it now doesn't understand that multiplying two scalars and scaling a vector use the same operation.</p>

<p>Yes. Because a field is a ring, and a ring is a module, the proof is immediate when a vector space is defined as a module over a field (since then a field over a field is also a module over a field). As an exercise, I was defining a vector space directly from its axioms, and proving statements about it.</p>

<p>This <code>old_structure_cmd</code> stuff is just one of several things which is obscure to discover and breaks stuff which "should be obvious". The easiest way to resolve things like this is just literally to post a <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/wiki/Minimum-Working-Example-&#40;MWE&#41;">#mwe</a> and ask "why doesn't this code run?". Experts can fix issues quickly here making it easier for mathematicians to proceed. I know things could be better. We're working on it.</p>
