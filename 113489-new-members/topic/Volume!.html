<p>New member here. Wanted to lurk for a while, see how things are done, learn stuff.</p>
<p>But the volume of posts is quite daunting. Several hundred per day. Wow. Very intimidating!</p>

<p>Bienvenue, Jacques! I don't think you should worry about that too much. Start by trying to formalize things on your own and ask questions when you get stuck.</p>

<p>I guess I should introduce myself too: I'm not new to formalization at all. I'm author of stuff that's in the Agda stdlib, and about 1/2 of the agda-categories library. I'm also co-author of a branch of HOL Light, HOL Light QE, that adds quote and eval to HOL Light.  Before that, and a long time ago, I worked at Maplesoft (makers of Maple) for 11 years. I was head of the Math Group for quite a few of those years, so I'm kind of a symbolic computation expert. And Chair of IFIP WG 2.11 on metaprogramming, so I guess I'm an expert at that too.  But a total novice at Lean.</p>

<p>It's formalization!  I, like everyone else, gets stuck all the time.</p>

<p>Welcome, Jacques! Great to see you here. :-)</p>
<p>The threading on zulip is really nice, so it's usually straightforward to ignore the conversations you don't have time for.</p>

<p>We'd love to hear your impressions, criticisms (or patches and PRs!) on any aspect of Lean or mathlib --- it's incredibly useful to have expert eyes from other theorem provers. (Unsurprisingly you'll find us already too set in our ways in some places, but we want to learn!)</p>

<p>I'm on this zulip and the category theory one, 5 slack channels and 5 on discord too. And then there's email and twitter (PL twitter is amazing). Information overload.</p>

<p>I'm going to soak it all in a bit longer before I jump in and criticize.</p>

<p>If you need pointers to documentation, where to find particular developments, etc. just ask. If you ever want a tour of the categories library, just ping me, as I'd love to hear your take comparing to how things are done in agda (which I don't know at all well).</p>

<p>But I can meta-comment: I'm unlikely to 'criticize' Lean, the system, very much. Though I might point out features of other systems to consider. mathlib, that's a very different kettle of fish!  There, I have actual expertize, and will jump in when I think that my 'contribution' can make an actual difference. [I'm going to try really hard to not criticize when it's tilting at windmills. I do that enough as it is.]</p>

<p>Getting a tour of the category library would be nice. Not right now, but perhaps in the next couple of weeks.</p>

<p>in addition to scott's offer to tour the category theory library, scott has written a wonderful set of exercises to introduce it, available at <code>leanproject get lftcm2020</code>, along with several other great sets of exercises</p>

<p>But I am actively exploring parts of the design space (proof relevance, setoids, purely constructive) that I would not necessarily recommend.</p>

<p>I'm having fun doing it that way, and it turns out to work way better than I had any hope to expect.  When Jason and I started out, we both expected to learn "the hard way" why that part of the design space was a mistake. We learned the opposite: that it's a happy place to be!</p>
