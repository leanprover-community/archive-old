<p>I'm working with multiple big mutually defined inductive types (I'm trying to formalize a language with up to 7 different syntactic sorts). This works okay, but when I try to define corresponding recursive functions, Lean informs me that it has <code>failed to prove recursive application is decreasing, well founded relation</code>. Here is a smaller counterexample:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>inductive N : Type
| Z : N
| S : N -&gt; N

mutual def f1, f2, f3
with f1 : N -&gt; N
| N.Z := N.Z
| (N.S n) := f2 n
with f2 : N -&gt; N
| N.Z := N.Z
| (N.S n) := f3 n
with f3 : N -&gt; N
| N.Z := N.Z
| (N.S n) := f1 n
</pre></div>


<p>From the error message, I see that it tries to do lexicographic ordering, however this obviously fails. Is there a simple workaround? Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>I guess I am in the third case, where I need to define my own well-founded relation. The document suggests</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The easiest way to define a well founded relation is using a function to the natural numbers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This indeed solves the example above, but for my bigger example, the obvious candidate is the size of the term. However, for this I need to define 3+ mutually recursive functions, again causing the error above. What am I missing? I attach the full example. <a href="user_uploads/3121/MQKdjTD4HaM7RsrtQ5-zpE0h/syntax.lean" target="_blank" title="user_uploads/3121/MQKdjTD4HaM7RsrtQ5-zpE0h/syntax.lean">syntax.lean</a></p>

<p>Generally speaking, <code>mutual def</code> is pretty fragile, and things often go wrong. You're usually best off working out how to roll your own mutual definition (e.g. defining first <code>f123 : N \to N \times N \times N</code>, then later defining <code>f1</code>, <code>f2</code>, and <code>f3</code> as projections).</p>

<p>Thank you for the advice, but unfortunately, it does not generalize to my case. I guess the simple example I gave was misleading. What I have are say mutually recursive types <code>T1</code>, <code>T2</code> and <code>T3</code> and I need to define functions <code>size1 : T1 \to N</code>, <code>size2 : T2 \to N</code>, <code>size3 : T3 \to N</code> (as a first step in getting a well-founded relation). I tried avoiding <code>mutual def</code> by defining a single function <code>size : T1 \oplus T2 \oplus T3 \to N</code>, but I get the same error.</p>

<p>Is there a better way of defining this function aside from listing all the possible 8 x 10 x 2 = 160 cases? I guess one can be smart with auxiliary functions, but probably that again leads to the well-foundedness issues?</p>

<p>Sorry, not really. Here is sort-of an example:<br>

Ideally <code>le</code> and <code>lt</code> would be defined mutually, but you can see in that case that they are defined together. A <code>using_well_founded</code> at the end there is in fact required to make things actually work, but this seems about the easiest way forward, for example.</p>

<p>I have played around with it a bit and I would guess that the problem is in the fact that the type <code>A + B + C</code> is actually <code>A + (B + C)</code> (and the same problem probably persists with products?). As such, if you have <code>b : B</code> and <code>cons b : A</code> if you put them in the sum they become  <code>sum.inr (sum.inl b)</code> and <code>sum.inl (cons b)</code>, both having <code>.sizeof</code> (which is the default ordering it tries to use as far as I can tell) of 2 despite <code>b</code> being a subterm of <code>cons b</code>. </p>
<p>Example: </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>mutual inductive A, B, C
with A : Type u
| base : A
| cons : C → A
with B : Type u
| cons : A → B
with C : Type u
| cons : B → C

mutual def adepth, bdepth, cdepth
with adepth : A → ℕ
| A.base := 1
| (A.cons c) := 1 + cdepth c
with bdepth : B → ℕ
| (B.cons a) := 1 + adepth a
with cdepth : C → ℕ
| (C.cons b) := 1 + bdepth b
</pre></div>


<p>The above code complains that it cant prove <code>2 &lt; 2</code> in the case <code>| (A.cons c) := 1 + cdepth c </code>.<br>
This can then be kinda fixed by introducing a new type <code>t(riple)sum</code>.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>inductive tsum
| first : A → tsum
| second : B → tsum
| third : C → tsum

def depth : tsum → ℕ
| (tsum.first A.base) := 1
| (tsum.first (A.cons c)) := 1 + depth (tsum.third c)
| (tsum.second (B.cons a)) := 1 + depth (tsum.first a)
| (tsum.third (C.cons b)) := 1 + depth (tsum.second b)
</pre></div>


<p>and the code seems to work for now.</p>
<p>But could one perhaps construct a better <code>sizeof</code> function for a specific sumtype?<br>
So something like</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>def correct_size :  A+B+C → ℕ
| (sum.inl a) := A.sizeof a
| (sum.inr (sum.inl b)) := B.sizeof b
| (sum.inr (sum.inr c)) := C.sizeof c
</pre></div>


<p>and then use this as the measure? I have failed to find a way to insert this into the <code>using_well_founded</code> even with the help of<br>

<p><code>correct_size</code> is not correct, because you are depending on the sizeof instance of A which is broken (you have to use <code>correct_size</code> to define it, meaning that this function is mutually recursive with a typeclass instance)</p>
