<p>Hi guys, newbie here. I'm trying to prove that: the convergence of a sequence to a limit 'a' is equivalent to its limits supremum and infimum equaling 'a'. I'm stuck because I can't seem to take the minimum value of a set of real numbers (set of upper bounds), which to my knowledge should be entirely possible...?</p>
<p>I've posted this question on mathstackexchange but I'm looking for a more direct answer as to what I'm doing wrong. Link is here: <br>
<a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4544239/using-lean-to-prove-the-convergence-of-a-sequence-is-equivalent-to-the-equality">https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4544239/using-lean-to-prove-the-convergence-of-a-sequence-is-equivalent-to-the-equality</a></p>
<p>I'd really appreciate any tips or pointers as to how to go from here. Also, I can't seem to use Lean after installing it as per the instructions on the website, so I'm using the online web editor - I don't seem to have any mathlib stuff installed in VS and I'm not quite sure how to download them?</p>

<p>No it isn't. This has nothing to do with Lean. What if your set of real numbers is all real numbers?</p>

<p>For a minimum of a set, you want to take the infimum <code>Inf</code>, see <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/order/complete_lattice.html">https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/order/complete_lattice.html</a><br>

<p>Oops sorry if I wasn't clear; I've defined the set to be the set of upper bounds of a bounded function, so there should be a minimum value that acts as a supremum of the function. I was trying to use 'min' to define this</p>

<p>I think the real way to be clear on a forum such as this is to post some code. That way there is no ambiguity left. Take a look at the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mwe.html">#mwe</a> link and then ask your question by posting a sorried theorem which other people can just cut and paste and see on their machines. Otherwise you're just going to get people like me piling in saying things like "if the function is unbounded then the set of upper bounds is empty so has no min" and perhaps derailing the question which you want to ask.</p>

<p>Thanks! Inf seems to give less errors than min (at least I don't have to prove linear order now), but there's a type mismatch from my definition of a bounded sequence and also a placeholder synthesizing issue... I'll read around the link and see if I can spot what i'm missing. </p>
<p>I did follow the youtube instructions to download lean, but I'll try reinstalling and creating a new project again. Thanks for the pointers!</p>

<p>I've posted my small bit of code in the question - really should've done that from the start. Just wanted to say that I enjoyed your YouTube tutorials in the Lean 2020 summer lectures (I've worked through the first few), really learnt a lot quite quickly!</p>

<p>With your code I get an error:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">type</span> <span class="n">mismatch</span> <span class="n">at</span> <span class="n">application</span>

<span class="n">term</span>
  <span class="n">up_bounds</span> <span class="n">b</span>
<span class="n">has</span> <span class="n">type</span>
  <span class="n">b</span> <span class="bp">∈</span> <span class="n">set_bounded_seq</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">set</span> <span class="n">ℝ</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span>
<span class="n">but</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">expected</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="k">have</span> <span class="n">type</span>
  <span class="n">set</span> <span class="bp">?</span><span class="n">m_1</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span> <span class="bp">?</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Is your question how to make the error go away? The error says what the problem with your code is. If you hover over <code>Inf</code> you see</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">has_Inf.Inf</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="bp">Π</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">α</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span> <span class="n">u_9</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">self</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">has_Inf</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">],</span> <span class="n">set</span> <span class="n">α</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">α</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The first input is in <code>{}</code> brackets so Lean will sort it out for you. The second input is in <code>[]</code> brackets so Lean will sort it out for you. The next input is a term of type <code>set α</code>. Conclusion: <code>Inf</code> is expecting to be fed a set. But you feed it <code>up_bounds (b)</code>. If you type <code>#check up_bounds</code> you see this:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">up_bounds</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="bp">Π</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">ℕ</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">ℝ</span><span class="o">),</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="bp">∈</span> <span class="n">set_bounded_seq</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">set</span> <span class="n">ℝ</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>So <code>up_bounds</code> first expects a function (which you give it), and then it expects a proof that this function is bounded and it will output a set. In particular, <code>up_bounds (b)</code> is a function which eats a proof that a set is bounded and returns a set, so it's not a set, and indeed this is exactly what the error says.</p>
