<p><strong>More Context</strong><br>
I want to learn how to write tactics. I have ideas for tactics that could be useful, and it seems like tactic writing is a scarce skill in the community. I've read the tactic writing guide a few times, but a lot of it still goes over my head. I don't have an extensive background in functional programming or type theory. Are there any other resources I should look at? Should I wait until I understand Lean better by writing more proofs? General advice for learning how to write tactics? I've heard a chapter of Mathematics in Lean will cover tactic writing eventually.</p>

<p>There's some more info on tactic writing in the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html#textbooks">Hitchhiker's guide</a>. I can't say what will make you into a tactic writer since I'm not such a person myself, but I've certainly learned a lot from studying the code of various tactics in core Lean and mathlib.</p>

<p>Start reading the source code of tactic implemented in mathlib.</p>

<p>Start telling us (here, for example), ideas for new tactics, and we can tell you "sounds hard"/"ill-specified"/"sounds like a good first project". :-)</p>

<p>Write some simple examples. Write an <code>assumption</code> tactic. Go through the logic solver example in Programming In Lean and fix it up!</p>
