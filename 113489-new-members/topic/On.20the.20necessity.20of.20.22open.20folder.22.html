<p>I have been confused for <em>weeks</em> about why, when I open a Lean file in VS Code, it can't find any of its imports, even though there is a <code>leanpkg.path</code> file in the directory and Lean compiles the file just fine on the command line.</p>
<p>I just figured out, finally, that for some reason, when you "open a file" in VS Code, it invokes lean in some way that apparently prevents it from looking at the <code>leanpkg.path</code> file.  In order for lean to behave normally in VS Code (i.e. the way it does on the command line), you have to first "open folder" and then click on the file you want to open inside the folder display.</p>
<p>This is <em>extremely</em> unintuitive for me.  When I open a file in a text editor, I expect to be able to edit it in the same way regardless of how I happened to open it.  Why does VS Code even have an "open file" option, if it doesn't open the file in a useful way?  What exactly does this command do differently, and what is the use case for when someone would want that?</p>
<p>At least, it would be helpful to have some big red warnings about this in the Lean documentation.  Now that I go back I see that the page on <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html">Lean projects</a> indeed instructs me to use "Open folder"; but it doesn't give any indication that opening a file in this way is different from opening it with "Open file", so I naturally assumed that it didn't matter.</p>

<p>Even though I've been aware that I need to use "open folder" for 4 years, I have no idea what the underlying reason is. I would also like to know the answer to this question.</p>

<p>VSCode has a notion of "workspaces" which are essentially defined by the folder that you open. The server is run from that directory, and it looks for <code>leanpkg.path</code> in that directory and its parents</p>

<p>if you open a random file unrelated to the workspace root, it will not be able to find the root file and won't be able to resolve imports</p>

<p>The reasoning I <em>think</em> at this point is just that no one has tweaked the root dir discovery in the VSCode Lean plugin to work the way you suggest -- in neovim it indeed works the way you mentioned (not sure about lean-mode). I think a PR to fix this for VSCode was welcome last time it was discussed, but I couldn't figure out the right VSCode APIs when I looked and gave up</p>

<p>If I'm reading that code correctly, it just walks up through the parent directories of the workspace root looking for a <code>leanpkg.path</code>, and if it finds one, prompts the user to open that parent directory instead.  I don't know what the workspace root is if I "open a file" directly, but if it's set to something arbitrary like <code>/</code> or <code>$HOME</code>, it's not going to find the correct directory that way.</p>

<p>I think the current behavior is because we have one global lean server per vscode window, and so therefore we need the workspace to agree on a single lean version, by putting <code>leanpkg.toml</code> in the root</p>

<p>Thanks Eric, that makes a lot of sense for why the behavior is the way it is.  In an ideal world, I would have expected that each bare file would have its own lean server, run from the location of that file.  But maybe that's not practical.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to entirely forbid opening bare lean files in VS Code at all?</p>

<p>Yeah that's probably possible, but I don't know enough about the internals. </p>

<p>Each new <em>window</em> does get its own Lean server. Editing a foundational file can be very slow when a leaf file (that depends on it) is open within the same window, due to the server compiling everything in between, so I usually just "duplicate workspace" which will open a new window.</p>

<p>That's a great example of why I don't like the "continuous compilation" design.  It's cute when it's speedy, but when things get slow it is really annoying.</p>

<p>Lean 4 doesn't automatically propagate changes you made to other files to your current file.  You have to manually refresh file dependencies in order to do this.<br>
Lean 4 still does continuous compilation.<br>
I agree that continuous compilation is annoying when it is slow, and I would have liked the Coq-style "step through proof" in certain long proofs. Lean 4 does support caching of intermediate goal states, so the continuous compilation should recompile a lot fewer steps each time.</p>

With Lean 3 you can already select among six options (checking nothing / visible lines / visible lines and above / visible files / open files / project files) in VSCode, but none seems to help with the lagging issue when editing foundational file with a leaf file open. I assume if I select "checking nothing" then nothing will be compiled, but the <a href="#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/VSCode.20regularly.20glitching.2C.20to.20the.20point.20on.20unusability/near/273470651">dependencies are still being resolved</a> after each keystroke? That seems to be the key factor in the lagging problem. Does Lean 4 behave differently in this aspect?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Does that mean Lean 4 will still use the list of open files to determine what to compile, but won't update dependency after each keystroke? Once you make an edit to the foundational file it will just compile up to / including all open files, and when you switch to the leaf file and refresh dependencies then you can immediately used what's compiled in the background?</p>

<p>It's also a useful trick that when working on a proof you can use <code>sorry</code> to prevent Lean from checking the rest of the proof (if there are multiple goals you need <code>repeat {sorry}</code>, and you can also sorry out blocks of codes enclosed by <code>{}</code> using <code>sorry { ... }</code>, when you don't want Lean to recheck a portion of proof you already completed.</p>
