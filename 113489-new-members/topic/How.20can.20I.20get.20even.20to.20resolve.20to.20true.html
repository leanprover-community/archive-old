<p>Thanks. I'm trying to get a sense  of the bridge in Lean from theorem proving to "correct programming", that is, starting with a specification like</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">even</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Prop</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="bp">∃</span> <span class="n">k</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="bp">*</span><span class="n">k</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>and elaborating it into an algorithm.  So the answer is to look at <code>decidable.to_bool</code>.</p>
<p>Since one of the goals of the Lean project is to program Lean in Lean, with the resulting implementation being provably correct in some sense, this transition from specification to algorithm has to happen when you have Lean in Lean.</p>

<p>I will say that writing a verifier that can prove its own implementation correctness is the stated goal of the <a href="https://github.com/digama0/mm0">MM0 project</a>, but it's not lean, that would be way too hard mode</p>

<p>Lean lets you write both algorithms and specifications, and you can have either one without the other, or both together</p>

<p>Developing correct programs by correctly elaborating specifications is a goal.   The link I gave to is to doing that is for  Coq, but Lean is not too far from Coq.   I guess you have to assume the correctness of the verifier, if it is not feasible to verify the verifier in other than an informal sense.   </p>
<p>Certainly it is the case that decision procedures for many sublanguages of logic are intractable.  That doesn't stop people from wanting to try.  For example, Microsoft managers in funding Lean may have this objective in mind.</p>

<p>I think you misunderstand. There is no theoretical difficulty, but both lean and coq are gigantic programs that have had years of effort put into them (without concern for verification). Verifying software is much harder than writing it, especially if it wasn't part of the plan originally. It's an engineering problem.</p>

<p>Of course you can use lean and coq to verify <em>other</em> programs, particularly toy programs, without too much effort; in a sense that's what they are good at</p>

<p>Unverified Lean in Lean would still be nice.  It's a good way to stress-test the whole language design.  You'd have to bootstrap a little from a prior non-pure-Lean version but it should be doable.  For example, Haskell is written in Haskell except for the runtime system: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Haskell_Compiler#Architecture">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Haskell_Compiler#Architecture</a></p>
