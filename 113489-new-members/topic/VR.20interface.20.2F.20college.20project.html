<p>Hello world !<br>
My name is Landry Morel, I am a graduate student at UC-Berkeley and a former maths major at Paris V Descartes. I currently have a project for one of my classes where I have to build a VR game. I have always wanted to create a new medium for doing maths, and handling concepts through gesture and a Man-Machine-Interface rather than chalk and talk really feels like a promising idea. I humbly come to the Lean community for guidance, as I might not be the first with this dream. I am specifically reaching out to teachers/enthusiasts that have tried the current VR offerings for math lessons to give me a baseline understanding of the state of VR maths classrooms.<br>
Thank you !</p>

<p>What does VR mean? You mean headsets? What does this have to do with lean?</p>

<p>I do mean Virtual Reality, with headsets and joysticks. I believe that Lean has a tactics structure that could be built upon (or even power entirely) the game I am trying to build<br>
The endgame is to provide for high-schoolers/college undergraduates with a very intuitive way to engage with their classes while keeping the rigor and methodology needed for academia</p>

<p>Whatever you're planning to implement, I wish you a great luck. And please make it open-source.</p>

<p>Thank you !<br>
I am more inclined than not to make it open-source, if it ends up being usable and not just a tech demo</p>

<p>Yes this is exactly the goal ! Even if it might not be trivial to find ways to represent the most advanced mathematical constructs, I am fairly certain that most of undergrad arithmetic, pre-hilbertian algebra, real/complex analysis and probabilities/statistics could greatly benefit from a gamey interface.</p>
