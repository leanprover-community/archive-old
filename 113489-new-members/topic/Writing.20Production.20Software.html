<p>Hello! New to lean (and zulip). I'm kid of a hobby proover and functional programmer. I also started studying HoTT recently, little by little. Having previous experience with Agda and Haskell, how does Lean compare to them (and maybe Idris) in terms of writing software?</p>
<p>I've found Agda to be quite underwhelming in the area of writing "production" software, but that's to be expected as it is not the focus. Idris is improving, still not at the satisfactory level but getting there. Haskell is what I mostly use.</p>
<p>I've noticed Lean "advertising" as functional programming language which can be used as the theorem prover, but I get the feeling it has more focus on theorem proving. Am I right?</p>
<p>Writing "production" software that is also proven to be correct in the same language seems quite nice appealing to me. How far (or close) is Lean to that ideal?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="426016">@Luka Hadžiegrić</span> welcome. You certainly want to look at Lean 4 (see also the <a class="stream" data-stream-id="270676" href="/#narrow/stream/270676-lean4">#lean4</a> stream here on zulip).</p>

<p>Lean 3 is what most of us use, because Lean 4 is still brand new, and doesn't have a large maths library yet. Lean 3 is very good for theorem proving, but for practical production programming, my understanding is that Lean 4 is several miles ahead of Lean 3 (-;</p>

<p>That's cool, I've just been looking at that. Shame that all the info is still in the relative terms to the Lean itself e.g. Lean4 is faster than Lean3.</p>

<p>There's also Mario's metamath verifier: <a href="#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/Metamath.20verifier.20in.20Lean.204/near/237837021">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/Metamath.20verifier.20in.20Lean.204/near/237837021</a></p>

<p>Yes, this seems impressive. I wonder if there are any web server libraries for Lean already? Seems like they have opened up quit a few possibilities for memory management performance in that arxiv paper.</p>

<p>Not yet. The Lean 4 ecosystem is virtually nonexistent. You can't write production quality software with Lean yet, unfortunately. <del>Theorem proving software is, for the most part, experimental.</del></p>

<p>I agree about the Lean part, but Lean 4 was only released this year. The ecosystem will emerge.</p>

<p>Well, for HTTP you can get away with a homebrew implementation. Because you have to use a reverse proxy to manage more complicated aspects of HTTP anyway, such as TLS, HTTP/2, virtual hosts, etc <span aria-label="joy" class="emoji emoji-1f602" role="img" title="joy">:joy:</span></p>
