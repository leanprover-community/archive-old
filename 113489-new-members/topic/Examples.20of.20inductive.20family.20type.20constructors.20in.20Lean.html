<p>I am trying to develop an intuition of how inductive families type constructors work in lean. I was wondering where I can find more examples of inductive type families in Lean standard library? So far, I've discovered <code>eq</code> and <code>heq</code>.</p>

<p>the most important ones are probably <code>eq</code> and <code>acc</code> (well founded recursion).<br>
there's an introduction to well founded recursion in lean <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/induction_and_recursion.html#well-founded-recursion-and-induction">here</a> and you can find the definition <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/blob/8ae4f717da4d6d4eb0c64f1808aaa9e8890ee0bb/library/init/wf.lean#L11">here</a>. a dependently-typed<br>
<a href="https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/inductive_types.html#inductive-families">vector</a> is also often used as an example (although rarely used in practice), and <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/1f309c52c472a6cd37e41c580a470033e63d4720/src/data/list/perm.lean#L24">inductive predicates</a> come up a lot in general.</p>

<p>Thanks Marc for the pointers. I'll check it out.</p>
