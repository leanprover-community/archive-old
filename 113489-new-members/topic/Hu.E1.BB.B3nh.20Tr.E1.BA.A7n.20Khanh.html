<p>Oh hello world. I've been around for a little while right. This is such an awesome place. Anyway I'm a high school student (grade 12, about to enter college) and I'm interested in computer stuff. I've been writing code since 2014 (when I was in grade 6) and I was interested in formal verification when I was in grade 8. I frantically read about stuff like Coq, HOL Light and whatnot but I wasn't really mathematically mature back then. I had a vague feeling that a proof is equivalent to a computer program but I didn't know that this is called the Curry–Howard correspondence <span aria-label="joy" class="emoji emoji-1f602" role="img" title="joy">:joy:</span> Now I think I'm comfortable with basic math concepts. I hope that I'll become proficient in Lean and formalize things I find interesting.</p>

<p>I'm not formally trained in mathematics so most of the things I say are probably dumb, please don't bite this newcomer LOL</p>
