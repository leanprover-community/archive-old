<p>Hi, I'm Deniz, and it's about time I introduce myself here rather than hiding in the Xena discord. I've just finished my first year of maths at Imperial and I've been experimenting with Lean 4 to use it for my own projects, but also because I want to gain some experience to help out when the mathlib port starts for real.<br>
I've been learning the ropes by porting some things that were part of lean3's prelude. I've PR'd the file on partial and linear orders to the mathlib4 repo and I have a couple larger files on integers I'm cleaning up and will PR as well. As I've said they're mostly for my own learning but they may be useful for people doing more interesting things like algebra and tactics as well :)</p>
