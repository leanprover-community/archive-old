<p>I have a hole where Lean says "don't know how to synthesize placeholder" and lists a bunch of things in the context.  I want to run the equivalent of Coq's <code>simpl</code> tactic in the context and see the result.  (I'd be willing to explicitly name the things I want to unfold if that's better, and, in this case, I'd also be fine with fully normalizing everything).  How do I do this?  (I'm in Lean 4 if it matters.  (I'm not sure whether to ask newbie questions that seem not specific to Lean 4 here or over in the #lean4 channel...))</p>

<p>(I don't know how to answer your question, but I think newbie questions about Lean 4 should probably go in the <a class="stream" data-stream-id="270676" href="/#narrow/stream/270676-lean4">#lean4</a>  stream. For one, I think the Lean 4 developers are only watching that stream and not this one.)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="241007">@Jason Gross</span> The lean analogue of Coq's <code>simpl</code> is <code>simp</code>, and <code>simp</code> doesn't exist yet in lean 4, last I checked, but they are working on it so things might have changed since then</p>
