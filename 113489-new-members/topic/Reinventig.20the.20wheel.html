<p>I find it helpful when learning a new tool, to re-write already existing material, to go through and see how each element interacts, etc. Is there a way to disable lean's library to mitigate name collisions, and/or reliance on already existing code, or does lean become essentially unusable in such a state?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="384455">@capli</span> depends on how far you want to go. You can certainly avoid using mathlib. If you also want to avoid the core library, you should start your files with <code>prelude</code>. And yes, lean will not be very usable. But that seems to be what you want (-;</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> Well, depending on the meaning of "useable", yes. hahaha<br>
Thank you for the tip!</p>

<p>I've done a fair bit of this sort of thing when learning and teaching Lean. For example I <a href="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/complex-number-game">rewrote <code>data.complex.basic</code></a> and here there were no issues -- I just didn't import <code>data.complex.basic</code>. But some students and I <a href="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/group-theory-game">rewrote basic group theory</a> whilst having group theory already imported and here it was more of a pain. We <a href="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/group-theory-game/blob/152ec4a92ad67b6174a3d240c63fa56a6df6017e/src/group/basic.lean#L17">spend our entire time in the <code>mygroup</code> namespace</a> and even then <a href="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/group-theory-game/blob/152ec4a92ad67b6174a3d240c63fa56a6df6017e/src/subgroup/cyclic.lean#L318">things don't always go smoothly</a>, because there are lemmas about groups which live in the root namespace so one inevitably gets collisions; we just made do with writing <code>mygroup.blah</code> now and again, and having <code>mygroup.group</code> open.</p>
