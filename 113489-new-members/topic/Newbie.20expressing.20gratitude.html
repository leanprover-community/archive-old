<p>I know  that the world is not even close to a perfect place to live, but I just want to say that I feel very privileged and grateful to live in a time and place where the opinions and advice of so many intelligent and experienced people are available to me at the press of a few buttons.  Being able to interact with this group is such a benefit to me personally that would not have been possible if countless others throughout history had not struggled and persevered  in much less accommodating circumstances.  I feel like this group is operating in a really good place and time and I am thoroughly enjoying the experience.  I hope some day that I might be able to contribute back something of some small value and that I am not perceived as being a drag in any way.  Best wishes to everyone and happy Leaning to all you math geeks!</p>
