<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I'm trying to find a lemma that says there exists a bijection between a finset and its cardinality. I saw in the library that there exists what I want for fintypes: <code>fintype.equiv_fin T</code> where <code>T</code> is a fintype. But <code>finset.equiv_fin</code> doesn't exist.<br>
Is there something like this for finsets, or is my best bet to use <code>fintype.of_finset</code> to convert it into a fintype and work from there? <br>
I want finsets in particular because I'm working with finite subsets of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="double-struck">N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{N}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68889em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">N</span></span></span></span></span> and I want to take the min/Inf of said sets (which, unluckily, seem to only take in finsets).</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Can you prove a <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mwe.html">#mwe</a> showing what type you want out?</p>

<p><a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/set.finite.fin_embedding">docs#set.finite.fin_embedding</a> is probably close to what you want</p>

<p>An equiv is between types, so you'd have to coerce the finset to a Sort (and the cardinality to a Sort, which would be <code>fin n</code>) to have an equiv. Which is exactly what your thought of <code>fintype.of_finset</code> combined with <code>fintype.equiv_fin</code> would give you.</p>

<p>This was exactly the issue I had while trying to make an mwe for Eric. Still getting used to the whole sets vs types thing. Will try this out...thank you!</p>

<p><code>fintype.equiv_fin (s : set _)</code> may be what you're after, for some finset <code>s</code></p>
