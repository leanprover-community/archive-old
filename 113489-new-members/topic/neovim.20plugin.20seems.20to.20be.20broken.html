<p>Hi</p>
<p>I generated a new project using lake, and tried opening it up using the lean neovim plugin. Sadly, my cursor seems to jump around whenever I move it to the right side of any definition. This does not seem to be an issue after disabling the lean plugin. Anyone has a fix for this?</p>

<p>Update: this only seems to be an issue while the infoview is open</p>
