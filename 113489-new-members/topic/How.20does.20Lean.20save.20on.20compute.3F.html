<p>When I execute a proof that invokes high-level tactics (for example, the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/algebra/group_power/basic.html">power operator</a>) which are constructed from lower-level tactics (like multiplication, addition, succession, etc.), I have a feeling that the code isn't actually accessing or considering all of these lower tiers during runtime. </p>
<p>This makes it fast, right? How does this work? Is there a place I could read a bit more about it?</p>

<p>A tactic is something like <code>induction</code> or <code>rw</code>. Things like multiplication and addition are just regular functions, or terms. Lean is not actually doing any multiplications when you use the multiplication function -- it's meaningless to ask to compute "x * y" anyway, if x and y are random elements of a random ring. Lean's proof checking boils down to checking that a certain term has a certain type, rather than evaluating the term in any way.</p>
