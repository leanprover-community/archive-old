<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> That would be cool. Maybe a way to select an expression could be like in Mathematica, where each time you click, it extends the selection to the next larger complete expression containing it. For example, triple clicking on a parenthesis selects the whole grouping.</p>

<p>In the widgets view it's already pretty easy to select an arbitrary subexpression (just hover on parentheses). All we'd need to add is a <code>conv</code> button on the pop-up, which should then insert into the current tactic block an appropriate conv invocation to zoom to that subexpression.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder if there could be a version of Lean where all you do is manipulate interactively the goal and hypotheses through a GUI.<br>
Right now it feels kinda like using a car but instead of driving it yourself, there is another person driving and you just yell him tactics hoping he does what you want.</p>

<p>I should use VS Code more often, selection seems to work perfectly well enough already!</p>
<p>For <code>congr</code>/<code>skip</code> vs patterns, what are the design constraints? Is the generated tactic code supposed to look pretty? Is it supposed to be somewhat robust to changes in the proof? It seems hard to design for the latter, especially without experience using such a tool, so generating some kind of coordinates into an expression seems like a solid first strategy to me.</p>

<p>You can remove that perhaps. This has been one of Ed's explicit goals from the very beginning, and it's indeed very much needed. The only question is when this will happen and who will do it. Note that widgets are coming to Lean 4 too.</p>

<p>Missing tactics (those which work in regular tactic mode but not conv mode) and being unable to close side-goals created by <code>rw</code> are much more common problems for me.</p>

<p>Would the following tactic idea work or help? Consider <code>look_at n1 n2 n3 ...</code> where <code>n1</code> and so on are natural numbers.  What these do is provide coordinates into an expression to select a subexpression.  The result of the tactic is a new goal <code>subexpr = ?m</code> with a metavariable <code>?m</code>, and the old goal has that subexpression replaced with <code>?m</code>.  When you're done modifying the left-hand side of the new goal, you can <code>refl</code>.</p>

<p>(I'm not sure how <code>conv</code> works internally, but I imagined it's sort of like this. This just exposes it in a way that might let you stay in the usual tactic mode.)</p>

<p>If this were workable, then there can be other ways to select subexpressions, too, like patterns.  It might also be nice if it could be told to select all defeq instances of an expression for simultaneous rewriting -- maybe it could help with certain tricky dependent rewrites?</p>

<p>Maybe also <code>look_at n1 n2 ... with a b c ....</code> could be a way to rewrite under binders, where <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and so on are the names it gives each hypothesis as it auto-<code>intro</code>s its way to the target expression.</p>

<p>A problem with this is that <code>rw</code> is very eager to close a <code>subexpr = ?m</code> goal.  One hack is to tag the right-hand side with something that inhibits this.  Using pre-existing tactics:</p>
