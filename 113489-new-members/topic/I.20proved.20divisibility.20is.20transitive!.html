<p>I was learning number theory before discovering Lean, so it's pretty exciting that I can describe and prove the statement "If a divides b, and b divides c, then a divides c"!</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>variables {a b c: ℤ}

constant divides: ℤ → ℤ → Prop

axiom divides_expand: divides a b → ∃(d: ℤ), a * d = b
axiom divides_conclude: (∃(d: ℤ), a * d = b) → divides a b

theorem divides_trans (hab: divides a b) (hbc: divides b c):
divides a c :=
  have h1: ∃m, a * m = b, from divides_expand hab,
  have h2: ∃n, b * n = c, from divides_expand hbc,
  exists.elim h1 (assume m: ℤ, assume hamb: a * m = b,
    exists.elim h2 (assume n: ℤ, assume hbnc: b * n = c,
      have c = a * (m * n) , from calc
           c = b * n       : hbnc.symm
         ... = (a * m) * n : congr_arg _ hamb.symm
         ... = a * (m * n) : mul_assoc _ _ _,
      have a * (m * n) = c, from this.symm,
      have ∃mn, a * mn = c, from ⟨m * n, this⟩,
      divides_conclude this
  ))

theorem two_divides_four: divides 2 4 :=
  have 2 * 2 = (4: ℤ), from refl _,
  have ∃(d: ℤ), 2 * d = 4, from ⟨2, this⟩,
  divides_conclude this

axiom four_divides_twenty: divides 4 20 -- same as above

theorem two_divides_twenty: divides 2 20 :=
  divides_trans two_divides_four four_divides_twenty
</pre></div>


<p>Still a beginner, so feel free to nitpick or correct the way I'm writing it :)</p>

<p>I guess what is happening here is that I am reflecting the theory in the way I see it -- "if <code>b=d*a</code> and <code>c=e*b</code> and I want to solve <code>c=x*a</code> for <code>x</code> then I'm going to use <code>d*e</code> and then it's just boring calculations".</p>

<p>So I guess my comments would be: like Johan, I agree that you should avoid axioms; you never need them when doing mathematics (we already have plenty). I found <code>∃ (d: ℤ), b = a * d</code> easier to use than ...<code>a * d = b</code> because I could do rewrites without having to use <code>\l</code>. I personally cannot stand all this have have have in the weird mode promoted by TPIL in chapters 2 to 4, I think tactic mode packages it all up in a much more coherent manner. My instinct is to use big tools at all times because then I don't have to think, but I think the only time I used <code>ring</code> I could have used <code>mul_assoc</code> (perhaps my life was easier than yours because I switched the definition of divides?), and both times I used <code>norm_num</code> I could have used <code>refl</code>.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="244890">@agro1986</span> when I started here two years ago <code>ring</code> didn't exist and all these calculations had to be done by hand. My undergraduates found all this <code>rw add_assoc</code> very hard work and then Mario stepped in and wrote it and it was a real game-changer. <a href="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2018/06/13/ab3/" target="_blank" title="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2018/06/13/ab3/">https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2018/06/13/ab3/</a> . Since then Rob Lewis wrote <code>linarith</code> which was another game changer -- we were doing basic undergraduate analysis in Lean and the tactic made a whole bunch of inequality-chasing on the real numbers much easier.</p>

<p>Tactics are wonderful since you can inspect the tactic state, but they can make things less transparent since they are often used as a black box. I think it's not an issue in this specific case, but I could imagine that in some instances, a proof using high-powered tactics like <code>ring</code> and <code>norm_num</code> for elementary facts could end up depending on the proof of the same fact (or something stronger) somewhere else in mathlib. I once lost points in a representation theory course for appealing to Jordan-Hölder without proving it myself; I sort of see this as roughly analogous.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> Thanks for the natural number game link! Will check it out. Great point about <code>b = a * d</code> easier to use than <code>a * d = b</code>. Actually <code>a * d = b</code> is the written form straight out of my number theory textbook haha. Gotta start thinking more about subtle things like that.</p>

<p>The state of my meta knowledge means that every tactic is a black box. (Much like Jordan-Hölder was, in fact <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span>)</p>

<p>yeah, don't trust mathematicians, they somehow think that <code>a*d=b</code> and <code>b=a*d</code> are the same.</p>

<p>If you want to call these black boxes then fair enough, but my feeling is that if a new 1st year maths undergraduate asserted either of these claims to a lecturer here and claimed they were true, the lecturer would not ask for a proof -- the techniques used are in both cases "standard". So I would rather call applications of these tactics "enabling mathematicians to do mathematics the way they expect to be able to do it" rather than elevating what is going on to the level of "black box". Of course you see from that blog post that there's a heck of a lot going on with the <code>ring</code> example! But because the answer is "obvious" we mathematicians shouldn't need to care about what's going on.</p>

<p>Yes, I think we're mostly in agreement. I guess I would feel more comfortable if I knew how to inspect all the "dependencies" of a theorem.</p>

<p>The red boxes are because Zulip is relying on pygments for syntax highlighting and that's out of date. I think there were discussions right around when I joined about fixing it but I guess they never went anywhere.</p>

<p>Oh -- in the norm_num case they are also reflecting the fact that computer scientists care about runtime. We mathematicians all know the proof is just <code>rfl</code> because we know it will work and we don't care how long it will take.</p>

<p>Right, my point is just that there is potentially an issue here for new people trying to prove simple things.</p>
