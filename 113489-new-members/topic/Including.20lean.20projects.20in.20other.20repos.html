<p>I have a GitHub repo that I share with some collaborators. I have recently formalized some of our work in Lean, and I would like to check the Lean sources into our shared repo. However, since <code>leanproject new</code> creates its own git repository, git won't let me add the directory. Will it work if I simply delete the git info in my project? I understand git submodules are a thing, but from what I have read, that doesn't seem to be what I want. For example, I would much prefer that updates to my Lean project resulted in updates to the larger repo (since there are no dependencies). </p>
<p>I would appreciate any advice for how to manage this.</p>

<p>Your Lean work functions as you'd like already?</p>

<p>As far as Git is concerned, there is no issue. I don't know any part of leanproject that requires the files to sit directly in there, so I think you should be good to go.</p>

<p>If so you don't need to use <code>leanproject new</code>, you can just put it in its current form into the repo -- if you already have a <code>.git</code> folder in it and you're willing to get rid of its commit history you can yeah get rid of it</p>

<p>Fantastic. That's what I was hoping to hear. The Lean files are currently stable, and I don't care about the commit history. I got thrown off by something I read saying that a Lean project always has a git repo as part of it. I was worried it would cause problems with the Lean.</p>

<p>Perhaps that sentence should be completed with "has a git repo as part of it, unless you know what you're doing." :)</p>
