<p>Hello everyone, <br>
I'm new to zulip and lean so please point out any of my misunderstandings. I'm working on the level 9 in the inequality world and here is what I have to prove.<br>
"For all naturals a and b, either a≤b or b≤a."<br>
I know how to prove it mathematically but I don't know how to express it in lean. My "strategy" is using the fact that <br>
(a or b) is equivalent to ((not a) then b)  </p>
<p>So here is what I've tried:<br>
by_cases a≤b,<br>
by_cases ∃ (c : mynat), b = a + c,<br>
and in both cases it complains that a proposition I entered is undecidable<br>
Also I think I can't use something like have h := a≤b, because then I have to prove that h is true and it's an impossible goal.<br>
So being desperate I tried to prove a this lemma "(a or b) is equivalent to ((not a) then b)" with "theorem" "begin" and all these commands, but I think I can't do that in the web lean environment.</p>
<p>Please don't tell me that there is this easy way to do this level if I do this that and the other. I want to prove it my way and would really appreciate some help on lean syntax and how to translate my ideas into code or resources that might help me.<br>
Thanks,</p>

<p>You can rewrite using <code>le_iff_exists_add</code> first and then do cases on that, rather than doing <code>by_cases</code>.</p>

<p>In more recent versions of Lean, <code>by_cases</code> doesn't complain about undecidable propositions anymore. If you want to simulate it, you can start your proof with the <code>classical</code> tactic, which isn't introduced by the NNG, but it's still present there.</p>

<p>Note that you don't need classical logic to solve this level.</p>

<p>(Just to clarify my <code>classical</code> suggestion -- that's just a workaround to be able to use <code>by_cases</code> for something that should be decidable anyway.)</p>
