<p>For my program verification proof, I'm currently dealing with many simple tautologies that only involve the equality and subset predicate, unions, intersections, and the empty set (for finset). However, these tautologies turned out to be ugly to prove with lean. After I struggled to library_search my way to close the goals, I figured I could just transform all my subset relations to implications and simplify everything to make it a propositional problem. <code>finish</code> was then able to close the goal. However, <code>finish</code> is quite slow in my case and the *_iff rewrites are also not super beautiful. Are there any recommendations on how to tackle such tautologies? Is there even a specialized tactic?</p>
<p>This is the set-part factored out of my lemma. Do you have ideas to improve this proof? Why is finish so slow here? Thanks ;)</p>

<p>I can quite believe that for <code>finset</code> they're harder though, because fewer "obvious" things are definitional.</p>

<p>Oh, thanks! You used some tactics I didn't know yet, thanks for demonstrating them here! It is nice that you can prove stuff in lean without knowing much but then can improve your repertoire of techniques progressively. May I ask how long it took you to write that proof? Would you be able to write that proof without lean's info view?</p>

<p>I would definitely not be able to do anything without some editor such as emacs or VS Code but I did not use the infoview. The proof took me a couple of minutes to write but I looked at your proof to see the maths argument and then just rewrote it the way I would have written the maths argument.</p>

<p>Ah, I see. But still impressive to come up with that in a couple of minutes! From my understanding, the "advanced" infoview currently does not offer that much over the classic infoview, or am I missing something? I neither used the advanced type display yet, except when hovering on identifiers in VS Code. But the term selection feature is handy to see the associativity.</p>

<p>The widget infoview doesn't offer much over the classic infoview in this setting for sure. There are times when it's really helpful though. Sometimes in my work I have to deal with goals where I've lost track of the types of various terms in the goal and then the widgets are a game-changer. Re: a couple of minutes. I didn't have to look up any of the names of the lemmas I used because these are all well-known to me now. I knew how to rewrite under binders; I also knew the maths proof and indeed I was just refactoring your code. I wasn't immediately sure how to deal with <code>disjoint l1 l2</code> to prove <code>false</code> but the first thing I tried (treating it as [x in things] -&gt; false) worked.</p>

<p>Oh, I checked the history and you're right! Originally, the infoview panel title was always "Lean Messages", and in February I changed it so that it was either "Lean Messages" or "Lean Goal" depending on whether it was displaying all server messages or just the tactic state + messages at the cursor. Then when Ed rewrote the infoview to use widgets in July, the title became "Lean Infoview". I wonder what the Lean 4 extension writers will settle on...</p>
