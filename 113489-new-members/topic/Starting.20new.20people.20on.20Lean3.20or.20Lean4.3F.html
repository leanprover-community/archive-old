<p>Hi folks!<br>
I haven't been actively engaged in the community since the summer, so I'm a bit out of the know. Some folks here in the math department at Ohio State are interested in forming a lean learning/working group. Would it be worthwhile to try to start new learners out on Lean4 or should we stick to Lean3 until Lean4 is more stable?<br>
Thanks!</p>

<p>Daniel, Lean 4 is not yet ready for mathematicians but you can safely start learning Lean 3 and switching to Lean 4 will be much easier than learning Lean in the first place.</p>

<p>I noticed it, yes. I was just stating my opinion.</p>
<p>In the (hopefully not very distant) future, Lean 4 should be better for both mathematicians and computer scientists.</p>
<p>I don't have this opinion because I like Lean 4 better, not at all! I have been using only Lean 3 so far. I have not written a single line in Lean 4 yet. Nevertheless, I think that, for (a group of) new people, jumping right in Lean 4 will be a better use of their time (even though they cannot do as much math with Lean 4 as they could do with Lean 3 now).</p>
<p>I will soon have to switch to Lean 4 in order to keep up with the new development. I don't expect the switch to be easy.</p>

<p>I think someone should decide and announce whether adding more code to mathlib3 is desirable</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I made a similar request on this zulip a few days ago here : <a href="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/No.20more.20PRs.3F">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/No.20more.20PRs.3F</a> (resurrecting a thread from a month back). The verdict seemed to be that PR's to mathlib3 which add substantial new mathematics are still being accepted, as long as they reasonably self-contained changes and definitely don't touch files which are already ported.</p>

<p>Yes, I always check whether a file has already been ported.</p>

<p>Having read now what Kevin Buzzard wrote, I will not add any more PR into mathlib3.</p>

<p>(You might want to read that thread to the end, rather than just reading the quote from Kevin at the start of it; Kevin's quote doesn't necessarily represent the community consensus.)</p>

<p>Speaking purely for myself - I don't think there's a need to stop contributing new mathematics to mathlib 3 at this point, it's just what sounds like a flat out refusal to also assist with the port that rubs me the wrong way. I hope I'm just misunderstanding what people are saying, though</p>

<p>Unpopular opinion: I don't think that the only way how to be a good Lean user is to be helping with a port to Lean 4.</p>

<p>It's not an unpopular opinion. Experimenting with the system in various ways is good for its development. We can find a wider range of bugs if we don't narrow our interactions with it</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="467358">@Daniel Packer</span> sorry that your question got derailed. If you want to do maths then use lean 3 or wait for the maths library to be ported to lean 4 which won't happen until at least the summer</p>
