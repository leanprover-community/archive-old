<p>Hello, I am interested in contributing to Lean. I have a PhD in economics/game theory and BS in math, and have also published in computational complexity and theoretical physics. I have worked through the games, tutorials, and books, and thought I would contribute to mathlib, for instance, on rational functions (see my post under "Is there code for").</p>
