<p>I have basically two weeks of exposure to Dependent Type Theory, and I think of the mathematical world in terms of sets.  I feel like I am east of Eden.   So, to build my intuition, I would like to understand how the natural numbers are defined/constructed at level appropriate for an honors undergraduate student.  Something like how Tao constructs the natural numbers using the Peano axioms in his <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/books/analysis-i/">undergraduate analysis book</a>. Are there any resources any where I can read such a treatment?  Is there a different structure, perhaps a group. that would be appropriate to understand first? </p>
<p>I appreciate any ideas.   Thanks.</p>

<p>Yeah I was looking at that.  It mentions a paper "Peter Dybjer. Inductive families. Formal Asp. Comput., 6(4):440–465, 1994".  I will try to read that.  <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/">#tpil</a> also mentions that </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is remarkable that it is possible to construct a substantial edifice of mathematics based on nothing more than the type universes, Pi types, and inductive types; everything else follows from those.</p>

<p>I would be very much interested to read an accounting of that.</p>

<p>You might also find <a href="https://proofassistants.stackexchange.com/a/1664/122">my answer to this stack exchange question useful</a>.  The main point is that when Lean processes inductive types like the<code>nat</code> it adds a new theorem (axiom?) to the global context called <code>rec</code> which is a super powered version of induction and recursion.  It does all the work.  Lean also automatically derives a bunch of theorems from <code>rec</code>.  And even some of the built in syntax in Lean for working with inductive structures (like match blocks)  is just syntactic sugar for  <code>rec</code>-derived functions.</p>

<p>This is explained in <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/">#tpil</a>, but if you want a deeper dive into DTT, I recommend the first chapter of the HoTT book (<a href="https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/">https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/</a>).  They have a whole section on the  natural numbers and how to derive it’s properties from <code>rec</code>.</p>

<p>into Lean, under the hood four new objects are created in the system. The first object is a new type called <code>nat</code>, which is introduced as an undefined constant. In other words, we can now talk about a new type called <code>nat</code>. The second and third objects are two new constructors for <code>nat</code> called <code>nat.zero</code> and <code>nat.succ</code>. This means that Lean now knows there's a term <code>nat.zero : nat</code> and a function <code>nat.succ : nat -&gt; nat</code>. The fourth thing is a function which can be interpreted as both the principle of mathematical induction and the principle of mathematical recursion. The reason you can do both things with one function is that the <code>Type</code> universe and the <code>Prop</code> universe are both universes and so you can talk about functions taking values in a random universe and this covers both cases. Once you have recursion and induction you can prove all the other obvious things like zero isn't succ of anything, that succ is injective and so on. I wrote something about induction and inductive types <a href="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2021/04/03/induction-and-inductive-types/">here</a>, which might help (I also came to this as a mathematician with some understanding of set theory but 0 knowledge of type theory).</p>

<p>I'm a bit confused.  Are you saying some declaration keyword (like <code>rec</code> or <code>recursor</code>) is used to make declarations in Lean by users?  If so, I have no idea what the syntax is or why a user would want to use this.  Do you have documentation on this feature?  (And I assume we are talking about something separate from <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/theorem_proving_in_lean4/blob/master/induction_and_recursion.md#local-recursive-declarations">local recursive declarations</a>, right?)</p>

<p>In that case is it just a rename of the Lean 3 <code>eliminator</code> designation?</p>

</code></pre></div>
<p>(Not that I understand completely what the <code>eliminator</code> designation provides in Lean 3.  I guess<code>nat.rec</code> can't be a <code>definition</code>/<code>theorem</code> since there is no body/proof, and it shouldn't be an <code>axiom</code> as it shouldn't show up in the list of axioms.   So that necessitates some other designation.  Maybe <code>eliminator</code> also provides special judgmental equalities, or triggers the automatic creation of auxiliary theorems like <code>nat.rec_on</code>.  It also likely makes the bookkeeping easier, especially when checking proofs in the kernel.)</p>
