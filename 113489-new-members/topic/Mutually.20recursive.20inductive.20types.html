<p>Hi all, <br>
I'm trying to use Lean to do some language design and experimentation.</p>
<p>I'm just starting with an untyped lambda calculus which looks a little like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">constants</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">real</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span><span class="o">)</span>

</pre></div>


<p>Unfortunately,  <code>MyList : list myexpr → primval</code> doesn't have <code>myexpr</code> in scope -- I guess lean doesn't hoist definitions?</p>
<p>How would you go about doing this? Alternatively, is a resource on writing embedded DSLs in lean?</p>
<p>Oh, also, where is <code>real</code>?</p>

<p>In this case, though, the path of least resistance is most likely to "inline" <code>primval</code> into <code>myexpr</code>, given that you use it only once</p>

<p>Not long ago, I asked <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110043">@Gabriel Ebner</span>  a question about some mutual inductives and his answer was something along the lines of, "don't ever use them, they don't work".

<p>(At a high level, the situation is: the Lean <em>kernel</em> does not support mutually inductive types; so either you have to use <code>mutual</code> or manage the translation yourself, each with its own downsides)</p>

<p>Every attempt I've made to use them has worked at first, and them quickly led to despair (usually the definitional equations not being usable for some reason), and me asking the experts here "how do I write this without mutual inductives"?</p>
