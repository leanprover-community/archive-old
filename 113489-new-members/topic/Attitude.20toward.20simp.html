<p>In <a href="#narrow/stream/217875-Is-there-code-for-X.3F/topic/.60max_eq_max'.60">a recent thread</a> there was a question about proving the equality of <code>max</code> and <code>max'</code>. I suggested <code>by rw [finset.max', with_bot.coe_unbot]</code> and this worked, but only after the user updated their mathlib to master. It turns out that <code>max'</code> was changed to use <code>unbot</code> only <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/commit/646028a0b749eabb281682751d09fe573a4f8cf6">a few days ago</a>; previously it used <code>option.get</code>, so the solution would have worked with <code>option.coe_get</code> instead of <code>with_bot.coe_unbot</code>.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that <code>with_bot.coe_unbot</code> and <code>option.coe_get</code> are both simp lemmas, meaning that if I had initially suggested <code>by simp [finset.max']</code> it would (in theory) have worked without the user needing to update mathlib. Of course, maybe it's a good thing that they updated mathlib, but my point here is that using <code>simp</code> appears to make code more robust against changes to mathlib, as it chooses the appropriate lemma dynamically instead of relying on a specific one. This benefit of using <code>simp</code> hadn't occurred to me before.</p>
<p>Should I have suggested <code>by simp [finset.max']</code> instead of <code>by rw [finset.max', with_bot.coe_unbot]</code>? More generally, does this robustness mean we should prefer using <code>simp</code> (in our own code and in suggestions to others) even when it only performs one additional rewrite?</p>

<p>My opinion on <code>simp</code> is that if you need to specify any additional lemmas, you're most likely using it wrong</p>

<p>I guess I can try to elaborate: if you have to use additional lemmas on a <code>simp</code>, one of two things is likely happening</p>
<ul>
<li>the lemma should be marked <code>simp</code> but isn't, that's an easy fix</li>
<li>you're doing some rewrites then finishing a proof by <code>simp</code>, in which case I believe it's cleaner to separate the steps out</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, that additional lemma might be a local hypothesis, or there might be the rare case where that hypothesis appears multiple times in the expression and allows for further simplification: using <code>simp</code> with extra hypotheses is fine in that case</p>

<p>It's a very useful tactic but it's hard to understand if you don't already have a clear understanding of what the lemmas it can use are</p>

<p>I was the "user" that Matt refers to!  <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span> </p>
<p>My attitude towards <code>simp</code> is somewhat the opposite of what Violeta said: once I realize that a proof can end with <code>simp</code>, I then try to absorb as many lines before it as possible into the <code>simp</code>.</p>
<p>I find that this makes code much less brittle, precisely for the reason that Matt mentions: <code>simp</code> will try snake its way around lemmas, and if it needs some hints, then I'll make its life easier!</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is probably a question of whether you want to do small fixes every time you change a lemma that is used in a <code>rw</code>, or whether you prefer to do them only when a <code>simp [stuff]</code> no longer works.  The second issue feels its like much less frequent, though it could be harder to fix than the former.</p>

<p>Adding lemmas to a <code>simp</code> is actually a very sane thing to do. This usually happens when the simplification of an expression, except for one or two steps that "complicate" it.</p>

<p>One could also argue that this makes the proofs more readable since it basically says 'simplify and use these nontrivial facts' and it is way easier to understand than <code>simp only [..], rw complicated_lemma, simp</code>.</p>

<p>What do y'all think of this: "You should understand your Lean code so well that tactics are something you <em>want</em> to use, but not something you <em>need</em> to use"</p>

<p>I'm not so sure about that statement, particularly the word "understand". In my experience, after a while you just build up intuition for what tactics will make progress. And concerning simp, I personally found that I used simp more and more with more experience. After a while you realize just how powerful simp can be, and you want to use it as much as possible.</p>

<p>I am a little worried about excessive <code>simp</code> and using "backwards" <code>simp</code> and I wonder if there might be something clearer to write.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="466727">@Jim Fowler</span> Often, when you end up with a huge pile of <code>simp</code>s like this, it's a sign that you've unfolded too much. A few lemmas there stand out as being too "low level" for what you're trying to do: <code>pi.smul_apply</code>, all the <code>finset</code> stuff, ...</p>
<p>Here's a more direct proof. I started the same way you did, <code>squeeze_simp at ha ⊢</code>, then noticed I could rewrite with <code>ha</code> and the proof fell out from there.</p>
