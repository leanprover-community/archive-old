<p>I would like to write some number theory and/or additive combinatorics in lean, mostly to acclimate myself with using a theorem prover. Would anyone be interested to join me? I am open specific topics. Ideally, I would like someone who has some experience with theorem provers, as my experience is limited to the natural number game and the 9 exercise sets from the lean tutorials.</p>

<p>Welcome! I don't really know this part of maths. But it seems like Cauchy-Davenport is a fundamental result, and I don't think that has been formalized in Lean. How hard is the proof mathswise?</p>

<p>Probably <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="246273">@Bhavik Mehta</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="387244">@Yaël Dillies</span> are good people to talk to.</p>

<p>Welcome! You might also like to talk to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="458865">@Thomas Bloom</span> who I think may have a very similar mathematical background to you and a little bit of experience too</p>

<p>Hi George! Indeed, I was just speaking to Bhavik a few days ago about formalising more additive combinatorics in Lean. (Bhavik has already formalised Solymosi's 5/4 sum-product exponent for sets of reals.)</p>
<p>One quite attainable project is to formalise a proof of a Freiman inverse result for subsets of F_p^n. The main steps here would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruzsa Triangle Inequality</li>
<li>Petridis' proof of Plunnecke inequality</li>
<li>Ruzsa covering lemma</li>
<li>A couple of elementary facts about vector spaces, that hopefully are already in Lean somewhere anyway.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think probably formalising a proof of the Ruzsa Triangle inequality would be both very useful, and also a not-too-difficult exercise in learning how to use Lean beyond the tutorials you mentioned.</p>

<p>Thank you all for the extremely quick and friendly responses! </p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span>  Cauchy Davenport is quite easy to prove, I even covered it in an undergraduate course.</p>

<p>(And if you want to see an example of analytic number theory being done 'live' in Lean, Bhavik and I are currently working through formalising my recent paper on unit fractions, see <a href="https://b-mehta.github.io/unit-fractions/blueprint/index.html">https://b-mehta.github.io/unit-fractions/blueprint/index.html</a>. This is an expanded 'blueprint' for reference when writing the Lean proofs, and if you hover over a Theorem's statement you should see a 'LEAN' thing appear for many of them, and clicking that will take you to the relevant piece of Lean code, where it's written.)</p>

<p>Bahvik and I also formalized Szemerédi's regularity lemma and Roth's summer last summer and are somewhat planning on formalizing Szemerédi's theorem this summer.</p>

<p>I also formalised Behrend's lower bound on sets with no 3APs, and Yaël and I proved the little-o version of Roth's theorem using the regularity lemma, so you have some idea of what else is achievable; a couple of years ago <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01449">the solution to the cap-set problem was also formalised</a></p>
