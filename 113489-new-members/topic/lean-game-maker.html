<p>I am trying to use the lean game maker to make a local version of the real number game. I think I downloaded everything correctly and when I make the game it seems to work. However, when everything finishes and I try to run the html file nothing pops up in the browser. I've tried a few things but at this point I am pretty stuck. Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do?</p>

<p>I haven't managed to get the html to work like that. If you add it to a github repo and then create the github page using those files then it does generate the correct website.</p>

<p>What files do I need to upload to github to generate the website?</p>

<p>If you run <code>make-lean-game</code> it will create a bunch of files in some folder (or make a folder called html). I just upload all of that into a repo and then point the github pages at that and it seems to work.</p>

<p>Sorry for all the questions but what do you mean by saying point the github pages at the folder? I got the folder into github but I'm not sure what to do with it.</p>

<p>No problem! So if you go to <code>settings</code> and look at the <code>pages</code> tab then you can select a branch and then select between <code>root</code> or <code>docs</code> folder (I don't know how to get github to look for things in subfolders) . But if you have all the files in the main branch, say, then select this branch and then the <code>root</code> folder. It should then generate the pages for you from this.  </p>
<p>If it helps you can look at what the mirror for the NNG looks like here: <a href="https://github.com/CBirkbeck/natural_number_game">https://github.com/CBirkbeck/natural_number_game</a>. If your repo looks like this then the above should work.</p>

<p>I got it working but now it says that lean is busy and it will never go away. Does anyone have any suggestions on what to do about this?</p>

<p>Allow cookies (some people couldn't play NNG because they had some browser paranoid settings on)</p>

<p>I was able to run the NNG just fine but now that I'm trying this out it just says lean is busy. I turned on cookies anyway but it doesn't seem to have helped.</p>

<p>I had that problem, but for me it was because <code>make-lean-game</code> wasn't creating the mathlib olean files.</p>

<p>The game is built on a lean project right? So maybe the same way you would do for lean projects?<br>

<p>For me the issue was that when I ran <code>make-lean-game</code> I had an error saying <code>Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'leanpkg'</code>. It turned out that I just had a bad installation of the game maker, which once I installed properly, got rid of the error and then generated the correct files.</p>

<p>Interesting, it doesn't seem like anything is working for me. It's not necessarily a big deal but it is a bit annoying.</p>

<p>I figured out that it's only certain levels that aren't working but at least some of it is good.</p>

<p>Are you on Windows? The latest update (KB5014697) introduced some network-related bugs, maybe it's that.</p>

<p>No I'm on mac. For whatever reason everything seems to work now. I didn't really do anything but now it works.</p>
