<p>I've started going through the Software Foundations book series and I've got some observations and one question:</p>
<p>First of all, it seems very much like Lean was written for mathematicians whereas Coq was written for software verification. Even though their core calculi are virtually indistinguishable (modulo explicit vs. implicit universe levels, but I'm not sure how much it matters in practice), the proofs have a very different feel to them.</p>
<p>When proving things in Lean, it feels like most of the time you're hunting for the appropriate lemma to make progress (much like a normal math proof), in Coq it seems like you tend to do a lot more computationally, relying on the specific definition of a function and then letting beta-reductions do a lot of progress.</p>
<p>This leads to very asymmetrical and somewhat "unmathematical" feeling proof. E.g. with my mathematician's hat on, <code>[] ++ l</code> and <code>l ++ []</code> should both be <code>l</code> reasoning that <code>[]</code> is the neutral element of list concatenation. Whereas computationally, one of them is trivial and one of them hard, requiring a proof by induction. In Coq you might prove that a number is a prime by defining a function <code>is_prime : nat -&gt; bool</code>, perhaps have a lemma <code>forall n, is_prime = true &lt;-&gt; prime n</code> and then the "proof" would be "show <code>is_prime 101 = true</code> by reflexivity". </p>
<p>Furthermore Coq's very strong stance to rely much more heavily on constructive logic and computation for proofs makes the systems feel so incredibly different in practice.</p>
<p>Now for my questions; how are Lean's and Coq's <code>unfold</code> related? It seems to me that in Coq unfold literally unfolds a definition, whereas in Lean that's often not supported. E.g. if you define a function by cases (equation compiler, presumably), it won't let you unfold at all until you've already set up the preconditions such that you match a particular case at which point unfold behaves more like Coq's <code>simpl</code> (Lean's <code>simp</code> is a completely different beast applying all kinds of fancy lemma and transformations, much more complex than Coq's <code>simpl</code>.)</p>
<p>Do we have any basic <code>unfold</code> that can unfold definition of pattern matching? And do we have something to do beta reduction as a tactic?</p>

<p>I'm not familiar with Coq's tactics, but if you want to literally just unfold a definition in Lean I think that's what <code>delta</code> does.</p>

<p>While we could do something similar, it's not trivial in lean to obtain the equivalent of <code>unfold</code> on a coq <code>Fixpoint</code> definition, because lean doesn't have a <code>fix</code> combinator like coq</p>

<p>I think what you wrote is literally false but of course it comes from something very real. First I don't think that Lean was written specifically for mathematicians. This would have been emphasized in the early papers and presentation you can find on the official website. Everything I see mention both kinds of applications. And I don't think there is much technical difference that explain what you see, although my understanding is that Coq is better at reflexivity heavy lifting. I think that what you describe is mostly a difference between user communities and libraries. It is well known that mathcomp <em>loves</em> definitional equality, and I guess Software Foundation also does. And of course they are deeply indoctrinated into constructivism, although this is slowly changing. But Coq itself is perfectly capable of being classical. In principle someone could go and write mathlib in Coq and it would feel Lean-like.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> I find the choices Leo made quite interesting, to be honest. Z3 is after all heavily used in software verification in some pretty advanced projects. F* for instance is heavily automatised and it lets you prove whole invariants about programs very easily, often by merely stating them. Lean compared to that is very manual. Yet, Leo frames it at least in some earlier presentations as a next step up from Z3 to make software verification more scalable and robust.</p>
<p>Maybe it's that TPIL and Logic and Proof are specifically written with a math background whereas Software Foundations are written with a software verification background.</p>
<p>I was not asserting btw. that Lean and Coq are technically very different, but that the user experience, syntax choices, etc. give it a very different feel to it. And those things very much influence what can be done in a programming language in practice. As an analogy, even though to a first approximations all programming languages are equal  in the sense that they are turing complete, assembly can be used for very, very different things than, say Java. Which in turn attracts a different community and reinforces the differences.</p>
<p>For instance this fixpoint operator vs recursors / equation compiler difference feels like something, we wouldn't care about unless we are trying to characterise the technical differences between the systems, yet it shows up naturally after trying to do case analysis on a piece of code that uses pattern matching.</p>
<p>Also interesting is the choice to separate computable from non-computable parts in Lean. So you may have a function which has computational meaning and prove a sophisticated property about it in a highly non-constructive way and Lean is quite happy with that.</p>
<p>It certainly feels valuable to experience theorem proving from both worlds as it helps building perspective ;-)</p>

<p>the advantage of lean's approach is that you can't really tell how the recursive function is implemented, and indeed this is taken advantage of so that lean can support multiple compilation strategies depending on how the recursive calls look</p>

<p>the advantage of lean's approach is that you can't really tell how the recursive function is implemented, and indeed this is taken advantage of so that lean can support multiple compilation strategies depending on how the recursive calls look</p>

<p>This is in it's own right makes constructive reasoning harder, though. Precisely because you don't know the implementation details.</p>
