<p>Sorry, I'm going to make a bunch of threads because I have some questions haha<br>
I'm thinking of working through this text in lean <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Real-Analysis-Constructive-Mark-Bridger/dp/0471792306">https://smile.amazon.com/Real-Analysis-Constructive-Mark-Bridger/dp/0471792306</a> , would that be a good choice?</p>

<p>This probably isn't the best book to use if your main interest is in learning how real analysis is conventionally done, just because the approach taken in this book isn't what's normally taught.  But after skimming through the preview that's available on Google Books I think you could learn a lot by formalising this in Lean.  In Chapter 1 the author goes very slowly step by step through the process of defining "intervals of rational numbers", proving properties of them, and picking out special families of these intervals that will play the role of real numbers.  The fact that he's working constructively might actually be helpful to you, since it may be easier for you to imitate the same constructions and definitions in your formalisation.</p>

<p>If you do decide to follow this path I'd suggest you start by working through the definitions and exercises in Chapter 0 (some of which will be repeating things you've already done in the game).</p>

<p>Then when you come to formalise Chapter 1 you'll learn lots about how to define structures in Lean, how to define operations that take these objects as inputs and outputs (for example, the addition function on rational intervals in Definition 1.1.8), and how to use typeclasses to talk about properties of your structures (for example, to assert that there's an interval that plays the role of "zero").</p>

<p>And of course if it does turn out to be horribly frustrating as others have warned then you can always give it up and turn to another book instead, or just study real analysis in a more conventional way.  But I think it's worth the experiment.</p>

<p>There's no such thing as "the right way" to do mathematics, of course. And there is a big difference between learning about the concept of proof, and what constitutes one (a necessary first step in advanced mathematics), and learning specific proofs and proof techniques.</p>

<p>My experience has been that the more fluent I become in Lean, the easier it gets to learn mathematics with it.

<p>The problem with "here is the definition of an equivalence relation, let me show you right now what it looks like in Lean, let's do some simple examples all in Lean, isn't this cool" is that the students who would usually struggle with the concepts when taught in the usual way are likely to be struggling even more when presented with the added obfuscation of a theorem prover. This was one of the things we learnt after experimenting. Better to teach it in a regular way and then give an optional class where you do it in lean <em>afterwards</em>.</p>

<p>Just as a little remark: I think I have written more proofs in Lean and Isabelle than informally by hand so far, mostly because in my math courses we rather rarely get to see a proof or even develop one ourselves, and while I feel like being exposed to theorem provers rather early on (I first did a little bit of stuff with Isabelle close to the end of my 1st semester) did definitely give me a better understanding of the logic and reasoning part I don't at all feel competent enough to write proofs about the things we do in our math courses in Lean vs doing them informally on paper. Although that might also be because as mentioned above my math courses don't tend to stick to the entire proof stuff as much after all.</p>
<p>Just my 5 cents on the usefulness of ITPs in teaching^^</p>

<p>Note that what Kevin’s experience suggests is that you shouldn’t try to teach a whole class via Lean because the struggling students will struggle more. It doesn’t tell us that you <em>as an individual student</em> shouldn’t use Lean as part of your studying. You may well find, as others in this thread have reported, that the extra rigour of using Lean improves your understanding — for example, by preventing you from skimming over things you only half understand and then getting stuck later.</p>

<p>In contrast with Kevin's (new) opinion, I found a thesis that suggests that students should learn formal proving in Coq first, and only then proceed to usual mathematical proofs. It is intended as plan for CS students, but nevertheless, it could be interesting to compare with opinions of various people here.</p>

<p>Theorem provers are used in many computer science departments. The problem we're trying to solve is getting them used more commonly in mathematics departments, where the curriculum is very different so the problems faced also seem to be different.</p>

<p>They might be used on many CS department, but they are usually not used for the first contact between undergrads and mathematical proofs.</p>

<p>In this aspect, I found your teaching methods (as you described them in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp-mQ3HxgDE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp-mQ3HxgDE</a> in 2019) really revolutionary. Not because it was taught to Math students (as opposed to CS students) but because it was taught at the very beginning of their studies.</p>

<p>Maybe this thread can be split and moved to <a class="stream" data-stream-id="187764" href="/#narrow/stream/187764-Lean-for-teaching">#Lean for teaching</a> (and probably merged into Martin's thread?)</p>
