<p>I first installed lean about half a year ago and then didn't come back to it for a while until today. When I did, the lean infoview page in VScode just got stuck on "Waiting for Lean server to start...". To try and fix it, I did my best to uninstall lean and elan and then start again from the instructions here: <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/quickstart.html">https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/quickstart.html</a>. After many attempts, I'm still getting the same issue. Any tips for how to start again more cleanly?</p>

<p>I don't know that much about the installation of Lean 4, but are you sure you want it instead of Lean 3?</p>

<p>Fair point. Just tried with lean3 and it's now giving me an error "Server has stopped with error code 1."</p>
