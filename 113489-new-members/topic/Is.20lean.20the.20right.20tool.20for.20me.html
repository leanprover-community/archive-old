<p>Thank you for your excellent tutorial (The Natural Number Game). I'm a programmer, not a mathematician, and in the search for the right hypothesis checking system, I was only able to gain a foothold here, because all the others were written by mathematicians for mathematicians. However, before I delve into the subject further, I would like to know whether it is really the right tool for me. My work is not about testing mathematical theorems, but rather determining various hyphoteses about certain series of numbers, for example on {1,5,2,8,7 ..}, whether and how often n(x) is even if n(x-1)-n(x-2) &gt; 3. Is it possible with Lean? If not, can you recommend the right tool for me?</p>

<p>wrong, other theorem provers are not written by <em>proper</em> mathematicians for <em>proper</em> mathematicians. they are written by descendants of Zermelo, Fraenkel, Dedekind, Russell, Gödel and the like. from what I've gathered, most mathematicians don't really care about foundations. interactive theorem provers are written by experts that are really familiar with arcane foundational stuff. and you have to adopt a different mental model to use interactive theorem provers effectively.</p>

<p>well... I don't get what you mean. this is pretty vague, can you explain?</p>

<p>I thought my example would be the explanation, but I might try this: the tutorial is based on the set of natural numbers, sorted - and I have to do with rows of numbers that represent certain observations (time series) and have to be validated on various hypotheses from specialist departments</p>

<p>Lean can certainly handle that. But so can any other proof assistant.</p>

<p>It sounds like what you want is not a proof assistant at all, but rather a computer algebra system like Sage or Mathematica. Unless you are interested in proving your conjectures once you have them, the proof assistant isn't that much of a value add. CAS's are much better for experimental mathematics.</p>
