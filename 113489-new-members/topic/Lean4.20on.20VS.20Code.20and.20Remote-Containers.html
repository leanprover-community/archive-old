<p>Hi everyone</p>
<p>I would like to use a Docker image to work on Lean4 together with the Remote-Containers extension of VS Code.</p>
<p>However, everything I have tried so far proved ineffective. One main problem that I have is that the lean4 extension does not seem to work well inside a container development environment.</p>
<p>Has anyone managed to do it? If so, could you please show me how? (Like sharing a Dockerfile or a devcontainer directory).</p>
<p>Thank you all in advance!</p>

<p>What's the issue you're facing with the extension in the container?</p>
