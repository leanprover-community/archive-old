<p>Doing <code>Theorem Proving in Lean</code> section <code>2.1 Simple Type Theory</code><br>
For<br>
<code>#check b1 || b2</code> result:  <code>b1 || b2 : bool</code></p>
<p>Then using <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html">Mathlib naming conventions</a><br>
saw that <code>\or</code> could be used</p>
<p>However for<br>
<code>#check b1 ∨ b2</code> result: <code>↥b1 ∨ ↥b2 : Prop</code></p>
<p>Can someone explain the difference? Thanks.</p>

<p>Thanks.<br>
If you mean do I understand they are different types then yes.  </p>
<p>My path to Lean is via years of programming and not as a mathematician,  so my thinking is that I have two bool types and that the only operators for bool types are the standard ones like <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, etc.  But here the <code>\or</code> is not like those operators so my guess is, a function, that takes in two bool types and returns a prop type. Also, what does the upward pointing errors before <code>b1</code> and <code>b2</code> mean?</p>

<p><code>bool</code> is an inductive datatype. <code>bool.rec</code> is computable. <code>Prop</code> is equivalent to <code>Sort 0</code>. <code>Prop</code> is not an inductive datatype. Classical <code>Prop</code> has exactly two distinct members: <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.

<p>The upward pointing arrow is a <em>coercion</em>, and in that case it's a coercion to Sort, where the said Sort is <code>Sort 0</code>, aka <code>Prop</code>.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="366057">@Eric Taucher</span> Every expression in Lean lives in one of three "levels" -- it's either a universe, a type-which-is-not-a-universe, or a term-which-is-not-a-type. For simplicity, let me just call them universes, types and terms. Examples: <code>Type</code> is a universe, <code>bool</code> is a type (in universe <code>Type</code>), <code>tt</code> is a term (of type <code>bool</code>). <code>Prop</code> is a universe, <code>2+2=4</code> is a type (in universe <code>Prop</code>), and a proof of 2+2=4 is a term (of type <code>2+2=4</code>). Both <code>bool</code> and <code>Prop</code> express the "same kind of idea", however they are at different levels in this hierarchy. There are types <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>(in universe Prop), but these are types, not terms. <code>||</code> is a function which takes two terms, <code>∨</code> is a function which takes two types. The weird up-arrow you're seeing is a coercion which lifts terms of type <code>bool</code> to types in universe Prop, it sends <code>tt</code> to <code>true</code> and <code>ff</code> to <code>false</code>. The two concepts have to be distinguished in Lean because they are different levels in the universe/type/term hierarchy.</p>

<p>The reason we have <code>Prop</code> as well as <code>bool</code> is that <code>Prop</code> is crucial to mathematics, or more generally crucial for reasoning. I write more about this point of view <a href="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2020/06/20/mathematics-in-type-theory/">here</a> but you might not find this helpful because it might be too math-focused. Hopefully I cover the main points above though.</p>

<p>De Bruijn used the word "degrees" for the three "levels" that Kevin is talking about. I'm not sure anyone still uses that terminology, but I think it's nice because Lean also has a system of universe levels, which is orthogonal to the universe/type/term system.</p>

<p>Yes, in all the papers I looked at they seemed to use degree in the same way (automath to lean translation: 1=universe, 2=type, 3=term).</p>
<p>That paper, however, seems to have an exception to this in its description of AUT-4.  To preserve a property called "type reduction" when there are universal quantifications, they make <code>Prop</code> be degree 2, individual propositions be degree 3, and proofs be a new degree 4.  They justify this, saying that it's a natural way to incorporate "irrelevance of proofs" by having it occur only for things of degree 4.  With this system, <code>Prop</code> and <code>bool</code> would be of the same degree.</p>

<p>As far as I understand, universes and kinds are basically the same thing, but experts probably see some sort of distinction (type universes might be more restrictive than the concept of kinds, I'm not sure).</p>

<p>I don't know if this is right, but after skimming through that  chapter it may be worth noting that Lean's universes are somewhat more stratified than what you find in Benjamin Pierce's book, in that universes form a hierarchy. So that we don't just have one atomic kind called <code>*</code> from which you can build other "higher-kinded types" (if that's the right name) like <code>* -&gt; *</code>, but we have an infinite hierarchy <code>Type 0 : Type 1 : Type 2 : ...</code> and so on. So things like <code>Type 0 -&gt; Type 1</code> or <code>Type 2 -&gt; Type 0</code> are different types, instead of just being <code>* -&gt; *</code>.</p>

<p>And in Lean it's not really the case that the expressions are divided into those classes. Rather, everything is one class, everything is a term. It's just that some terms are allowed to appear on the right of the <code>:</code> in a typing judgement, and those terms are said to be types (or at least that's my mental picture of it).</p>

<p>Thanks for the replies.<br>
Does Lean have formal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_rule">type rules</a>? <br>
My curiosity is up and want to compare them to the books.</p>
