<p>Hi there, I am just making an introductory post. I am a student at University of Toronto doing a computer science and mathematics major, is anyone else from there?</p>
<p>I maintain a wiki page where I store things that I have proven (usually typeset in latex), but I wanted to try out proving things with this. </p>
<p>I am completely new to how this works, but I was looking in the library itself and found this: <a href="/user_uploads/3121/APIfSk0vej6Wp-Pgx6BnJ4iV/image.png">image.png</a>  </p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/3121/APIfSk0vej6Wp-Pgx6BnJ4iV/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/3121/APIfSk0vej6Wp-Pgx6BnJ4iV/image.png"></a></div><p>I was wondering where I can read the proof for these theorems.</p>
<p>Also If I prove something in real life, on pen and paper, could I put it into the library? I guess what is acceptable to go in or not. </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>You can click on "source" on the right, and you'll see a bunch of code which Lean interprets as a proof.</p>

<p>Anyways, I'll do the tutorials, and see if I can eventually understand that</p>
<p>Just one last quesiton, I proved this a couple days ago, is this somthing that I could put into it? It's more like a question, but just wanted your opinion:</p>
<p><a href="http://keepaskingwhy.com/mediawiki/index.php/How_many_times">http://keepaskingwhy.com/mediawiki/index.php/How_many_times</a></p>
<p>What would this end up looking like in the language (just a description would be fine, would I be using other people's proofs inside of my proof? Or would it be from scratch?)</p>

<p>I don't have anything to say about your proof you linked, but you should definitely try to work through as much of <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/">TPIL</a> as you can (if you haven't done so). Some of the stuff in the lemma you posted is specific to mathlib (as opposed to core Lean), and beyond the scope of that book, but it will give you most of what you need to start exploring mathlib. It's definitely a learning process!</p>

<p>Mathlib tends not to have "random" recreational maths problems in. There are some International Maths Olympiad solutions in, but they're not in <code>src</code> where all the e.g. undergrad/MSc maths is. At the minute one of the main focuses is on theory-building, trying to get mathlib into a state where it can at least understand the statements of the main theorems in a generic pure math UG class.</p>

<p>On the other hand, people make random repos with their solutions to problems, so I could totally imagine you formalising this in Lean and putting it up on github as a repository which has mathlib as a dependency.</p>

<p>That makes sense. Is there any interest in creating a more singular source for these "off-hand" type math problems. That one is actually useful because it's the number of iterations of a while loop of the form</p>

<p>Oh yeah, another question, is it possible to generate a readable proof (like a proof you would see in a textbook, so it's readable who don't know lean) from a proof in lean?</p>

<p>I would imagine that every person who was interested in "off-hand" problems would be interested in different problems. There was quite a long debate about whether we should be putting IMO problems into mathlib, and currently they're there but in a directory of their own. These questions are complicated from a maintenance point of view. Mathlib is not backwards compatible and the maintainers can easily merge ten PR's in a day, some of which can break stuff. Feel free to make your own repo though, this is one way that people learn.</p>

<p>The easiest way to generate a readable proof is of course to learn the language and then you can just read the proof :-) Right now, the easiest way to make a proof human-readable is simply to write what you're doing in comments in your code. There are tools which can then e.g. turn it into a web page like this <a href="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/docs/lean/sandwich.html">http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/docs/lean/sandwich.html</a> or a game like this <a href="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/">http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/</a> .</p>

<p>For the sandwich theorem, if you click on a line in the proof you'll see the gobble-de-gook code, but then if you click on a grey rectangle you will be able to see the state Lean's brain at that point, which is often much easier to understand if you have a mathematical background.</p>

<p>If you really want to show a particular Lean proof to non-Lean users, you can do some a pretty wide range of things by extending Lean's parser, so that things which Lean can interpret can be made to look pretty similar to something a mathematician can read.</p>
