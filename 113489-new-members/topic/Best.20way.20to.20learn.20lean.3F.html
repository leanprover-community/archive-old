<p>Is <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html">Learning Lean</a> up to date?  I've read through TPiL and even done most of the exercises, but I feel my knowledge is still pretty shaky and I need more practice.  I'm a software engineer but studied foundations of math as an undergrad 30+ years ago.  I hope to contribute to mathlib, maybe starting with <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/wiki/Undergrad-low-hanging-fruits#single-variable-real-analysis">single variable real analysis</a> since I'm familiar with that.</p>
<p>Should I do the tutorials?  I vaguely remember hearing of some Lean challenges on a website, was it leetcode?  Any other suggestions?</p>

<p>one thing that I think everyone here agrees upon is that a great way to learn Lean is to just keep proving stuff and asking questions on Zulip when you get stuck</p>

<p>another thing that I found personally useful was to find interesting lemmas in mathlib and read the source to see how they were proved</p>

<p>Single variables real analysis is in my opinion a highly nontrivial topic in Lean due to the fact that we try to do everything as abstractly as possible. On the other hand most of the theorems are there already (some versions of l'Hospital and Taylor's theorem are missing). I wonder whether it would make a first good project to write documentation for how to do single variable calculus in mathlib? <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="260507">@Heather Macbeth</span> what are your thoughts on that?</p>

<p>Haven't looked through the entire tutorial yet but I can say that I am often slowed down in tactic proofs with jumping through the hoops, i.e. massaging, proofs with the algebra steps.  Looking forward to seeing if this will help speed that part up for me.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="380294">@Matt Diamond</span>  I agree that proving stuff is the best way to learn, the question is, what do I prove?  I need something that's neither too easy nor too hard.  :)   Also, your tip about reading lemmas reminds me of how I learned programming in the first place, before I even had a computer at home.  From reading the listings in <a href="https://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/showpage.php?page=cover">BASIC computer games.</a>  Ah the memories.</p>

<p>That is true, but it still misses a lot of stuff. I guess my dream would be a Analysis 1 book where all fancy theorems just refer to the mathlib version and the examples are worked out from that. Part of the problem in my opinion with finding things in mathlib for newcomers is that they cannot possibly know the abstractions we use. Who would guess that "Cauchy implies convergent" is in <code>topology/uniform_space</code> - who even knows what a uniform space is.<br>
One good project might be to work out some examples of sequences, i.e., take a book on Analysis 1 and try to do the exercises/examples. My guess is that the most annoying things there are the coercions, finding the theorems, and explicit calculations.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="348963">@Martin C. Martin</span> True, there's a sweet spot for good practice proofs that can be hard to figure out. As I've been learning Lean, I've tried to think of mathematical objects / statements that are relatively simple but still capture my interest in some way. For example, I figured out how to define Beth cardinals and proved some stuff about them (this was before they were added to mathlib); I also wrote up a proof that sets in Lean are infinite iff they're Dedekind-infinite. Not exactly difficult stuff, but enough to get me reading through the mathlib docs and trying different things.</p>

<p>I think MiL is currently written by a small number of people with a lot of Lean experience and a very clear vision of what they want to do with this book/project. So it isn't a large-collaborative-project like mathlib. Which is fine, of course.<br>
We just need to lock those people in a room for 2 weeks and fight their universities if they try to put other load on them.</p>

<p>You're right, that's what I originally entered. <code>elan -V</code> outputs <code>elan 1.4.1 (6a7f30d8e 2022-04-15)</code>. I'm running Debian testing.</p>

<p>Try <code>elan self update</code> to see if we can get you up to 1.4.2, and see if that fixes the problem.</p>

<p>Ah, good! I thought it might depend on whether you installed elan with <code>apt install elan</code> or <code>curl ... | sh</code>, but I can see <code>elan self update</code> installing the newer version locally even if it was installed with apt.</p>

<p>It worked smoothly! Thank you very much.<br>
... So, the bottom line is (?) that different projects might depend on different versions of <code>elan</code>.</p>

<p>No, a single elan is fine for all projects, it's just that all pre-1.4.2 versions of elan are broken (in that they fail to download Lean binaries) due to a GitHub change</p>

<p>Talking about GitHub, I created a project of my own, for learning (through <code>leanproject new</code>). Am I supposed to treat the folder as a regular <code>git</code> directory? Like, can I do <code>git commit</code> and <code>git push</code> as usual? Or should I use another tool to manage version control?</p>

<p>yes, it's a regular git repo</p>
