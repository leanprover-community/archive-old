<p>What's the difference between the leanprover and leanprover-community github organizations? Are they both "standard"/"official" organizations? Do they use the same "version" of lean or is there something different?</p>

<p>The leanprover organization is run by Microsoft Research that developed Lean 3 and currently works on Lean 4. The leanprover-community works on mathlib and maintains a fork of Lean 3. I'd say both are "official" organizations in their respective subject area.</p>
