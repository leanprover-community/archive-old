<p>Hello! I was formalising a proof of completeness and soundness of classical propositional logic and i managed succesfuly (did that as a bachelor thesis). I wanted to ask, whether it has some actual value, can be used somewhere or something? I kind of suppose its nothing complicated (maybe it was even done before?), but still. I also would be very thankful- since i am fairly bad with lean and not at all sure with what i created- if someone would be up for scanning through the code to give me some feedback. Its approximately 800 lines long.  Cheers, Jachym</p>

<p>Congrats on completing your project!<br>
I don't know anything about logic, but I'm sure it doesn't hurt if you paste a link to your code here.</p>

<p>Thank you :) <br>
True, I will upload it and paste the link here.</p>

<p>It has been done before in other systems -- see e.g. <a href="https://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/types17.pdf">https://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/types17.pdf</a> . It's always interesting to have these proofs in Lean.</p>

<p>Sooo... i wasnt sure how to share it, so i tried to put it up on github. Here is the link (i hope it works, i dont have much experience with github). Any feedback will be much appreciated!</p>
