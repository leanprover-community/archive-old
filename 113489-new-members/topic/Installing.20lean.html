<p>Dear Colleagues, I am really sorry for asking such a stupid question... So I installed lean using elan and it basically works. But some features do not. For example it does not recognize the words "obtain" "take" and "premise". Surprisingly, if I type "obtain" in VCS, it gets blue while "take" and "premise" do not. Again, I am really sorry for such stupid a question but I was trying to resolve it for two days and to no avail.</p>

<p>These keywords are from Lean 2. They've been gone for 3+ years. What documentation are you following that taught you those?</p>

<p>In short, the active community here uses a fork of Lean 3, which is actively maintained and updated; the links coming from Microsoft and the official Lean pages are all frozen and out of date because they are working on Lean 4, which still doesn't have a release.</p>

<p>The "upstream" Lean 3.x is unmaintained (together with its documentation). There is a community fork with community docs but upstream website doesn't redirect users to the community website.</p>

<p>Hello! I'm required to following this tutorial on lean <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/logic_and_proof/propositional_logic_in_lean.html#expressions-for-propositions-and-proofs">https://leanprover.github.io/logic_and_proof/propositional_logic_in_lean.html#expressions-for-propositions-and-proofs</a> and I'm trying to install lean on vscode but it shows an error "expected command" no matter what I type. I followed the installation instructions on leans github and installed the lean and lean4 extensions on vscode. Anyone know why this is happening? Am I installing the wrong version?</p>

<p>I could be wrong but I believe that tutorial is for Lean 3, not Lean 4... which version of Lean did you install?</p>

<p>Its probably best to disable the extension that isn't corresponding to the lean version you are trying to use, too.</p>

<p>hi, thanks for the reply! I installed both the lean and lean4 vscode extensions as well as all the requirements from the installation guide and when I tried disabling the lean4 extension like Alex has suggested, the lean server was not able to start for some reason. It's giving me this error: </p>

<p>it's likely that you installed Lean 3 along with the Lean4 VSCode extension, which is why the VSCode extension is complaining about getting a Lean 3 request</p>

<p>if you want to go with Lean 3, you'll need to uninstall the Lean 4 extension and install the Lean 3 one</p>
<p>alternatively, you could uninstall Lean 3 and install Lean 4</p>

<p>I'm not so sure about this. The Lean 3 and Lean 4 extensions used to not play well with each other but I seem to have them both installed on this computer and things are fine. Michael, do you have Lean 3 installed on your computer following the instructions here <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html">https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html</a> ? And have you got a Lean 3 project open in VS Code?</p>

<p>Yeah I have them both installed as well but I figured out that the problem wasn't the wrong version but it's because I did not create a lean3 project correctly and I managed to get it working after following the instructions to create a project. Thank you so much to everyone that helped!</p>
