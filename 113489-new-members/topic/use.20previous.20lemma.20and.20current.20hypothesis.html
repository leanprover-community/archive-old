<p>Suppose I have already proved  lemma23: \all x (p -&gt; q)    for some complicated p and q containing x,<br>
and in my current proof state I have h:p[x:= t],    so I would like to have Lean generate for me   <br>
have h3: q[x:t] := lemma23 x h <br>
without me having to type out q[x:=t],  I just want to say,  "use lemma23 on h" and have<br>
the new hypothesis appear.  <br>
Is there any way to do that?</p>

<p>If I understand what you're asking, type ascriptions are usually optional, so <code>have h3 := lemma23 x h</code> should work as well.</p>

<p>Oh!  Well,  that was easy!   Thanks.</p>
