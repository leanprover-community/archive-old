<p>Hello,<br>
I'm attempting to install VS Code correctly. I have made it down the installation instructions (<a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/windows.html">https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/windows.html</a>) to as far as "install leanprover extension" to VS Code, and I am now attempting to select Bash as the default shell.<br>
I hit Ctrl-Shift-p, which brought up the palette, I typed "select default", which showed "Terminal: Select Default Shell" as the only available option. When I clicked it, it states that the only two available shells are Command Prompt and Windows PowerShell.</p>
<p>My Bash is installed into a non-default location. Is that an issue?<br>
I turned the External: Windows Exec path to the path of git-bash.exe . I then entered a test file and typed #lean 1+1 and it threw an error: "command expected  Lean [1, 1]"<br>
Anyone know where I'm going wrong?</p>

<p><code>#lean 1+1</code> isn't a command. How about <code>#check 1+1</code>?</p>

<p>Hmm. True. I thought that the first time, I actually put in "#eval 1+1" per the help file, but just mistyped, but it's working now, either way.</p>

<p>PS I am not at all sure that changing the default shell is an essential part of the installation process; I would be tempted to just not worry. <code>#check 1+1</code> will tell you that it's a natural number, <code>#eval 1+1</code> will tell you which one it is.</p>

<p>Now it has an "Info" problem: "2  Lean [1, 1]" . The 2 (line number?) is white, the rest is gray. This probably doesn't matter, since I'm getting the right answer. Thank you! Off to do the Natural Number Game.</p>

<p>That's what it's supposed to look like</p>

<p>The <code>2</code> is the result, the <code>Lean</code> is some extra info that vscode displays about the source of the hover text</p>
