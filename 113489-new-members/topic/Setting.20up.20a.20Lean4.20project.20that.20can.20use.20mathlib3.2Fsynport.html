<p>(I'm not sure if this topic belongs in "new members" or "mathlib4".)</p>
<p>I'd like to import mathlib3 files for use in Lean4 (I don't need the source), but I'm not sure what my actual options are for practically doing this.</p>
<p>My understanding is that <code>mathport</code>/<code>synport</code> allows Lean3 binaries to be used in Lean4. But does this require maintaining a local copy of the entirety of mathlib3-after-<code>synport</code>ing? If so, how much space does that take up?</p>
<p>The page for mathport mentions an alternative involving a lake dependency, but I don't quite understand the nitty-gritty of setting this up even after reading the README for lake (or what doing so would actually achieve, or even what being an "artifact" really means).</p>
<p>If the size is prohibitive, is it possible to use VS code with remote repositories somehow to only download the binaries needed for a given project, instead of storing everything locally?</p>
<p>I realize these questions are kind of scattered, and might be XY-problem-esque. Overall, though, any guidance or templates that help with the details of setting up a Lean 4 project that can use mathlib3 would be great! Thanks in advance!</p>
