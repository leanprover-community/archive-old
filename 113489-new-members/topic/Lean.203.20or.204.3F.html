<p>Hello, for simple hobbyist type uses, should I be using version 3 or 4? Thanks</p>

<p>what do you want to be doing? we'll soon be migrating mathlib to lean4 and most development going forwards, but not yet. lean4 is a far better programming language than lean3, though</p>

<p>I'm going through "seven sketches in compositionality" with a reading group, thought it would be cool if we did some of the exercises in there in something like lean. So i am not wanting to have like a complete library with everything already implemented, but rather we'd do that ourselves as a learning tool. I think like basic sets and arithmetic would be enough for libraries(?)</p>

<p>I'd suggest using Lean 3 for this.  It's nice having mathlib on hand for those things you don't want to reimplement from scratch.  There are also  more Lean 3 learning resources at the moment.</p>
<p>If you haven't already, I'd also suggest going through some tutorials to get your feet wet before diving into formalizing things from a book.  Seven Sketches in Compositionality is fairly formal, but I think there will still be many technical challenges that will be difficult to overcome without some Lean experience.</p>

<p>Great, thank you for the advice. Yes I'll definitely try to go through some tutorials first.</p>

<p>lean 4</p>

<p>Right now the question is the same as "do you want access to a gigantic mathematics library?". Note that there is <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4">mathlib4</a> which is quite like a "hobby" project now, it's being used as an experimental manual port, and basic stuff like sets are there by now, but it's of course nothing compared to mathlib := mathlib3</p>
