<p>I tried to install it on a Mac and gave up. It will be even more difficult on Windows. <br>
Installing <code>pyenv</code> is advised, but that line <code>sudo apt ...</code> is about installing all the dependencies for python.<br>
I think one of the best bets is to install Anaconda, which puts just about everything on Windows and gives you an environment (currently it comes with python 3.7.6 I think).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="224572">@ZainAK283</span> Just to clarify, I'm not saying it can't be done but it will need some work. It's difficult to provide instructions that will work for any scenario, but FWIW I'm willing to help in this chat so there's a record of it. The easiest way is to start by installing Anaconda (<a href="https://anaconda.org/">https://anaconda.org/</a>). This should ideally take care of all the steps in the <code>Python 3.7</code> section of the install page. Then also install <code>nodejs</code> using the link just following the start of the <code>Install Lean-game-maker</code>section in the instructions. Don't worry about <code>pyenv</code> for now, as Anaconda will create a python <code>3.7.6</code> environment anyway; it will be called <code>base</code>. You should be able install in that environment.</p>

<p>Oh great, I didn't know you could create environments newer than the python version Anaconda ships with. <br>
But I'll advocate for using the default, currently 3.7.6, to start with. I had trouble with some newer versions (for 3.8.x I needed to upgrade <code>setuptools</code> etc.) which is not desirable for an initial install.</p>

<p>Thank you all for responding!<br>
If a windows install won't work, then I can use a WSL. In which case, everything is fine up until the last section of <a href="https://github.com/mpedramfar/Lean-game-maker/blob/master/INSTALL.md">https://github.com/mpedramfar/Lean-game-maker/blob/master/INSTALL.md</a></p>
<p>basically, I'm computer illiterate (my bad), so I'm not sure if I have nodejs and gettext, how to check if I do, or how to install in a WSL. I'm also not sure where the "virtual environment" i should type the last command</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="224572">@ZainAK283</span> Well, it appears there's some agreement that you could start by installing Anaconda, which has a very user-friendly Windows-like setup. Nodejs can also be installed in a similar way; just follow the links. Once that's done, we'll take it from there.</p>

<p>I think the games are a fantastic way to make Lean more accessible to beginners, especially those who are computer illiterate (even more than me!)<br>
After playing with NNG, playing more games means that by the time you decide to install lean locally, you've got a seriously solid grasp of how to lean</p>

<p>Totally. If everything were right (but it won't) you could just type the commands in the last section of the install page.<br>
For now, remove the <code>0</code> just after the <code>&gt;</code> and type "which npm" then enter. If that says nothing, try "whereis npm". I want to hope that the prompt interacts well with GitBash.</p>

<p>You can do all this in the Lean-game-maker directory. You can go there by <code>cd</code> which means "change directory". <br>
Like <code>cd C:\Users\Zain\...</code> <br>
We may actually need to connect in a visual way, unfortunately this will be too difficult by just typing instructions.</p>

<p>Zain two remarks: if you want to collaborate to make a game I'd be more than happy (real number game and group theory game are slowly becoming viable, complex number game exists but not in browser form, people are thinking about category theory game on the Discord, filter game was suggested last week and I think it will fly, other games are possible, I think there's scope for a topology game). And secondly you don't have to get the game maker installed on Windows to actually make the games, you just need the game maker to compile them. If you collaborate with someone who has access to a Linux machine they can compile for you</p>
