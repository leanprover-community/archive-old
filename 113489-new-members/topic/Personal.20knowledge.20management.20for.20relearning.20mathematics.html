<p>Hey folks, I am absolute neophyte with Lean. I learned some higher math and logic about 25 years ago, and have mostly forgotten it. I need a way to relearn. I'm thinking about using Emacs' Org-Roam to create a note-taking system. I want to mechanize as much as I can while relearning from grade-school level to grad-school level, and from 0 -&gt; O. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>
