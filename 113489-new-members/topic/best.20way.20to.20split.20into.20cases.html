<p>I am trying to prove a theorem which splits into cases based on the degree of a polynomial. In particular, if <code>f</code> is my polynomial, I have seperate cases for if <code>degree f</code> is <code>⊥</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, or <code>2</code>, and <code>n+3</code>, the final case requiring an induction. I have tried a few different approaches and haven't figured out a good way:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>cases</code> tactic replaces the instances of <code>degree f</code> in my goal, instead of giving me a term of type <code>degree f = ⊥</code> or <code>degree f = 0</code>, etc. I really need the term of type <code>degree f = ...</code>, so I tried hacking it in there with a variable (e.g. <code>let n = degree f, have  n = degree f, by simp [f], cases ...</code>) but I still wasn't able to figure out how to finish the proof this way</li>
<li>the <code>by_cases</code> tactic gives me the proposition I want, but at the end I am left with a bunch of <code>¬degree f = ...</code> assumptions, making for a messy proof by induction</li>
<li>if I try to switch into term mode and using a match statement like <code>exact match ... end</code> then Lean can't figure out any of the placeholders</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, it just feels clunky to not be able to match in tactic mode, instead having to eliminate on the <code>option</code> type and then three times in the match--is there a better way to do this?</p>

<p>you can probably prove <code>3 \le degree f</code> by <code>omega</code></p>

<p>posting your code would help a lot here</p>

<p>perhaps <code>by_cases h : degree f \le 2</code>, and then <code>interval_cases h</code>?</p>

<p>You might also find it helpful to introduce a new <code>n:nat</code>, with <code>h : n = degree f</code>, and then do induction on <code>n</code>.</p>

<p>Possibly with some <code>unfreezingI</code> magic</p>
