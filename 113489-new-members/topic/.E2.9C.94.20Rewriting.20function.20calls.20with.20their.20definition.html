<p>Say I have some function <code>def foo (x : nat) : nat := 2 * x</code> and later have some goal <code>foo x &gt;= x</code>. Is there a oneliner that rewrites this to <code>2 * x &gt;= x</code>? This is a very noob question, but I appear to have doc blindness tonight because I can't find it!</p>
<p>I know how to do it by introducing it as a hypothesis with <code>have</code> and then proving it by <code>refl</code>, but I need a version that doesn't require me to write out the function definition inline in the hypothesis because that's incredibly messy.</p>
<p>It's probably some version of <code>rw</code> that I'm just being blind to!</p>

<p>If you actually used <code>def</code>, then <code>foo</code> comes with a so-called equational lemma also called <code>foo</code> that will let you rewrite <code>foo x</code> to <code>2 * x</code>. If you rather used <code>let</code>, you're doomed and I would recommend switching to using <code>set</code>.</p>

<p>Oh no. The equational lemma works. I swear that was the first thing I tried before spending 20 minutes searching for something else... I must have done something stupid and convinced myself that the obvious thing doesn't work when it actually does. Sorry for the stupid question! All solved now.  I'm an idiot. Thanks.</p>
<p>Time for bed I think!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="428422">@Sam</span> if you make a definition then it's your job to make the API for the definition too. So directly afterwards you could prove <code>lemma foo_def {x} : foo x = 2 * x := rfl</code> and then you can rewrite that. Every definition has a cost because it adds one more layer of complexity.</p>

<p>Often we only need need a <code>foo_def</code> if <code>foo</code> was defined by a complicated induction (e.g. a with a <code>using_well_founded</code> or <code>mutual</code>).</p>

<p>Another exception to the rule is when an instance is involved, with lemmas like <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/pi.add_def">docs#pi.add_def</a></p>

<p>That lemma costs nothing to make and is easier for beginners to find.</p>
<p>Independent of that, another time I've seen a <code>foo_def</code> which is not covered by "an instance is involved" or "a complicated induction" is <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/continuous_def">docs#continuous_def</a> . Here we just want a rewritable statement for something which has been bundled.</p>

<p>As an aside, <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/attributes.html#mk_iff">attr#mk_iff</a> can actually generate lemmas like <code>continuous_def</code> which just unbundle / rebundle a structure</p>
