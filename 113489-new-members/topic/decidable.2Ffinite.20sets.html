<p>I have been using lists so far, but now I need to reason about what happens when merging lists without thinking of duplicates. Since I'm doing program verification, I would like to keep things decidable. I tried using <code>set</code> and <code>item \in set</code>, but I would need <code>decidable item set</code> at many locations for that. Is there some kind of decidable set? In my case, even finite sets would be sufficient.</p>

<p>I often use <code>alist</code> and/or <code>finmap</code> for my verified programming needs</p>

<p>but I think <code>finset</code> is the most exact match for what you are describing</p>

<p>Thanks, finset seems to be my solution. I had to search a little bit to find <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/data/finset/basic.html">the docs</a> though.</p>

<p>Documentation -- we are getting there, but for some of these files which have been around for several years there is certainly still some work to do.</p>

<p>All new files which go into mathlib must have proper documentation, but older files escaped this rule.</p>
