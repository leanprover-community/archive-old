<p>I've been doing Lean tutorials in my spare time for the past couple of weeks. I’d like to start taking steps to contribute to mathlib, and I’ll probably have about 1 hour per day to spare for this for now. </p>
<p>Firstly, my understanding is that the Lean community is interested in formalizing mathematics, and not so interested in formalizing theoretical computer science. Is my impression correct? (though I’ve also seen computability theory as a topic mathlib). </p>
<p>Regarding math, there are topics that I’m interested in and topics I’m not that interested in: I’m interested in both applied and pure math, but within pure math I’m mostly interested in topics that are foundational for parts of computer science, machine learning, and parts of physics. Also, if it’s more “fundamental”, I’ll be more motivated to work on it. But it doesn’t have to be exotic, and in fact I’d prefer to do quite basic things in Lean.</p>
<p>Looking at the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad_todo.html">Missing undergraduate mathematics in mathlib</a> page, some topics that I’d broadly be interested in working on within Mathlib are:<br>
Linear algebra<br>
Topology<br>
Measure theory<br>
Multivariable calculus and differential geometry<br>
Group theory<br>
Topics that are not on that list but that I’d still be interested in working on in Lean, are dynamical systems, theory of computation, high dimensional geometry, and parts of mathematical physics.<br>
I’m not really currently interested in topics such as: number theory, complex analysis (or mostly complex numbers generally), ring theory, representation theory.</p>
<p>By the way, I’ve started <a href="#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/Starting.20with.20formalizing.20undergraduate.20math/near/201001840">an earlier topic</a> a number of weeks ago, when I hadn’t gone through the Lean tutorials yet (mostly <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/">#mil</a> and #TPIL), and this message basically supersedes that one.</p>
<p>It seems to me that it would be good to start working within Lean on broadly one area so I build knowledge of how that area is formalized in Lean. So before picking my first problem it seems good to think about which area would be the best fit for me given my interests and given how doable it is to work on within Lean, etc. </p>
<p>So it seems like it would be good to think about on the one hand, which area I should start with and on the other hand, which initial problem(s) to try. Based on the topics that are written in <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad_todo.html">Missing undergraduate mathematics in mathlib</a>, my initial guess is that linear algebra or group theory would be the best fit, but people on Zulip chat seemed to have strong opinions about what are and aren’t good topics to start with, so I’m curious about people’s thoughts.</p>

<p>We're currently underrepresented in CS. I don't think the lack of CS formalizations is a deliberate choice</p>

<p>I agree with Mario, I think many people here would be interested in formalizing CS, and there are many people interested in program verification of course (have you seen the program verification stream? I think its an optional one you have to subscribe to separately). I think linear algebra is a great area to start in, for instance we only got the Cayley-hamilton theorem recently, so it seems there are a lot of things in that area that can be done but haven't yet.</p>

<p>Yes! Perhaps a good step is to pick a theorem that you'd guess is within reach, and ask for advice here. People will probably pile in giving suggestions about how to go about it (and possibly pointing out pitfalls!).</p>

<p>Yeah lemme echo Scott. Your first job is to isolate a precise mathematical statement or proof which you want to work on rather than just thinking about a general area. Then (esp if it involves new definitions) you should ask for advice on how to formalise any relevant intermediate statements</p>

<p>Yes it was definitely my intention to isolate a precise problem to work on. Regarding this, it seems that the (missing undergraduate math in mathlib)[https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad_todo.html] list is quite broad. i.e. it doesn't list pre-stated theorems that need proving, but mostly definitions and general topics. E.g. if I look at Linear algebra, there doesn't seem to be listed a clear problem, except perhaps Schur's lemma, though this seems too advanced.</p>
<p>Can we find a simple problem in linear algebra (preferably not related to matrices)?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I did, but I didn't explain the topics that I'm interested in in that post. I think proving that partial derivatives commute (or another suggestion by Gouezel, that  a C^k function is approximated by its k-th Taylor series up to o(norm(h) ^ k) ) is a possibility, but it's currently not the most interesting topic to me. But yes it's a possibility. Another topic from that thread: "Commuting operators are simultatneously diagonalizable" is  a possibility, though it seems complicated (I'd prefer to not deal with matrices, i.e. stay at a more abstract level, but it's a possibility).</p>

<p>I suspect that you would be better off picking a subject that's more obscure than linear algebra.  The low-hanging fruit tends to get done faster in fields (like linear algebra) which a lot of people know well.</p>

<p>If you're interested, I think it's a reasonable thing to try.  The point is that it satisfies the guidelines outlined by Scott and Kevin:  the definitions are already in mathlib, so you could get straight to the theorem itself.</p>

<p>Seems so! searched the repo and didn't find any usage, only its definition. It's also not labeled [simp] or something that can be used implicitly. I don't know yet how to verify/(compile?) the whole mathlib, but it's possible I need to do that in the future...</p>

<p>I guess the most obvious way to implement is to try to prove every statement with <code>library_search</code>, and complain if it finds a proof <code>by exact foo</code>?<br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> <br>
Is the less-powerful mode of library search cheap enough for this? (would it require an even weaker mode to get the behavior we want?)<br>
I guess this only helps if one of the files with the duplicate declaration imports the other. I expect that's true in a large fraction of cases?</p>

<p>That's way too expensive. The simple option is to throw everything in an <code>expr_map</code> and check for duplicates, but I think that will have false negatives</p>

<p><del>is there a notion of bounded definitional equality that's cheap enough to compute and gets rid of most of the false negatives?</del><br>
I think i don't have a model for what your false negative looks like. </p>
<p>Do you want the linter to catch two instances of the same lemma, but with the Prop arguments in a different order?</p>
