<p>Hello, I am new to lean, working on proving a simple lemma in lean4.  </p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">lemma</span> <span class="n">String.split_empty</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">):</span> <span class="n">String.split</span> <span class="s2">""</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">""</span><span class="o">]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I tried looking for existing theorems in mathlib, but it seems like there are no existing theorems about String.split?  In any case, I thought it should be easy to prove myself. </p>
<p>My first thought was to just expand definitions and it will probably become trivial.  I was able to rewrite String.split with "rw [String.split]" But this reveals a helper function <code>String.splitAux</code> that will not be rewritten by <code>rw [String.splitAux]</code>  I tried a few other tactics like unfold, simp, and dsimp, but none of them would touch splitAux.</p>
<p>I did notice that String.splitAux is a "partial def" unline String,split <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/0b243f0ca33e1f6a2948c94896b22b2f304ac4c8/src/Init/Data/String/Basic.lean#L188-L196">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/0b243f0ca33e1f6a2948c94896b22b2f304ac4c8/src/Init/Data/String/Basic.lean#L188-L196</a> so perhaps that is why it is not playing nice with theorem proving?</p>
<p>Any advice on what tactics I should use here?  Also, is there a general purpose tactic that will just "compute" the expressions?  What about a general purpose hammer tactic like in Coq?</p>
