<p>Hello, all.<br>
Trying this question again.<br>
So I have Lean 3.4.2 running in emacs lean-mode on a PC laptop in Lubunut 22.04 and I am working through the book Logic and Proof.<br>
I would also like to be able to work through the book Mathematics in Lean using the Mathlib library.<br>
I have downloaded the TryLean binary and it works, but I don't want to run vscode or vscodium if I can avoid doing so.<br>
Is there any way that I can just tell emacs to use the Mathlib library from the TryLean download? Or maybe just copy the Mathlib library files to someplace where  emacs lean-mode can see them?<br>
Thanks!</p>

<p>Lean 3.4.2 is really old.  Even if you get it working, it will require a really old version of Mathlib.  Is this what you want?  (Lean 3 was forked and taken over by the Lean community.  The current version is Lean 3.48c.)</p>

<p>Looking at <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/01_Introduction.html">https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/01_Introduction.html</a> I think you only need to do the following (none of these steps use vs code):</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/windows.html#installing-elan">elan installed</a> (so you can get whatever version of Lean you need)</li>
<li>Make sure you have <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/windows.html#installing-mathlib-supporting-tools">mathlibtools tools</a> installed</li>
<li>Use leanproject as follows: <code>leanproject get mathematics_in_lean</code> to make a project directory with the right version of lean and mathlib</li>
<li>Open that newly created directory in emacs.</li>
</ul>

<p>(I don't use emacs, windows, or mathematics in lean, so your mileage may vary with my directions. <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span> )</p>
