<p>I am new to Lean. I was doing the Natural numbers game. I don't know if you all heard of it but I am stuck in the advanced multiplication world. Can someone give me a hint how to prove <code>theorem mul_pos (a b : mynat) : a ≠ 0 → b ≠ 0 → a * b ≠ 0 :=</code>.</p>

<p>My instinct would be to show that a=succ(something), and then b=succ(something) and then deduce that a * b = succ(something) and hence not 0</p>

<p>I am also very new to Lean, but I found that when I was going through the Natural Numbers Game and I got to the Advanced Multiplication World, my thinking had to shift from 'follow your nose and just do the most obvious thing at each step' to 'think about it mathematically, how you would prove it with a pen and paper, and then formalise it' - I got stuck on this level too when just trying to do the most obvious thing at each step!</p>

<p>Looking at the answers in the github repo, my sketch proof above seems to be the one in the repo and it comes out relatively painlessly, you finish with <code>succ_ne_zero</code>. I agree that at some point you have to stop following your nose! We get a fair few questions about level 4 of advanced multiplication world here. Hopefully the comments in the level now make it easier, but it's still a toughie.</p>

<p>This question is about the next one where I also struggled. <code>theorem eq_zero_or_eq_zero_of_mul_eq_zero (a b : mynat) (h : a * b = 0) :
  a = 0 ∨ b = 0 :=</code> I want to prove it with <code>exfalso</code> since I have <code>h: succ c * succ d = 0</code> and I want to prove <code>succ c \ne 0</code> and <code>succ d \ne 0</code> and use this fact to apply <code>mul_pos</code>,  but how should I write that down in Lean?</p>

<p>Hi everyone,<br>
I'm stuck when solving the Natural number game level 10.<br>
could anybody teach me how to do next?<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/3121/l4AVf4siZKCMuBck6JQFlLaL/image.png">image.png</a> <br>
at the same time, however, when i'm trying to solve the problem, i happen to  type like this:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/3121/JTN_vbYCzcyhkIEsXPOq33q3/image.png">image.png</a> <br>
it says that the goal is completed<br>
i'm comfused about what's happening</p>

<p>The first tip is to post urls to the level you are talking about, especially since you didn't mention a world name. <a href="https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/?world=8&amp;level=10">https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/?world=8&amp;level=10</a> Then you can copy-paste text instead of screenshots so that people can read them easily and copy-paste them into the game.</p>

<p>Hi! Does anyone know if I can install the Natural numbers game on my computer with blank copies of the exercises? At the moment each task has the solution filled in already, and I'd like to work through these myself before looking at the solutions. For some reason it's not saving my progress when I try this online :( thanks!</p>

<p>Hmm. I would be tempted to just rewrite the game yourself :-)</p>
<p>Unfortunately the framework we used to make NNG meant that we had to also supply all solutions. If you would like to work on basic Lean stuff on your own computer then maybe you'd prefer the <a href="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/complex-number-game">complex number game</a> which you can just download and install and fill in the sorrys yourself. This game assumes that we have a fully working copy of the real numbers to hand, and then makes the complex numbers from scratch.</p>

<p>I guess the full nerd thing to do would be to download the NNG repo with <code>leanproject</code> and then write a regex which matches the <code>begin [natnumgame] ... end</code> blocks and sorries them out.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="421132">@Gemma Crowe</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> I wonder if some cunning search and replace can take all of the begin &lt; stuff&gt; end blocks from the completed files with solutions and replace them with begin sorry end ?</p>

<p>As usual with grep/sed/awk, as soon as you need to spend more than ten seconds thinking about how to do it, you'll have an easier time writing a python script doing it. See for instance how this problem is handled in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lftcm2020/blob/master/mk_exercises.py">https://github.com/leanprover-community/lftcm2020/blob/master/mk_exercises.py</a></p>

<p>Yes. I was thinking something like:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">read</span> <span class="n">line</span>
<span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">it</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="kd">begin</span><span class="bp">?</span>
   <span class="n">write</span>  <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">output</span> <span class="n">file</span><span class="o">:</span>
        <span class="kd">begin</span>
        <span class="gr">sorry</span>
        <span class="kd">end</span>
<span class="k">else</span>
    <span class="n">write</span> <span class="n">line</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">output</span> <span class="n">file</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I've not really looked at Python. C and C++ were more my thing. Plus a whole load of shell and other scripting. Although I never really got deeply into sed and awk.</p>
