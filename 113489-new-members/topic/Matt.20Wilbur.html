<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I am about as brand-new as one can be to this area.  I am a software developer who has been trying to learn various aspects of mathematics on my own for years.  One of my desires has been to use a computer to help me keep my proofs "honest" when I'm learning or trying to fill in the holes of a proof in a book or article since I have no guide or mentor to ask (e.g. I read "clearly P implies Q" and feel like I should go put on a dunce cap since it's not clear to me at all).  I don't care if I have to translate an "elegant proof" down to it's most basic building blocks and combine them together if it means I'm learning more.  </p>
<p>Thanks for reading this and thanks for making so much available online.  I have spent the last few evenings working through the Natural Number game and have been just loving it.</p>
<p>Matt</p>
