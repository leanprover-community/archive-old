<p>End users don't need to worry about this. This is all to do with core Lean files and development of  stuff which is fundamental to the system.  IIRC it means "this file is part of the stuff which is loaded initially by any Lean session, so in particular don't load it here" -- you might find that if you write <code>prelude</code> at the top of a file then you might not be able to do stuff like <code>#print nat</code> because not even that got loaded.</p>
