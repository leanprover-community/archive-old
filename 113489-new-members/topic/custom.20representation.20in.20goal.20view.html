<p>Is there a way to change the way terms are shown in the goal view with a custom representation? Like what <code>has_repr</code> does for <code>#eval</code>, but for the goal view</p>

<p>If there were, it would have to operate on <code>expr</code>s and not terms of that type</p>

<p>Do you have an example of what you hope to use this for? Maybe the Rubik's cube and Hanoi widget examples are close to what you're hoping for.</p>

<p>I didn't know those project, I'll check them out. My problem is essentially that I don't understand how <code>notation</code> works with the infoview. Sometimes terms are printed in the custom notation I define, while other times the notation gets unfolded into a rather unreadable term which the custom notation shouls stand for. I would like the infoview to always show these terms using the <code>notation</code> I define and I don't know how to achieve that.</p>

<p>I think what you're referring to is what lean4 calls a "deelaborator", and lean3 doesn't have them</p>
