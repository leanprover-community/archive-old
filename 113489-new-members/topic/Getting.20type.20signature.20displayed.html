<p>Is there a way in the vscode extension to get the type signature displayed other than <code>#check</code>?</p>

<p>You can hover over names in the middle of term proofs (and sometimes in tactic proofs) to see a popup with the type. If your text cursor is in the middle of such a name, there's a spot in the status bar that shows the type (sadly, it won't be displayed if it's too long).</p>
<p>If you want to look up the type of a declaration, you can hit Ctrl+T for the "symbol search". Then if you type in what you're interested in, you should see the type in the list of suggestions.</p>
<p>I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="121918">@Edward Ayers</span>'s <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/pull/159">infoview rework</a> may also include widgets that allow one to inspect the types of terms in the tactic state / goal.</p>

<p>Another option (for term proofs) is to surround the code you're interested in with <code>{!</code> and <code>!}</code>, then select the "show term" code action from the "lightbulb" menu. See also <a href="#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/vscode.20snippets/near/179122991">this message</a> which gives code for a keybinding that makes using hole commands easier.</p>
