<p>Hello. I've successfully installed Lean. I used instruction from Lean Community's web-page. So I installed Git, Git Bash, Python, Extension for VS Code and so on. But I have two questions:<br>
Question 1: It's about deleting Git, Git Bash and Python after installing. I don't use Git , I don't  use Python as programming language. I don't understand one step after installing extension in VS Code: On Command Palette you need type Select Default Profile and choose Git Bash. I won't do this yet, but Lean works, I've tried some code. What does it mean and if it's not necessary to choose Git Bash can I delete it? Can I delete Python or works of Lean depends on Python?<br>
Question 2: For example, I want to install Lean on computer without an access to Internet. I can copy VS Code,  extension for Lean, Python (if it need) from USB-disk on that computer. But how to install Lean Prover itself? What files I need?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="544604">@Damir Gabitov</span> It is very hard to use Lean effectively without Python. Using it without git might be possible, but I strongly advice against it.</p>

<p>It all depends on what you want to do. If you ever want to make a new project, it is immediate with python and extremely inconvenient without. If you ever want to put a project online it is easy with git and inconvenient without. If you want to download a project from the internet then it is easy with git and python and extremely inconvenient without.</p>

<p>So, than it's better for me not delete Python and Git, although I've installed Lean for learning proving on it, and I  won't be use it for creating  online projects, and I think I won't be use Git . Installation of Lean takes a lot of commands. Is it possible to create .exe file for installing Lean itself?  For example, if I'm going to install in on computer without Internet?</p>

<p>Ok, I will try files from GitHub . At this moment Lean works on VS Code on my computer. Can you explain what this files on GitHub: lean-...-darwin.zip, lean-...-windows.zip.? I saw darwin on Coq system too. (As I understand SourceCode.zip is need compilation on C compiler)</p>

<p>Are you more mathematically or computer-science inclined? For maths you should install Lean 3 following the instructions on the leanprover-community website. For CS you should install Lean 4 following instructions on Microsoft's website.</p>

<p>Then go with elan, VS Code and the Lean 4 extension. And also create or download a project to hack on Lean (using the nightly versions which are much more up to date), don't just edit a random lean file and expect things to work out of the box. Lean works much better in a project.</p>

<p>For using Lean 4, install elan using the instructions from <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/elan">https://github.com/leanprover/elan</a> (it's just <code>curl ... | sh</code> and it performs a user installation), as the <code>elan</code> Debian package is currently incompatible with Lean 4 (<code>apt remove</code> it first if you've already installed it).</p>
