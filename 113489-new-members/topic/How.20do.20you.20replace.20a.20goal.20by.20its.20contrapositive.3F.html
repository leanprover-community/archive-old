<p>For eg:  Your goal is to show a=b =&gt; c=d. How do you replace this goal to c!=d =&gt; a!=b? <br>
Thank You!</p>

<p>I just finished the game and found it mostly easy (but I already have a little experience with formal provers). In particular, the commutativity theorems, which are referred as "bosses", are not more difficult than the other levels, in my opinion. The only level that took me a bit more of time was 3.12: my main mistake was to try to do induction on a, while it is more appropriate to do it on b and c (the fact that you need two inductions is itself an element of difficulty).</p>
<p>Other than that, for a few levels I used tactics that had not been introduced already. For example, I don't think the instruction ever say how to destruct inequality (I don't remember the level number). I could carry on only because I already suspected that inequality is "equality implies false". In the same and possibly other levels you also need to that you can use exfalso or directly destruct false.</p>

<p>Documenting destructing inequality is what I will be working on within an hour. I had not realised until today that you can solve all of world 4 including all prerequisites without ever using the <code>intro</code> tactic. Everyone is complaining that this is what they don't know how to do and I'm trying to fix it ASAP.</p>

<p>Note that <code>a ≠ 0 → b ≠ 0 → a * b ≠ 0</code> should be read as <code>a ≠ 0 → (b ≠ 0 → a * b ≠ 0)</code> and <code>x → (y → z))</code> is equivalent to <code>((x ∧ y) → z)</code>. So there are two assumptions to the theorem, and you can apply <code>intro</code> twice to get at them.</p>

<p>Mathematicians do not know Curry-Howard! This is exactly the point! It's so interesting! It's really easy to train them all to use <code>rw</code> and <code>induction</code> but their way of thinking about implicitions is so different to Lean's that it can be really confusing. The first tactic taught in TPIL is <code>apply</code>.</p>
