<p>I want to perform reduction to a sub expression of the goal (or maybe any hypothesis in context), how do I do it?</p>

<p><code>unfold</code> doesn't seem to be what I want since it only unfolds definition? But I want to perform a reduction</p>

<p>do you want to unfold definitions or don't you? :-) There are several ways you can deal with definitions -- you can make them <code>[reducible]</code> or even abbreviations, or unfold them, and it wouldn't surprise me if you can tag them with simp as well if you want simp to do the job.</p>

<p>How do I make sure unfold also does a reduction. Sometimes it seems unfold will just unfold the function, instead of applying it?</p>
