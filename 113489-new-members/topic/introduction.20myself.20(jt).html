<p>Hello,<br>
My name is Justin Thomas. I have a PhD but now do software for a living. I have seen some others here with similar stories, which is very cool. I have been nosing around the website for a while and thought maybe I should introduce myself. I am currently working through the tutorial. I have in the past played around with coq, using <a href="https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/">https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/</a>, but saw a talk by Kevin Buzzard (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp-mQ3HxgDE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp-mQ3HxgDE</a>) that pulled me over to Lean. I don't have some grand picture of what I want to contribute, so I am happy to take a look at some of the "boring but not too hard" things others just haven't had time for. My PhD work involved algebraic topology, homotopy theory, operads and the like. Those are my interests mathematically, but I also have quite a bit of programming experience now, so I feel there are many ways I can contribute. Anywho, I'll just keep working through the tutorial. If anyone has any suggestions of low-hanging fruit, I'd love to contribute sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>I understand generalities might replace specialized statements. That seems like the natural way of things. For learning, it seems like some specializations are actually preferred. At least that is my first impression. </p>
<p>Anyway, I got to spend a half hour or so looking at the Undergrad TODO trivial targets. From what I understand, Zulip is the right place for the following questions.</p>
<p>I am focusing on what looks the simplest:<br>
<strong>Linear algebra / finite rank of a set of vectors.</strong></p>
<p>From what I can tell, I would put a def somewhere in linear_algebra.finite_dimensional. Perhaps near the line<br>
 /-- The submodule generated by a single element is finite-dimensional. -/<br>
 Then I would update undergrad.yaml to point to this definition.</p>
<p>After that, clean up style, naming, documentation, make pull request, yadda yadda?</p>

<p>This is more or less what one is supposed to do. But if you write a new<code>def</code>, you should also provide a basic API. This means essentially making the definition useful for other, proving trivial results. (And I really mean trivial, something like "the rank of a family is the dimension of the span, or whatever". This is of course true by definition, but it is useful to have it). Also very easy lemmas (like the rank of the zero vector is zero and so on) will be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi, <br>
I have just finished the natural number game. What should I do next?</p>
<p>I want to work in a particular area of applied model theory, which talks a lot about real fields, valued fields, etc., these seem to be well represented in the library. But there isn't any work on the first order logic? Say, the first order compactness theorem? </p>

<p>thank you all for the input. Not much to say from me right now except that I am definition-chasing at the moment around minpoly / linear_algebra / data.polynomial land to try to narrow the scope of this in my mind. The syntax in the statement of the expected type above is super helpful</p>

<p>(not sure if it is time for me to start a new thread...)<br>
I am still working to add some simple results about <code>annihilating ideal</code>.  I cannot seem to find some existing code showing <code>k[x]</code> is a PID if <code>k</code> is a field. Seems there are a lot of things close to this, but I just can't seem to get the hang of searching for existing results.</p>

</code></pre></div>
<p>From this I am trying to specialize to the case <code>A = \bbk</code>, a field, then say <code>minpoly u</code> generates the annihilating ideal.<br>
This has not gotten very far though. For the first step, I am trying to use some existing code to grab the annihilating ideal generator:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">variable</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="bp">𝕜</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span><span class="bp">*</span><span class="o">}</span>
<span class="kd">variables</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">field</span> <span class="bp">𝕜</span><span class="o">]</span>

  <span class="n">submodule.is_principal.generator</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">annihilating_ideal</span> <span class="n">u</span><span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>But this complains <code>failed to synthesize type class instance for ...</code> I assume it cannot infer <code>submodule.is_principal</code>, so I tried to convince it that <code>\bbk [x]</code> satisfies <code>is_principal_ideal_ring</code>. This is the part I thought I could find somewhere already. <br>
I am still learning how to read lean error messages, and how unification and type-classes work, so I am not sure I am on the right track here</p>
<p>Update: silly error. I switched to <code>k</code> as the field name but left <code>A</code> in the <code>def</code>. After putting <code>k</code> in the def. It seems happy.</p>

<p>I'd like to get some review on this implementation of annihilating ideal. I started a pull request just as an easy way to see the diffs. I actually meant to leave the pull request in my twoquarterrican fork of the repo, but messed up. Anyway, I can move it if need be.</p>
<p>Main points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Had a lot of trouble getting types to line up for alg_hom versus ring_hom and for with_bot \nat versus \nat. I would love some help on how to handle this better. Currently there are simple lemmas added in a couple places since that is the try among dozens of things that actually worked. </li>
<li>Have annihilating_ideal defined. The names are pretty long. I see abbreviations are common in the code, but a lot of them don't make sense to me so I think I need some help on how to name things better.</li>
<li>I just covered the very basic goal of showing that the minpoly generates the annihilating ideal in the \bbk [x] case. Surely there are some other things I can add to fill it out a bit more.</li>
<li>Proofs use only the few tactics I know. They appear longer and accomplish less than most other proofs I have seen. I don't mind it though. I like running through the tactics when they do a little bit at a time. It is fun. Anyway, I can make these more sleek with help and a good reason to.<br>

<p>Re (2): Merging is completely fine.<br>
Re (3): Only to the PR message. PRs are merged using squash commits, so you don't have to worry about how you name intermediate commits.</p>
