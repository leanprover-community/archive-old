<p>Is it possible to add a search box to  &lt;<a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/">https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/</a>&gt;? One could  use the <code>inurl:</code> directive in google but having to type it each time is a minor inconvenience.</p>

<p>Our Zulip archive is generated by the scripts <a href="https://github.com/robertylewis/zulip-archive">here</a>. I don't know that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110596">@Rob Lewis</span> will have time to work on it anytime soon, but I think PRs are welcome!</p>

<p>Is there much point? The search inside zulip is almost certainly more powerful</p>

<p>Well, I could imagine people not wanting to sign into Zulip.</p>

<p>I'm not sure we want to invest too much time in this archive. The main point is that search engines can index it so that people can discover that we have good stuff here and sign in. But I think there is no much point into encouraging people not to come here.</p>
