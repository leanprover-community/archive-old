<p>I saved a file on vscode with lean extension but after closing it, the file either disappears or shows 0 kb. I'm not sure what the problem is</p>

<p>Do you have write access to the directory you're saving the file to? Is it on some networked drive or something?</p>

<p>Yes, I have access. Actually, after closing the file, it sometimes shows the message 'updating vscode' , and then all saved files and folders disappear . When it doesn't, they are retained, as far as I've observed and remember</p>

<p>It's a bit hard to figure out what's going on without more info: <br>
- What OS are you on and what version of VS Code are you using? <br>
- Are you using any extensions other than <code>vscode-lean</code>? <br>
- Can you check out the logs corresponding to the sessions where files aren't successfully saved? (see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46373762/where-are-visual-studio-code-log-files" target="_blank" title="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46373762/where-are-visual-studio-code-log-files">this link</a> for the log locations)</p>
