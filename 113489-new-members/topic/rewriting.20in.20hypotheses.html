<p>I'm working through the natural number game (which is really great, by the way, so thank you!) and I'm on level 2-12: showing that <code>a + b = a → b = 0</code>. Starting with <code>intro h,</code> takes me to</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>a b : mynat,
h : a + b = a
⊢ b = 0
</pre></div>


<p>and what I'd like to do now is rewrite <code>h</code> with <code>add_zero</code> to get <code>a + b = a + 0</code>, but I can't figure out how to just rewrite the _last_ occurrence of <code>a</code>. If I do <code>rw ← add_zero a at h,</code> then it replaces _both_ <code>a</code>s with <code>a + 0</code>, which I don't want, and if I don't give <code>add_zero</code> an argument then I get an error, so I'm not sure how to even just rewrite the first <code>a</code> (if I could, then I could somehow use <code>symmetry</code> to get what I want (and this is a bonus question: how can I apply <code>symmetry</code> to <code>h</code>? Using <code>symmetry at h</code> (my naive guess) doesn't work)).</p>

<p>In fact I'd be very interested to hear what other problems there are after 2-6; I didn't really think hard about those at all. [by which I mean: I was more concerned with documenting 3-1 to 3.6 than 2-7 to 2-16]</p>

<p>I am surprised <code>symmetry at h</code> doesn't work -- I thought I had realised that this was something which should be useful and someone made a pull request to make it happen. You could do <code>have h2 := h.symm</code>, that would give you <code>a = a + b</code>, but it wouldn't solve your rewriting problem.</p>

<p>Oh! Just looking back through old PR's I find this: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/1269" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/1269">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/1269</a> -- apparently you have to use <code>symmetry'</code>and I don't think I imported this into the natural number game :-/ I'll fix this in v1.1. I think <code>symmetry at h</code> is a very good guess and it should work, and I think I have the power to make it work (thanks to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110596">@Rob Lewis</span> ). The issue is that <code>symmetry</code> is defined in core Lean so we can't mess with it and add the "at h" functionality, but I can mess with it in the natural number game because I am already basically using a hacked Lean.</p>

<p>I'm starting to get into Lean. I've been wanting to get into proof assistants for quite some time, coming from a theoretical background, but never managed to decide which one was 'best' to learn. I started playing this game though and before I knew it I had already learnt more than I had in any other assistant, so probably just going to explore Lean a bit more</p>

<p>Yes, <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> are surrounding the text box which you can type in in the natural number game. I'm a mathematician, and for me, the proofs are always the most fun part. My original ideas about how to teach this stuff are here <a href="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2017/10/31/building-the-non-negative-integers-from-scratch/" target="_blank" title="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2017/10/31/building-the-non-negative-integers-from-scratch/">https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2017/10/31/building-the-non-negative-integers-from-scratch/</a> but the game is an attempt to make it much easier for the end user.</p>

<p>in 2-13, there's the hint of using <code>zero_ne_succ</code>, which seems to imply that maybe we want to be doing a proof by contradiction? is this something that you can do in Lean, or are proofs by contradiction not 'constructive' enough?</p>

<p>Yeah, I think this is pretty much impossible to solve given what I've told you. I'll need to document this a bit better. I had to release the game because chalkdust was coming out and in it I claim that the game will be ready, whereas in fact I had several other big things going on in my life (teaching and a deadline for the perfectoid paper) so these later world 2 levels are very rough around the edges. I will try and fix them up this weekend once I've read the 717 unread emails in my inbox</p>

<p>Absolutely.

I would be completely happy to have 25 trivial comments. There are several completely minor things there already. I plan on releasing v1.01 soon after all the admin for my course is over (i.e. soon after 1st November) with a ton of minor bug fixes and corrections. I know this should all have been done before v1.0 but I wanted to release the game at the same time as the chalkdust magazine came out.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="116045">@Jesse Michael Han</span>'s answer is part of what <code>cases</code> does. <br>
<code>cases</code> also has special support for equality between constructors of an inductive type. It will apply <code>nat.no_confusion</code> in your example (which is almost the same as <code>encode</code> in HoTT. This means that if <code>h</code> is an equality between two different constructors, then it will close the goal, and if <code>h</code> is an equality between the same constructor, it will derive the equalities between the arguments of this constructor, and apply cases to those equalities.</p>
