<p>I apologize if that was covered before, but I'm now reading through Theorem proving in Lean and stumbled upon the 'list' thing. Why does 'list' has a type of Type u → Type u? Shouldn't the type of lists of elements of some type have its own type? If not, why it's so? The same seems to apply to 'prod' and some others. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>It seems that you might be jumping two levels in the type hierarchy here. It's not about "some natural number and a list of natural numbers," but rather "the type of natural numbers and the type of lists of natural numbers".  One way <code>nat</code> and <code>list nat</code> are "the same" objects is that they're both inductive types, and they're both in <code>Type</code>.</p>

<p><code>1</code> is of type <code>nat</code><br>
<code>[1, 2, 3]</code> is of type <code>list nat</code></p>
<p><code>nat</code> is a type, so <code>nat</code> is of type <code>Type u</code> for some universe <code>u</code><br>
<code>list nat</code> is also a type, so <code>list nat</code> is of type <code>Type u</code>, such that the type <code>nat</code> lives in <code>u</code></p>

<p>For me personally it has been much easier to let go off my usual idea of what a type is from regular languages like Java etc. when learning Lean. This is because in Lean everything has a type while in regular languages only values have a type.</p>
<p>Every natural number <strong>value</strong> is of type <code>Nat</code>, the <strong>type</strong> <code>Nat</code> is of type <code>Type</code>.<br>
List is a type constructor so a function that takes in a type (the type of its members) and produces a new one (the type of lists with the members of the parameter type), written out its type is: <code>Type u -&gt; Type u</code>. When we are working with <code>Type</code> as the type of members of the list  (which is just an alias for <code>Type 0</code>) this turns out to be: <code>Type 0 -&gt; Type 0</code> or written a little shorter: <code>Type -&gt; Type</code>. So now if we pass in the <code>Nat</code> type we get some type <code>List Nat</code> which itself has type <code>Type</code>.</p>
<p>So now both the <code>Nat</code> <strong>type</strong> and the <code>List Nat</code> <strong>type</strong> have type <code>Type</code>. However the nat <strong>values</strong> have type <code>Nat</code> and the lists that contain nats have type <code>List Nat</code></p>

<p>Hmm, Lean has a lot of features so an adequate material will depend on what you're struggling with in the most fundamental level. Are you used to the functional paradigm? Dependent types? Theorem proving? What's your background?</p>

<p>You could play the natural number game although its more of a "how does basic induction, rewriting and logic work in Lean" rather than an intro to Lean itself. My strategy with learning about stuff in Lean has been to keep pushing against the issue for quite a while (my definition of while here includes several days), try to read code that is related to my issue (although that does of course only work if you have at least basic understanding of Lean), ask people here in that order....aaaand usually it does work out although its of course a lengthy process at times <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span></p>

<p>I don't have any solid academic background. I do some economics stuff and occasionally teach some undergrad math (nothing harder than basic linear algrebra our multivariable calculus) to grown ups who most of the time work in IT, hence the idea to learn Lean in order to introduce them to proofs in a manner they might percieve easier to begin with.</p>
<p>I've played numbers game and did some exercises in the tutorials (those devoted to the basic theorems of analysis). However I feel that without the more fundamental understanding it all revolves around learning a handful of tactics which work in predefined structures and situations. That way it looks more like learning-by-doing, rather than understanding what you're doing and why it works.</p>

<p>If <code>nat : Type</code>, then <code>list nat : Type</code> according to the type of <code>list</code>. They do have their own types, but the type of their types is <code>Type</code>.

<p>yeah, I get that, but 22 and 37 are 'the same' objects, while some natural number and a list of a natural numbers aren't exactly the same in many ways we may be interested in</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>Type</code> represents precisely the ways they <em>are</em> the same. If it helps, I think of this quite like the "real world". If I ask you what's in common between wheat and barley, you say "those are grains". If I say "piano and guitar", you say "instruments". If I say "wheat, barley, piano, and guitar", you get a bit confused, but we indeed have ways to classify these together, say "objects" or "matter". Sometimes indeed we do need to talk about these disparate objects together, so we have words for the less "tightly related" groups, or for groups of groups themselves. In programming languages, we do too, the way Lean calls the "group of groups" is <code>Type</code>, it's a way of referring to all of a set of different kinds of objects together, and there are things that are in common to every type, even if they're simple ones like "they have a name".</p>

<p>1) yep, I am, though having <strong>both</strong> natural numbers and their lists displaying the same type  is kinda awkward, but guess if any type has to belong to some higher type, we can find something common between numbers and lists to justify that</p>

<p>my confusion arises from the fact that types aren't exactly sets and as far as I can get it, types assume some additional properties about its terms, unlike sets, which say nothing about the elements except for they belong to a set.</p>
<p>intuitively I don't see a lot in common between natural numbers and lists of natural numbers, so when they both are said to have the same type it rings a bell that something isn't right as I fail to think of properties that would be true both for natural numbers and for 'natural lists' which would justify them being typed the same.</p>

<p>that is, in some ways, true. we have that if <code>a : T₁</code>, then <code>a : T₂</code> is false unless <code>T₁ = T₂</code>. but you can build these up however you want; for example, you could do your type using the disjoint union <code>Crocodiles ⊕ Functions ⊕ Numbers ⊕ Hamburgers</code>; now a term of <code>Crocodiles</code> isn't a term of that disjoint union type, but you place a thin wrapper around it (<code>sum.inl</code>) and it is.</p>

<p>Maybe if you have a CS background this is a productive point of view, but I teach Lean to mathematicians and I tell them all on day 1 that a Type is just what Lean calls a set and for now that's all they need to know. I think this is a useful model to begin with.</p>

<p>I should add that you just used the word "intutionistic", and discussions of various weak non-classical logics such as that and constructivism do not occur in my classes; we work with classical logic throughout. Again this reflects the background of the students I'm teaching.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="284160">@Eric Rodriguez</span> thank you, I'll keep in mind that types can be used that way, finding something common in things that aren't exactly the same at the first glance</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> Indeed, my experience is shaped by lots of additional materials I have to browse through to make things a bit more clear, say, this type theory related course: <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/317-f18/schedule.html">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/317-f18/schedule.html</a>  and many others</p>
<p>In that way both Lean and type theory are usually seen as a development of constructionist ideas and it's highlighted that those ideas make it possible to efficiently verify all the proofs</p>

<p>Lean's core code contains nonconstructive axioms and these axioms are used everywhere in Lean's developments of mathematics. We are rejecting constructivism in our mathematics library and this is what makes it so much more powerful than many of the other libraries out there.</p>

<p>The decades-old computer science story that constructivism somehow makes mathematics more powerful is something which mathematicians saw through about 100 years ago. Since that time classical mathematics has produced milestone after milestone (Fermat's Last Theorem, the Poincare conjecture etc etc) and it is these sorts of results which we are longingly looking forward to here in the Lean mathematical community.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> so, one could say that the guiding criteria for adopting some sort of foundations or general way of thinking among the math community mostly relies on its potential to produce new results, rather than some other aspects?</p>

<p>The theorem proving community contains many provers, and many communities of users, each with their own viewpoints, aims etc. As a resolutely classical mathematician myself, my aim has always been to grow mathlib as a classical library, with the model in my head that Type = set. There are people who use other theorem provers with other axioms and whose model of a type is some complex kind of topological space defined up to homotopy. I'm not speaking for those people. I'm talking only about my personal aim for the community's mathematics library, but I would say that there are many other contributors here who are equally happy to reject constructivism. I'm bringing this up now because if you are interested in constructivism then Lean might not be the prover for you -- or perhaps it's more accurate to say that Lean is perfectly happy to be constructive but you might not find much of a support group here when you get stuck.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> I don't think my final goals make me competent enough to reason about the prefered logical paragidm, given that what exists now isn't in a need of an immediate replacing. However, some materials associated with automatic provers and type theory tend to present things that way, saying that type theory being adopted as the new foundations (with all the assumed features) is the only way for math to progress.</p>

<p>Well I work in a building full of people who are extremely skeptical about that idea, based on the fact that math has progressed very nicely for the last 2500 years without these automatic provers. One could regard the mathlib effort as some kind of attempt to at least get up to speed with the statements of modern mathematics.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> in his video devoted to provers (and establishing the research center) Hoskinson mentioned that provers might aid the progress of math by allowing for an easier transfer of experience via libraries, since actual mathematicians are prone to dying and the ratio of an active career years to studying aren't very good.  </p>
<p>perhaps you see the most potential in that regard?</p>

<p>We'll see what they end up doing. I am too cautious to predict the future. I just have genuine optimism that they will help mathematics somehow but I have only been in this area a few years. I suspect people have been saying all sorts of things about what theorem provers will or might do ever since theorem provers have existed.</p>
