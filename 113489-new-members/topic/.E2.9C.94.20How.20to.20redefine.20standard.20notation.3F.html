<p>Even with these considerations in mind, I still want to have a choice to ignore the standard library.</p>

<p>I think you will experience a lot of frustration. This is simply not Lean's strong point. There are proof assistants that are probably much more friendly for people who want to experiment from scratch. Did you try Agda for instance?</p>

<p>Another option is to build lean from source and remove unwanted parts from the standard library.</p>

<p>I looked at Agda but from a glance it seems almost abandoned. Also I hear they do not have tactics. I should look at it more thoroughly some day.</p>

<p>If you don't use the full prelude, you'll also find yourself with very little in the way of tactics</p>

<p>Agda is far from abandoned. And yes, they don't have tactics, but that's mostly because they claim that their language is so good and flexible that they don't need tactics.</p>
