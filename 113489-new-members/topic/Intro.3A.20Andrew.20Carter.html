<p>Hey everyone, I work on graph databases at LinkedIn (that is to say a database modelled as a graph - as opposed to a database of interesting graphs). I have an unexplored soft spot theorem provers, and in particular I was thinking about exploring algorithmic complexity.</p>

<p>Hi! I am happy to see you here!</p>
<p>As for complexity theory, you would have to start formalizing it in Lean almost from scratch. Unfortunately, it seems nobody wants to start; see the previous discussion:<br>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="437861">@Praneeth Kolichala</span>  <a href="#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/Computability.2C.20P.20.28and.20NP.29/near/309526767">was looking</a> for people who were interested in Complexity Theory. It sounds like fun, and I've made attempts to do it in the past, but I don't have time these days to spend on another project.</p>
