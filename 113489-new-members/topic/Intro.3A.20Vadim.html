<p>Hi everyone, <br>
My name is Vadim. By profession, I do NLP, which is to say I teach neural networks to work with texts.<br>
I recently got interested in the topic of proof-assistants. I think this community is very inspiring, because it makes new infrastructure for creating and storing knowledge.<br>
I have a little project that I'd like to develop on top of Lean. Can anyone point me to how to talk to Lean in Python? (Like a nice wrapper, or starting a server and talking via API, or something).<br>
Additionally, would anyone be interested in doing a little coding with me? (Skill context: I'm not super deep into Lean, although I did pass the Natural Numbers Game)</p>

<p>You should probably have a look at what happens in the <a href="#narrow/stream/219941-Machine-Learning-for-Theorem-Proving">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/219941-Machine-Learning-for-Theorem-Proving</a> stream</p>
