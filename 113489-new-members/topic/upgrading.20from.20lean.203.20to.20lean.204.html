<p>Hi, I am trying to get the quickstart at <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/quickstart.html">https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/quickstart.html</a> going.<br>
I ran it with standard options and everything runs fine, but when I check for version lean is still at 3.33.0<br>
Is there some action I need to take first, if I previously installed lean 3?<br>
I am also new to Zulip, so sorry if this is the wrong place for questions like this. <br>
I tried to uninstall lean first via 'elan self uninstall' and got the following error message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>info: removing leanpkg home<br>
info: removing elan binaries<br>
error: failure during windows uninstall<br>
info: caused by: Access is denied. (os error 5)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How are you checking the version? <code>elan</code> automatically decides which version of Lean to use depending on what it sees. If you are not in a directory with either of <code>leanpkg.toml</code> or a <code>lakefile.lean</code>, you should not expect this to work automatically.</p>

<p>As <code>lake</code> isn't quite ready for primetime, I would suggest you need a <code>leanpkg.toml</code> file, which you can create by using <code>leanpkg init</code>.</p>
