<p>Is this the best place to ask very basic questions?  (or is Discord a better place to ask?)</p>
<p>I'm trying to understand some notation, what is the best way to look up notation?  Specifically, what does the special brace in the definition of "is_compact" mean?<br>
<code>def is_compact (s : set Œ±) := ‚àÄ ‚¶Éf‚¶Ñ [ne_bot f], f ‚â§ ùìü s ‚Üí ‚àÉa‚ààs, cluster_pt a f</code><br>
the thing around the <code>f</code>.</p>

<p>That is "semi-implicit", which means that it is automatically inserted only if you provide an argument after it</p>

<p>That way you can write just <code>h : is_compact s</code> and it won't get auto-instantiated to <code>h _</code></p>

<p>but if you write <code>h (h' : f &lt;= P s)</code> then that becomes <code>h _ _ h'</code> where the two arguments in between are inferred</p>

<p>(Is discord starting to accumulate this much momentum? I may have to watch it more closely, although it's got a lot of noise on it)</p>

<p>Discord gets people involved but it's (intentionally) very noisy. I tend to tell people that they can feel free to chat/post memes on the Discord but serious lean questions like the above are more likely to be answered quickly on the Zulip</p>

<p>Regarding the meta-question about notation, there is a way to look up notation using <code>#print notation</code> but it won't work in this case because this binder is part of the core syntax, there is no <code>notation</code> command that declares it</p>

<p>Certain pieces of notation are hard for beginners to find; maybe we should make a cheat sheet. What does #notation do?</p>

<p>Nothing :-) So does that mean there can be a website where notation not covered by <code>#print notation</code> can be documented?</p>

<p>I looked it up once (I had to read the source), but it is indeed quite arcane and dissimilar to other lean expressions in a number of ways (like who thought that it would be a good idea to have a binder written <code>(x y, p[x,y])</code>?)</p>
