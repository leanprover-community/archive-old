<p>I want to formalize competitive programming problems in Lean. Think of it as a competitive programming analog of the IMO Grand Challenge, LOL. But I don't really know how to formalize commonly used algorithms and data structures such as BFS, Dijkstra, Floyd–Warshall, sparse tables, segment trees and stuff. Can anyone point me in the right direction?</p>

<p>Of course I can't, that's why I'm asking! Sure I can crib techniques from Haskell when I formalize the implementation but I think proving is more complicated, and I'm pretty sure Haskell is not a verification language by any stretch of the imagination.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, you can just write a program like you would in haskell and as long as it's non-<code>meta</code> you can prove properties about it after the fact in lean</p>

<p>the only thing you have to be careful about while writing the definition is that it is structured such that it "manifestly" terminates</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110025">@Andrew Ashworth</span> Oh neat! From what I've gathered, it looks like no one has attempted to formalize and prove properties about the algorithms and data structures I mentioned in Lean right? So I could consider myself a pioneer, haha. And I don't expect segment trees, sparse tables or even tries to be covered by software foundations as these data structures are specific to competitive programming, which is a pretty niche field.</p>
