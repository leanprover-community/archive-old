<p>I'm working on a proof that requires me to swap the 2nd and 3rd terms in a sum. I tried to do the obvious thing and apply the tactic<br>
x + y + z = x + (y + z)  := by rw [add_assoc]<br>
and I was hoping Lean could get to</p>
<p>_ = x + (z + y) := by rw [add_comm] <br>
but instead it gives (z + y) + x. This makes sense, but what would be the easiest way to get what I am trying to achieve? I feel as if there has to be an easy tactic for this sort of thing but I don't know what it is.</p>
