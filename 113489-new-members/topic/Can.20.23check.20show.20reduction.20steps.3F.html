<p>Working through "Theorem Proving in Lean", currently in section "2.3 Function Abstraction and Evaluation".  <br>
#check is/seems to be doing  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">Lambda Calculus</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Reduction_strategies">reductions</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference">Type inference</a><br>
In learning Lambda Calculus the <code>Lambda calculus reduction workbench</code> (<a href="https://www.itu.dk/people/sestoft/lamreduce/index.html">site</a>) (<a href="https://www.itu.dk/people/sestoft/lamreduce/lamframes.html">app</a>) was helpful in understanding the reductions used.<br>
Does there exist some options for #check or other command that can show the reductions?</p>

<p>I've heard other people talk about using certain "trace" functionalities of Lean for this (in the context of debugging). <br>
I'm not sure if that would show what you expect though, as Lean's underlying calculus does more than just beta-, eta-reduction and alpha-conversion.</p>

<p>To me that actually makes a lot of sense. <br>
Instead of asking lots of questions now, I will take some time to see where that information takes me and perhaps ask more latter.</p>

<p>That is the second time in as many days that I have been directed to that. Still have not read all the way through it, now seems like the right time.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="366057">@Eric Taucher</span> I don't think you need to read all the way through. Sections 2.1-2.5 should give you a good amount of info already.</p>

<p>In an odd way this other <a href="#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/Lean4.20Debugger/near/264159653">topic</a> is also shedding some light, namely <code>set_option</code>. I still have to try it but am reading the paper to the end just to have it imprinted in my memory. Much of it spilling out.</p>
