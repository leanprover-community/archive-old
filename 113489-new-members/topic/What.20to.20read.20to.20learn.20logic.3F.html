<p>The common presentation style of mathematical literature skims over _«nitty-gritty»_ formalities of logic. This is unfortunately reflected in my own lack of understanding — it is often that I trust the proof assistant without really understanding what it does _«under the hood»_, and even if I can prod it into accepting my proof, I am unhappy.</p>
<p>What can I read to better understand how proofs work on the most tedious and pedantic level?</p>
<p>I want to get an intuition of where excluded middle or decidability are required, see examples of how to build natural numbers, functions and tuples from the ground up, how quantifiers work in hypotheses and goals, and so on. Ideally I should like to see how all this works in the setting of Lean, where we have types rather than sets, and why it leads to the same results as the mathematics based on set theory.</p>
<p>I already understand how proofs work overall and I am comfortable working with a proof assistant.</p>

<p>You can read <a href="https://github.com/digama0/lean-type-theory/releases/tag/v1.0">Mario's paper</a> and/or poke around in one of the kernel implementations to see what's at like the ring 0 of Lean. There's also <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226035566_Inductive_families">Peter Dybjer's paper</a> if you really want to get into the theory behind the inductive stuff. At the end of the day, users write an expression <code>e</code> which they claim is of type <code>T</code>, Lean infers the type of <code>e</code> and checks whether the result is definitionally equal to <code>T</code>.</p>

<p>Lean's type theory is equivalent to ZFC + infinitely many universes. The axiom of choice and the law of the excluded middle are proved in core Lean. The axiom of choice is <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/classical.axiom_of_choice">docs#classical.axiom_of_choice</a> and LEM is <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/classical.em">docs#classical.em</a> . You can search for what is in the library using the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/">API documentation</a> and this gives you links to the source code where you can read the proofs.</p>

<p>My understanding so far is that:</p>
<p>Classical ← Constructive → Intuitionistic</p>
<p>For example, in Classical there are discontinuous functions ℝ → ℝ, in Intuitionistic there are none, and Constructive does not care either way. Lean with the core libraries makes the choice to the left, but it seems that Lean without the core libraries is in the middle, either by coincidence or by design.</p>

<p>Whichever way it is, my problem is the lack of skill needed to appreciate all these flavours. For example, we see that Lean with the axiom of choice is equivalent to set theory with axiom of choice. Is Lean without said axiom equivalent to some other flavour of set theory? How do I even begin to investigate this question?</p>

<p>Whichever way it is, my problem is the lack of skill needed to appreciate all these flavours. For example, we see that Lean with the axiom of choice is equivalent to set theory with axiom of choice. Is Lean without said axiom equivalent to some other flavour of set theory? How do I even begin to investigate this question?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think we don't know much about this question. For example I don't think we even really know that core Lean doesn't prove LEM. Here under core Lean I'm including all the fancy parts like definitional proof irrelevance for Prop and large elimination rules.</p>
<p>But presumably the expectation would be that core Lean is comparable to a set theory that's formulated in a constructive first-order logic, such as CZF set theory.</p>

<p>People who care about formalization in a specific constructive framework would presumably rather use a different proof assistant (e.g. Coq) whose relationship to that framework is better understood, so to some extent there's a chicken-and-egg problem</p>

<p>That would be a cool result; unfortunately I don't know much about how to prove e.g. CZF doesn't prove LEM</p>

<p>In response to the original post, this book might be of interest:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Type-Theory-Formal-Proof-Introduction/dp/110703650X">https://www.amazon.com/Type-Theory-Formal-Proof-Introduction/dp/110703650X</a></p>
<p>I've read the first couple of chapters, and I really enjoy it. I find it remarkably clear (thus far).</p>

<p>Unlike some of the mathematicians here, I do care a lot about this stuff. (Maybe that comes from my primarily CS/Philosophy background?) However, I have not had a lot of formal training in the nitty gritty details of complex logic systems like Lean, so I cannot really provide good resources in that regard. My approach in the past has generally be to just roll-my-own by a building a logic from the ground up and seeing what I can prove (and looking up things I stumble upon them). I have learned a lot of what I know now from such explorations.</p>

<p>Realizability models!</p>
<p>But it's finicky.</p>
