<p>The script is almost working. Then we will be able to just write everything in lean and the MD files will be generated automatically.</p>

<p>While reading it, I noticed that it might be nice to have some sort of prelude, that is, a list of pre-requisite items that the reader should familiarize with before being able to fully understand the post. This is taking into consideration the fact that we're targeting inept mathematicians :D</p>
<p>I think it's a bit less scary than finding out strange/new concepts in the middle of the text. And it might as well expose ideas for next posts, with the intent to cover up the prelude topics</p>

<p>When I first saw mention of <code>ourselves as targets</code> it made no sense to me. Now seeing it used in context a few times I take it that it means the goal is not to cover all of Math but only the math in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib">MathLib</a> (Lean 3). Is this the thinking to be associated with that phrase?</p>
<p>This then raises the question if this will cover only <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib">MathLib</a> for Lean 3 and/or <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4">MathLib4</a> for Lean 4?

<p>I think the idea is something like "write for your recent self".  If you've just figured something out (e.g. how some proof works, or what's going on in some particular file in mathlib) then you could write an explanation that summarises your understanding.  The target audience — the person you should imagine you're explaining this to — should be someone of about the same ability as yourself who hasn't just gone through the process of figuring it out.  That is, you should write the article that you wish you could send back in time to your earlier self to save you that effort!</p>

<p>By the way -- I think it's fine to cover something not in mathlib -- it will just mean you get to write the Lean code all on your own.

<p>Yes, I think articles like this will be very valuable as a balance against the mission for maximal generality that guides mathlib.  Naturally, mathlib doesn't want to prove a result specifically for <code>ℕ</code> if it holds for an arbitrary unique factorization monoid; but this tendency toward generalisation means that the statements that get formalised in mathlib can be a bit abstracted and remote from everyday mathematical experience.  It will be really useful, then, to have articles that pull these theorems down to earth and make it easier to understand what they're doing and what they're for.</p>

<p>Also you might start with a smaller example, so the reader can more easily work out the solution for themselves to verify that they understand.  Or even give a worked example like this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we have an alphabet <code>a, b, c</code>, how many multisets of cardinality 2 can we construct?  <br>
First, let's count the multisets that contain <code>a</code>.<br>
If one element of the multiset is <code>a</code> then that leaves us with 3 possibilities for the other element, giving <code>{a,a}</code>, <code>{a,b}</code>, and <code>{a,c}</code>.  <br>
Now we also have to count the multisets that don't contain <code>a</code>.<br>
These are <code>{b,b}</code>, <code>{b,c}</code>, and <code>{c,c}</code>.  So there are 6 in total.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A small worked example like this will help the reader to sniff out the recursive formula for counting multisets.</p>

<p>As in the example above, it might be better to use letters for the alphabet rather than numbers — then we don't have to switch between thinking about numerals that are counting things and numerals that are just symbols in an alphabet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Notice that there is another way to represent each multiset.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an intermediate step, you might point out that each multiset is completely characterised by how many <code>a</code>s it contains, how many <code>b</code>s it contains, etc. — i.e. by a list of numbers.  In particular, the <em>length</em> of the list is the size of the alphabet, and the <em>sum</em> of the list is the cardinality of the multiset.  So every multiset of size <code>k</code> over an alphabet of <code>n</code> symbols corresponds to a way of writing <code>k</code> as a sum of <code>n</code> natural numbers.</p>
<p>From there it's natural (but not obvious!) to move to another representation: we start with <code>k</code> stars and insert bars to partition them into <code>n</code> bins.</p>

<p>I like the use of emoji, but it might be easier to see what's going on if the "bars" were something like <span aria-label="barber" class="emoji emoji-1f488" role="img" title="barber">:barber:</span> rather than <span aria-label="chocolate" class="emoji emoji-1f36b" role="img" title="chocolate">:chocolate:</span>, so it's easier to see them as little dividers inserted between the <span aria-label="star" class="emoji emoji-2b50" role="img" title="star">:star:</span>s.</p>
<p>Also, for some reason I think a sequence like <span aria-label="star" class="emoji emoji-2b50" role="img" title="star">:star:</span><span aria-label="barber" class="emoji emoji-1f488" role="img" title="barber">:barber:</span><span aria-label="barber" class="emoji emoji-1f488" role="img" title="barber">:barber:</span><span aria-label="star" class="emoji emoji-2b50" role="img" title="star">:star:</span><span aria-label="barber" class="emoji emoji-1f488" role="img" title="barber">:barber:</span><span aria-label="star" class="emoji emoji-2b50" role="img" title="star">:star:</span><span aria-label="barber" class="emoji emoji-1f488" role="img" title="barber">:barber:</span> might be easier to comprehend as a first example.  </p>
<p>Somehow this seems easier to think of as "three <span aria-label="star" class="emoji emoji-2b50" role="img" title="star">:star:</span>s with <span aria-label="barber" class="emoji emoji-1f488" role="img" title="barber">:barber:</span>s inserted between them" — but I can't explain why! <span aria-label="upside down" class="emoji emoji-1f643" role="img" title="upside down">:upside_down:</span></p>

<p>Does anyone know how to set a pre-commit git hook? The documentation around this feature is super shallow.</p>

<p>I dunno how exactly git determines what executable to call on windows but I'm rather sure it won't ship it's own thing but instead use the same mechanism windows uses to figure out what to use when you double click something.

<p>It's a part of the emacs plugin <code>org-mode</code> which you can use as basically anything really (and I mean anything, you can generate websites from it, write lecture notes with LaTeX snippets in it, TODO list and time management stuff, table calculation program etc.) and one of its many features is org-babel which basically allows you to write snippets in $LANGUAGE in your document and evaluate them while compiling the document to TeX/HTML/Word/Whatever and print the output into the document.</p>
<p>So theoretically speaking it should be possible to teach org-babel about Lean and due to a feature called sessions also to simply chain multiple lean blocks into one logical program. But I have absolutely not clue how org-babel actually works internally :/</p>

<p>Yeap. Julian proposed something a bit similar: a GH action that pushes a commit to a branch as soon as the branch receives a commit from an user. This approach is a bit annoying because we'd need to pull multiple times while fixing things in the review process.</p>
