<p>I have seen two different syntaxes between declaring parameters <code>def  {A: Type} ... </code> and <code>def  (B: Type) ... </code>. My current understand is that in the former the A parameter is inferred (isn't specified). The later means that B can be inferred with <code>_</code> or have an specified type argument. Is there any other details or documentation for this? Is there a way to specify A in the former case?</p>
