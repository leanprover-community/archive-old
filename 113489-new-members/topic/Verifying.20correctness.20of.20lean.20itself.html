<p>Hi! It's not a direct answer to your question, but there are third-party tools to check lean proofs such as <a href="https://github.com/gebner/trepplein">https://github.com/gebner/trepplein</a></p>

<p>Arguably what you need to trust is:</p>
<ul>
<li>that the proofs that lean can export contain a faithful translation of the original statement (you already have to trust the humans translating math on this)</li>
<li>The proof checker you use to validate the exported proof (which can either be lean itself, or a third-party tool)</li>
</ul>
<p>I would guess the paper about Lean itself can give some insight into this design</p>

<p>I worked a bit with another theorem prover called HOL. They attempted to formally prove correctness of code of HOL with itself. <br>
Is it any interest for similar thing in LEAN?</p>

<p>I believe the correctness proof of HOL was (is?) a huge undertaking. And at the moment Lean is somewhat more popular with mathematicians than computer scientists / logicians, so the interest is probably relatively small.</p>

<p>iirc Leo has mentioned in some talk during the Q&amp;A section that he would welcome if someone would try to do formal verification of the Lean 4 compiler but that it is not of interested  to the compiler development team right now and would be a very non trivial undertaking.</p>
<p>Note that, if you tried to verify correctness of the entire Lean 4 compiler right now in Lean you could not actually do this because it uses features like <code>partial</code> that are impossible to analyze with proofs (on purpose).</p>

<p>It would be a feasible but big project to formalize it</p>

<p>Proving lean's <em>implementation</em> correct is a much bigger project and I don't see it happening in the forseeable future. I've been working on a project along these lines for the past few years (<a href="https://github.com/digama0/mm0">MM0</a>), and a very important part is that it's way simpler than lean, both in theory and in implementation. This is still very uncharted territory, and I would put a bootstrapped verified lean at least 3 years out with a concerted effort by a team of people.</p>
