<p>Hello, everyone. My name is Bulhwi Cha, and I'm an undergraduate in aerospace engineering at Korea Aerospace University. I've been slowly learning "Theorem Proving in Lean 4" with my friends <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="454439">@shimsw20</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="475339">@Minju Kim</span> since the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>I hope to start an EdTech company one day that creates video games and other media for learning STEM subjects. I'm sure proof assistants like Lean and <a href="https://github.com/digama0/mm0">Metamath Zero</a> will play crucial roles in developing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_game">serious games</a> for mathematics education.</p>
<p>But I still have a lot to learn. After I finish "Theorem Proving in Lean 4," I'd like to read "Functional Programming in Lean" and "Metaprogramming in Lean 4." Perhaps I could start a small project such as <a href="https://github.com/marcusrossel/lean-snakebird">lean-snakebird</a> by then.</p>
<p>I think the future for Lean and formal mathematics is bright!</p>
