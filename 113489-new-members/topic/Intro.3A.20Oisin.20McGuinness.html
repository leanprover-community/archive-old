<p>Hi, I've recently un-lurked in other threads, so thought I should introduce myself properly!</p>
<p>My name is Oisin McGuinness, located in NYC, and I'm interested in elliptic curves,  computational number theory, arithmetical algebraic geometry and related (e.g formal groups). Recently retired from a long-term financial sector job (mostly systems admin, security and systems programming in a variety of languages) and wanting to get involved in Lean and mathlib/mathlib4.</p>
