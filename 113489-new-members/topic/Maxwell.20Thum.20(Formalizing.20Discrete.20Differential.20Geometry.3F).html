<p>Hi everyone,<br>
My name is Maxwell and I'm in my senior year of undergrad for math. I'm thinking of formalizing some discrete differential geometry (<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/DDG/">https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/DDG/</a>) in Lean as part of my senior thesis. For instance, I'm imagining defining things like combinatorial surfaces, abstract simplicial complexes (it looks like <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="388925">@Floris Cnossen</span>  has already formalized simplicial sets), and discrete differential forms.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, nobody has done any DDG in Matlib or Lean. I have not learned any Lean yet, so I'm not sure exactly what I would be getting into. Does this sound at all feasible?  Would this contribution be welcome?</p>

<p>I have no idea what discrete differential geometry is; I always think of combinatorial surfaces and simplicial complexes as algebraic topology and I don't know what a discrete differential form is but maybe I can guess. All of this sounds very doable in lean though.</p>

<p>Maybe, but it doesn't seem like something I would do in this project. (I'm also fairly new to DDG, so I think I'll also be learning the subject by formalizing it; pardon my ignorance)</p>

<p>I think a good start would be for you to decide what are you really interested in.</p>
<p>Do you want to properly prove stuff and make a contribution to mathlib? Or are you ok doing more computational stuff that might not be fully formalized and probably make a contribution to my library?</p>
<p>Whare to start? I think the main question is on top of what to build the (co)chain complex. Use simplicial complex, simplicial set or some combinatorial surface?</p>

<p>But I think that is unnecessarily complicated. As you have mentioned that you are fairly new to Lean and DDG, I think the best thing would be to write down some simple structure representing closed(no boundary) triangular surfaces and work with that.</p>

<p>I would check what is already in mathlib. I'm not very familiar with it so input from someone more familiar with it, in particular algebraic topology, what would be nice. </p>
<p>What you need is the corresponding chain complex for a given simplicial complex or semi-simplicial set, and it should be a complex of real vector spaces. </p>
<p>To define discrete differential forms you just take the dual complex and you get "Stokes theorem" immediately from the definition of coboundary.</p>
<p>To get Laplacian, you need to define the dual cochain complex and the map(Hodge star) between the original(called primal) cochain complex and the dual cochain complex. There are few things necessary:</p>
<ol>
<li>Usually you do this only for closed triangular surfaces, such a subset of simplicial complexes needs to be defined.</li>
<li>You need distance information on your original simplicial complex, either vertex embeddings or edge lengths.</li>
<li>If I remember correctly, the Hodge star is just a diagonal matrix with ratios of primal and dual cells sizes. For example you will need to know all the neighbouring triangles of a vertex.</li>
</ol>

<p>One neat thing would be to show that the discrete differential/coboundary is not doing any approximation.</p>
<p>First establish the connection 'differential form -&gt; discrete differential form'. </p>
<p>Take a manifold and draw triangulation on it(probably quite hard to formalize). Discrete differential form is just a cochain i.e. map from a chain to a number. So for a differential form <code>w</code> the corresponding discrete differential form is the map taking a chain and integrating <code>w</code> over it.<br>
The fact that the two paths:</p>
<ol>
<li>differential form -&gt; apply differential -&gt; map to discrete differential form</li>
<li>differential form -&gt; map to discrete differential form -&gt; apply discrete differential</li>
</ol>
<p>give the same answer falls "almost" immediately out of the definition. You need to use normal Stokes theorem, that is why "almost".</p>

<p>The discrete Hodge star is just an approximation to the smooth counter part and honestly I have very little idea how to make the connection precise. Maybe through finite element method, Whitney forms, ... definitely beyond an undergrad project.</p>

<p>Euler's formula in full generality pertains to algebraic topology. For polyhedra, there are simplifications (because your paths are nicely behaved), but that's still far from what I would deem "a nice first project".</p>

<p>I suggested in <a href="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/convex.20polytopes">a previous discussion</a> that Platonic solids might be considered a special case of classifying regular polytopes (not necessarily convex) in any Euclidean dimension, and that it might (in line with usual mathlib principles of generality) be appropriate to set up definitions for abstract polytopes before working on flag-transitive realizations thereof in Euclidean space. It seems Yaël has <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/polytopes">branch#polytopes</a> for abstract polytopes but I don't know its status. And this may well be one of the cases where there's a choice between doing something for a specific case in the mathlib archive and checking the entry off the 100-theorems list, or doing the larger project to get the general definitions and results into mathlib proper.</p>
