<p>Hello everyone. I'm coming from a programming background and I find this formal verification stuff super interesting. Would love to learn more about lean, but I have a few questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What's the deal with lean 3 vs 4? I'm currently using lean 4, but it looks like most resources are targeted towards lean 3. Though it looks like lean 3 was last updated back in 2019, so should a beginner like me focus on learning lean 3 or 4?</li>
<li>I've stumbled across numerous introduction guides to lean, but is there any more structured documentation on features and syntax of the language? Or am I supposed to figure stuff out by reading the source code?</li>
</ul>

<p>You should be using the community edition of lean 3, at <a href="http://leanprover-community.github.io">leanprover-community.github.io</a></p>

<p>Lean 3 is forked, and alive and well at the Leanprover community website. Sounds like you might want to look at the community <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/">home page</a> to get up to speed with what's happening with Lean 3.</p>

<p>Alright, didn't see it was forked. What's the status of lean 4? How usable is it? And is there any estimation when it will be "ready"? I quite like the fact that large parts of it are written in lean, and reading about the changes from lean 3 to 4, many of them sound quite handy.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="429227">@DayDun</span> It's perfectly usable, but it is currently undergoing rapid development and changes by the day. The <em>very</em> work-in-progress Lean 4 manual has a <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/setup.html">section</a> on how to set it up. Currently, despite the existence of a supposed stable release, the nightly is the only version actively supported (e.g., by the VSCode extension and <a class="stream" data-stream-id="270676" href="/#narrow/stream/270676-lean4">#lean4</a>  stream).  So, if you are fine playing with an alpha product you can jump in and toy around with stuff if you want. However, if you want a stable Lean with some rich documentation, the Lean 3 community version is for you.</p>
