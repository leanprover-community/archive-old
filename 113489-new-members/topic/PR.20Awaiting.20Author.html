<p>My PR, <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/11168">#11168</a>, was tagged as "awaiting author" a while ago and I'm not sure why. It seems to me like I addressed all the issues in people's comments and the PR passed all checks when they were performed. Can anybody see what the problem is? </p>
<p>I also added the "awaiting review" label on the PR in case someone could answer on GitHub, but I thought I might as well ask here too.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="460212">@Sebastian Monnet</span> It seems that I added the label 29 days ago. Since then a lot has happened on that PR. If you feel that you done everything you should, please remove the label again!</p>

<p>That way we can easily see where there is still ongoing conversation.</p>

<p>Of course, it'll probably fail checks now, after all this time:(</p>
