<p>Hi Everyone, </p>
<p>Very very excited to be here. I learned about Lean from a video by Quanta Magazine featuring Prof. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> . I got hooked immediately, and totally share the passion.<br>
I'm currently teaching myself undergrad level pure mathematics, and of course I want to master the materials as quickly and thoroughly as possible just like everyone else here, and if I can use Lean to do exercises, that'll be perfect.</p>
<p>I don't know if this question got asked before, but going around in lean community I couldn't find a clear path from beginner to advanced, or from freshman to senior, of getting through all the materials for a standard 4-year undergrad math major.</p>
<p>I know there are a few <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html">textbook-like introductions</a> on the community GitHub site, and  a <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad.html">list</a> in mathlib, but they are not what I am looking for.<br>
MIT's website has a <a href="https://math.mit.edu/academics/undergrad/roadmaps.php">good example</a>. Here is a piece from their roadmap:</p>
<p><strong>Analysis &amp; Geometry</strong><br>
Tier 1:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>- 18.100B Intro to Real Analysis
- 18.700 Linear Algebra/18.701 Algebra I
</code></pre></div>

<p>Tier 2:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>- 18.101 Analysis and Manifolds,
- 18.102 Introduction to Functional Analysis,
- 18.103, 18.104, 18.112, 18.152, 18.950, 18.994 ...
</code></pre></div>

<p>Tier 3:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>- 18.125 Measure Theory and Analysis,
- 18.155 Differential Analysis I,
- 18.156, 18.952, 18.965, 18.966 ...
</code></pre></div>

<p>I am not studying with an advisor (maybe I should), and a good road map like this is how I make sure I cover all the materials I should. A clear way of integrating Lean into this road map is absolutely necessary for me, so that I don't have to spend too much time wondering which part of mathlib will be a good fit to do exercise with for the books I'm reading.<br>
I know that I'm not a typical math student, but I guess not a lot of math students have advisors who know how to hand pick examples and exercises from mathlib either, so perhaps actually my need is more general than one person?</p>
<p>When I first discovered lean, I was so excited, that I did nothing else but Lean for a week (well, that's a lie, I was also spending quite a bit of time setting up lean.vim or lean.nvim, with help from <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="321696">Julian Berman</span> . But then I realized that I was falling behind on my study schedule, and I have to pause leaning a bit.<br>
I would love to use Lean more if I don't need to slow down my study pace, and I'd love to hear what fellow math students, especially those in ICL (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110064">@Kenny Lau</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110044">@Chris Hughes</span> , <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="120256">@Ali Sever</span>   ... ), have to say about their experience. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks a ton!<br>
A.D.</p>

<p>Thank you for such a quick response! I came across your workshop this morning and I am going to look into it more. It seems to me a great way to learn lean when one already understands the associated math, and I'm seeing if there's a way to do it in the other direction: learn basic lean and then learn "standard" mathematics by reading textbooks and doing corresponding lean exercises. With so many undergrad topics already in mathlib, this should be possible. </p>
<p>I'm also interested in a bit more detail how your students go through their mathematics curriculum, and how heavily is lean involved in their education. Is it a standalone project of fomalising already learned math, or is it a more integrated daily tool, like sage or matlab? If this is documented in your Xena project, I'm sorry I didn't locate it.</p>

<p>This was a course for PhD students who knew the maths already. They had no lean background but by the end of it those who needed grades were able to make mathematical objects and prove theorems about them</p>

Why do you think it would be unwise to teach extensively using lean, the reason may already be covered in the video, could you put it in one or two sentences? That would really help me understand how I should use it.</p>

<p>I started off on this whole Lean thing thinking that it would be a great tool to teach weak undergraduates how to keep their quantifiers in order and to think carefully about the definition of a limit. But all I managed to do was to attract the smart kids who could do that stuff already and were intrigued by the program.</p>

<p>But if that's the case, that people don't use lean to learn basic stuff, but only on familiar stuff, why would mathematician use lean on things they don't understand yet, i.e. research, dosen't that require them to spend a lot of time setting NEW objects in lean first, which may not exist, because nobody has worked on them yet?</p>

<p>I'm totally out of my depth now, in your experience, does lean help speed up research compared to pen and paper, or even ipad? I heard Voevodsky saying that 90% of mathematians' time is in checking his proof is correct. In your experience, is that how lean help you and your students save their time in research, by eliminating the need to ensure rigor step by step?</p>

<p>No, it is much much longer to formalize a proof than to be sure the proof is right. Mathematicians are pretty good at producing correct proofs, and don't need proof assistants for that.</p>

<p>That's why i'm interested too!<br>
but does that mean cutting down formalizing time is the most critical in eventually using it for research?<br>
what i'm trying to ask is, let's say 50 years from now, AI isn't able automatically do math research yet, but every mathematician is using a proof assistant, what would be the reason to motivate them to use the assistant?</p>

<p>I said <code>mathlib</code> specifically because mathlib forbids waving things away using <code>sorry</code>. Why does addition and multiplication work the way they do? That's not explained at full rigor at any school education until you get to real analysis. The really nice "proof" of Pythagoras's theorem via the image of triangles and a square is great. But to formalize it rigorously is not something mathlib has done yet. mathlib does not have cycle notation for permutations. mathlib does not have row reduced echelon form for matrices. mathlib doesn't have a rigorous way of writing out the "carry-by-one digit-wise multiplication" that is taught in elementary mathematics. This isn't to say that mathlib shouldn't have these things! But that these elementary results are often either not "rigorous" or are such specializations that mathlib has encoded the general result in a way that might not be accessible.</p>

<p>Has anyone worked on formalizing famous textbooks or their exercises? Obviously there will be copyright problems, but building a library of exercise with solutions would greatly help people like me to use Lean for studying.<br>
If no one is doing that, I may try formalizing a few (if the copyright stuff works out), when time allows.<br>
Would this be a valuable contribution?</p>

<p>Actually I'm doing a mixture of both. Students have a calculus course during their first term. They see the actual definitions of limits, continuous functions, derivatives (in an elementary context of course), and they see proofs during lectures (up to the intermediate value theorem, mean value theorem, stuff like that). But during exercises sessions they don't have to prove anything, they simply computes limits, derivatives, integrals. Then in my course I cover no new theorem, but they have to actually prove stuff, using epsilons and deltas.</p>

<p>Nobody uses Bourbaki to teach. Bourbaki serves a different purpose, namely to show that mathematics really can be built up rigourously from the axioms. Stuff is sometimes done in a totally different order to the way you would teach it, and sometimes in a far more general way than one would teach it. Books tend not to take that approach. Lean on the other hand does take that approach. Hence formalising a book designed for teaching might not be the right thing to do somehow.</p>
