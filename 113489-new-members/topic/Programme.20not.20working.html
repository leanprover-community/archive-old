<p>Hi, sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this, but is there any chance of some help getting lean working?  I followed the instructions on my personal laptop, and it all worked fine.  Then I tried it on my office computer, and it works less well.  It's not a complete failure, but as good as.  To test, I'm in mathematics_in_lean going through welcome.lean.  When I "try it", it prints Hello World and 2+ 2 : N,  f: N -&gt; N for the checking in the next one. Then I get to the third grey box with a "try it" option. It has to import something.  First it says it is loading for a rather long time. Then after a few minutes it gives me lots of error messages like this: </p>
<p>Error updating: excessive memory consumption detected at 'expression traversal' (potential solution: increase memory consumption threshold).</p>
<p>Any help much appreciated. Mark</p>

<p>Are you talking about using this book in a web browser or did you install Lean on your computer?</p>

<p>Things should work in seconds, not fail in minutes.</p>
