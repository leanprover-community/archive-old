<p>Sorry to post this here. From the main zulipchat page, I search for "affine" (without the quotation marks). This used to return a bunch of pages. I'm looking in particular for a comment I saw recently about formalizing calculus in affine rather than linear spaces. But this search now returns only two threads. I'm probably doing something completely moronic. Anyone notice anything different in the last few days?</p>

<p>Are you on mobile? In my experience, the web version allows me to search through the entirety of the zulip chat history, while the mobile app will not let me do this, though there probably is a way</p>

<p>Maybe <a href="#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/Some.20olympiad.20formalisations/near/195622504" title="#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/Some.20olympiad.20formalisations/near/195622504">this comment</a> is the one you're looking for? I was able to find it by searching for "calculus", but it doesn't show up when I search for "affine" (on desktop).</p>

<p>Also, I think this thread is fine here, but note that we also have a <a href="#narrow/stream/236604-Zulip-meta" title="#narrow/stream/236604-Zulip-meta">Zulip meta</a> stream.</p>
