<p>hi i'm interested in learning lean and potentially contributing &amp; using it to further automate theorem proving. i hope i was not too blunt to go straight to the general channel before making this introduction to talk about dreamcoder. but i am seriously stoked about that paper, as it combines a lot of important pieces together imho. i'm just an undergrad (graduated already), and my strengths are algorithms and reinforcement learning.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="405058">@mikey liu</span>, welcome! There is a specific stream for <a class="stream" data-stream-id="219941" href="/#narrow/stream/219941-Machine-Learning-for-Theorem-Proving">#Machine Learning for Theorem Proving</a>, if you haven't seen it already, I think you have to subscribe separately. But that seems the most appropriate place to discuss the applications of this paper to Lean/ATP.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t think I have permission to do so but I would be happy to have the current discussion (<a class="stream" data-stream-id="113488" href="/#narrow/stream/113488-general">#general</a> dreamcoder) moved to <a class="stream" data-stream-id="219941" href="/#narrow/stream/219941-Machine-Learning-for-Theorem-Proving">#Machine Learning for Theorem Proving</a>.  But regardless of where it is discussed, welcome <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="405058">@mikey liu</span>, and I for one am always happy to discuss more about Lean, RL, and program synthesis. <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>

<p>Also, you should check out the <a class="stream" data-stream-id="274007" href="/#narrow/stream/274007-lean-gptf">#lean-gptf</a> channel as well.</p>
