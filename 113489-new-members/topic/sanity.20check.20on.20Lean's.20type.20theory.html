<p>I've been lightly reading through some things, such as <a href="https://github.com/digama0/lean-type-theory/releases/tag/v1.0">Mario Carneiro's thesis</a> and <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-intuitionistic">the SEP entry on intuitionistic type theory</a>. I just want to do a sanity check. Are the following correct?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We use the term <em>predicative</em> vs <em>impredicative</em> to refer to whether a definition is allowed to reference itself. For Lean, terms are predicative, all types are predicative, except <code>Prop</code> which is impredicative: terms are predicative in the sense that, (without the <code>meta</code> keyword) I can't write a definition of a function <code>f</code> whose body calls <code>f</code> itself. On the other hand <code>Prop</code> is impredicative, in the sense that I can have a type <code>\Pi P:Prop, P : Prop</code> where a term of type <code>Prop</code> itself contains the type Prop. Other types are predicative, in the sense that if <code>\Pi T: Type u, T</code> will have type <code>Type u+1</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need that terms are predicative in order to ensure that the type theory is consistent, but Prop being impredicative only means that the type theory becomes undecidable in general, it doesn't result in inconsistency (as far as we know). I'm unsure about this.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Not quite. A definition that references itself is called "recursive", and this is well known since antiquity to lead to contradictions without constraint, c.f. the liar paradox. Impredicativity refers to a definition that is allowed to quantify over a type or collection that <em>contains</em> the object being defined. This leads more subtly to contradiction via Russell's paradox, and different constraints are required to eliminate the contradictions</p>

<p>Using impredicativity in lean you can create russell-like properties like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">russell</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Prop</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="bp">∃</span> <span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Prop</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="kt">Prop</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="bp">¬</span> <span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="bp">∃</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">p</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">)</span>

<p>So this property doesn't introduce an inconsistency, it just is a property for which we can neither prove it nor disprove it. i.e. we can neither have an inhabitant of <code>russel</code> nor of <code>¬ russel</code>?</p>

<p>Note that "impredicative" in this context has nothing to do with "impredicative types" in Haskell, which is about type inference on nested foralls.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="284606">@Chris M</span> No, that <code>russell</code> can certainly be proven or disproven. It's not really possible to faithfully represent russell's class inside prop because Prop -&gt; Prop doesn't inject into Prop; <code>Exists</code> , playing the role of <code>subtype</code> inside <code>Prop</code>, is not an injective function (and if it was, Russell's class would yield a contradiction)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="294142">@Chris Wong</span> Actually I think the usage is related. Haskell is based on System F, in which there is one universe called <code>*</code> which is impredicative (you can quantify over types and get another type).  However type inference works with only a subset of these types, where all type quantifiers appear at the top level. These are called "rank 1" types, and if you use haskell without <code>ImpredicativeTypes</code>, the universe is not fully impredicative, because types with quantifiers don't act like true types since they can't be used on the left of an arrow. The universe is basically first order at that point and so you don't get impredicative quantification.</p>
