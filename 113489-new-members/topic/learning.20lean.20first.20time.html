<p>I have never worked with a dependently typed language before, but I do have experience with f#. would it be hard to learn lean?</p>

<p>Lean will most definitely feel quite different from F# but you will probably have an easier time than say a person who only knows java and python since F# has quite few functional concepts and constructs you won't see in those languages but all the time in lean (e.g. tagged union types, lots of recursion, pattern matching etc).</p>

<p>Hm, I think it depends on what you consider "hard". I had never worked with a dependently typed language or anything like F# before and I could say it's being "hard" for me. But since I enjoy the challenge (and the elegance of Lean), it's actually being "emotionally easy", so to speak... in the sense that I feel very motivated</p>

<p>I found most of the language  relatively easy to learn but that is most likely because I already had experience with Isabelle/HOL and Haskell so I had to adjust rather small parts of my mental model to fit with Lean.</p>

<p>I'd say if you have never worked in a dependently typed language before you can already go ahead and start learning with Lean 4, it takes a time to get used to and the final (semi automatic) full port of mathlib to Lean 4 will also happen in the not so distant future, maybe by the time you know all the basics it will already have happened^^</p>

<p>From what I've noticed (and I'm a newbie here), there is quite a lot more involved in the creation of Lean 4 than the mere workaround of bugs. The whole infrastructure is much superior, more generic and more powerful. We have a server that implements LSP, we have an FFI, we have a cleaner syntax.</p>
<p>And I'm certain that it's still just the tip of the iceberg</p>

<p>I don't think writing such sentences helps at all. You should compare such a meaningless sentence to what is written in Section 8 of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05647">https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05647</a> for instance. There you'll see very specific benchmark presented in a very careful way, explaining why results should be interpreted with caution.</p>

<p>By the way, in case you weren't aware <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="270523">@Huỳnh Trần Khanh</span> , that screenful of random errors (which everyone has probably seen before) is a symptom of memory exhaustion. When the memory allocator starts to say "no" to things, almost every activity lean tries to do will fail, but because it is a resilient program it keeps going and throwing more errors. It is unlikely that lean 4 changes this, memory exhaustion is an extremely difficult situation to recover from</p>

<p>That's also why restarting lean usually fixes the issue, because it frees everything and starts over. It is unclear whether this is even fixable; if there is a memory leak then this would be the usual way users will encounter it but that implication goes only one way - you can also genuinely run out of memory, and if for example you have (accidentally or otherwise) attempted to compile all of mathlib in RAM that might be a significant possibility.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="270523">@Huỳnh Trần Khanh</span> I was under the impression that a reason Lean 4 has new code isn't because the Lean 3 code base is somehow unmaintainable, but rather one of the goals of the project is self-hosting: Lean 4 is designed to be capable of writing Lean 4 in Lean 4.</p>

<p>isn't self hosting a rite of passage for programming languages? a self hosted compiler is a great indicator of a language's maturity right? that is, if the Lean compiler, a big, nontrivial application can be written in Lean itself that it means Lean is mature enough to tackle real life applications?</p>

<p>I don't see that link very clearly, but it definitely displays a certain level of maturity. And I also find it extra helpful because we can learn a lot about Lean 4 just from reading Lean 4 source code</p>
