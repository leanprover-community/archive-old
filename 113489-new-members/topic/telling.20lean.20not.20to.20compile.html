<p>Hi! Is there some easy way to tell lean not to compile the code from some line onwards? Or to ignore all proofs except the one i am working on? <br>
I tried to use commenting the rest of the code, but since its full of comment blocks i would have to do it on a lot of places, which is annoying... Cheers, Jachym</p>

<p>You can write <code>#exit</code> and lean will ignore everything that comes after it</p>

<p>You can use <code>#exit</code> on the line you want Lean to stop trying on, or alternatively in VSCode you can set Lean to only check visible lines</p>

<p>Also, if you use VScode, you can select a bunch of code and hit <code>Ctrl</code>-<code>/</code>, and it will (un)comment the entire selection.</p>

<p>If you don't use VScode, then you are using an editor that also has this feature, but I don't know how tell butterfly this intended effect.</p>

<p>Awsome, thanks!</p>
<p>I am using vscode, but the shortcut doesnt work. But the <code>#exit</code> thing is perfect</p>

<p>If I am switching between branches and want to change a bunch of olean files, I used to switch the check to "checking nothing", do command line leanproject stuff and then switch back and restart Lean -- I had had issues with Lean getting super-confused about olean files randomly changing and then filling up memory compiling stuff when things were in a temporary broken state. Now I tend to just exit VS Code and then restart it though.</p>

<p>I think I use it in emacs but just because it is the default (or perhaps I thought it sounded like a good idea long ago)</p>
