<p>Hi everyone. My name is Kevin Allen and I am an MSc Maths student in University College Dublin (soon to be PhD student). I have recently been looking into Lean out of curiosity after watching a couple of Kevin Buzzard's videos on youtube, and I completed the Natural Number Game and the further Maths Challenges on the github page.<br>
I am currently doing my MSc project on topics in finite geometry (projective planes, semifields etc.) and was thinking I could introduce some Lean to help learn Lean and the project material. I had a look through the library and couldn't find a definition of a projective plane so that could possibly be a start for me. Would anyone have advice for how to get started? Much appreciated!</p>

<p>There are some old threads related to axiomatic geometry linked <a href="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Euclidean.20geometry.20in.20mathlib.3F/near/189423917">here</a>; see also <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="241485">@Vaibhav Karve</span>'s <a href="https://vaibhavkarve.github.io/leanteach_2020.html">work on axiomatic geometry in Lean</a>.</p>

<p>I also have a branch where I started some sketches about projective geometry (with the eventual goal of proving the fundamental theorem of projective geometry), but I haven't had the time nor energy to work on it for a while... I think it's <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/proj-space-quot">branch#proj-space-quot</a> ?</p>
<p>(This has nothing about the axiomatic approach though)</p>

<p>Brilliant. Thanks for the resources. I am still quite new to github so I will have some fun figuring that out too</p>

<p>We have <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/index.html">a page</a> for new mathlib contributors, but also feel free to ask any questions about git or github here!</p>
