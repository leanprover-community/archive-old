<p>I am completely new to Lean, and I want to learn it and how to use the mathlib library.<br>
I do have some experience in type theory and proof checking languages (specifically, I have used Agda).<br>
I came from the Natural Numbers game, so I have a feeling about whats going on in Lean, but using the whole library from scratch is pretty daunting to me.<br>
I have read the "first proofs" doc in the mathlib tutorial, but I wouldn't say I could reproduce these proofs without it.<br>
Where can I start? I would prefer a place that builds from (a bit above) zero and has as many exercises as possible.</p>

<p>I'll try it, thank you.</p>
