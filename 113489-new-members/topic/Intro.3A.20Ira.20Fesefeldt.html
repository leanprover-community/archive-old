<p>Heya! I saw that this stream is used to introduce myself. Well, my name is Ira and I am a phd student mostly interested in program verification, especially of probabilistic programs also featuring concurrency and heap-manipulation, for which I want to use lean. Fortunately I already found the program verification stream, which will probably soon be confronted with my (maybe naive) questions.</p>
