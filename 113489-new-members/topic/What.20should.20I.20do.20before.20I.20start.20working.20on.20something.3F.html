<p>Hi all,<br>
We are a group of undergraduate students in a research project. We would like to try to formalize Cauchy's Interlacing Theorem into lean code. Is there any recommended step to take before actually doing that? (like issue PR etc.? idk) <br>
Thanks!</p>

<p>Do you have a detailed proof that you would like to follow? I think most of the basic prerequisites are available in mathlib. So this seems like a suitable project to get started on.</p>

<p>We have finished natural number game as well as most of the tutorials on webpage. Currently we are reading Theorem Proving in Lean and Types and Programming Languages, while trying to experiment with mathilb.</p>

<p>oh that sounds great but I'm confused by the "like issue PR etc." part... do you want to contribute to mathlib? or do you want to start a new project?</p>

<p>I mean if you just want to start your own project then I don't think you need any prerequisites aside from a working Lean installation...</p>

<p>Sorry for causing misunderstanding :) yes, we would love to contribute to mathlib if condition permits ... I was just wondering if there is any need to share working progress on certain project so to prevent we work on something others have already close to finish ...</p>
