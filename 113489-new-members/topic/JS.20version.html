<p>Pardon the noob question, and I realize the JS version might really be no more than a gimmick for the community here, but I am trying to use it to verify student high school algebra work. Both <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-web-editor">https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-web-editor</a> and <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/live/latest/">https://leanprover.github.io/live/latest/</a> are driven by some complicated webasm loader mechanism - and then some, I mean 60KLOC of JavaScript for an editor page without the editor? - , is there a "how-to" for that anywhere? </p>
<p>I also had hopes for <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean.js">https://github.com/leanprover/lean.js</a>, and can indeed get that to work, but it hasn't been updated in 5 years and doesn't recognize things like linarith (and possibly all things mathlib). Any pointers would be appreciated! Thanks!</p>

<p>The github repo for the community web editor is here: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-web-editor">https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-web-editor</a></p>
<p>The README has some info on getting set up, but if you have any questions, feel free to ask here.</p>

<p>I took the liberty of following the tracks and came across this on your repo: <a href="https://github.com/bryangingechen/lean-client-js/blob/cache/lean-client-js-browser/demo.ts">https://github.com/bryangingechen/lean-client-js/blob/cache/lean-client-js-browser/demo.ts</a>. Worth following as a template?</p>

<p>Sure, depending on what you want to do. Note that the main repo is here (I don't think there are any differences with my fork atm): <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean-client-js">https://github.com/leanprover/lean-client-js</a></p>
<p>Some projects that use lean-client-js outside of the community web editor are <a href="https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/">the natural number game</a> (powered by the <a href="https://github.com/mpedramfar/Lean-game-maker">lean-game-maker</a>) and some <a href="https://observablehq.com/collection/@bryangingechen/lean">old Observable notebooks I made</a> (I should check if they still work...).</p>

<p>Ah thanks! I got to your repo because that is where <a href="http://fetch_lean_js.sh">fetch_lean_js.sh</a> (exact name?) gets its files.</p>

<p>Yeah, for historical reasons we've been using my GitHub pages storage as a webhost. I was figuring out how JS + the web worked as I was hacking on it, so you may notice lots of other weird quirks. Suggestions / PRs welcome!</p>

<p>Got that to work. Thanks for your help!</p>
