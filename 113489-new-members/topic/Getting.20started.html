<p>Hi, how do I get started with lean? There is plenty of documentation, but it seems to need some bootstrapping. E.g. simple things like building instructions seem to point to the download page which points to the github with points to the download page :O</p>

<p>No, <code>irreducible</code> is just a hint to Lean to say "please don't unfold this definition" (<code>sorry</code> is used to omit a proof of something - it is not used in mathlib)</p>

The audio is low, but it's really clear and explains things that I didn't see clearly explained in the docs. Even simple things like what the := means, are not clear and kind of hidden in the doc.</p>

<p>@Golol, Lean is a functional programming language (rather like Haskell), which has a dependent type theory (like Coq, and Agda) which is sufficiently expressive that you can "do most maths" in it in a fairly natural way. You can write proofs either in "term mode" (like programming) or in "tactic mode" (more like a declarative script telling Lean how to manipulate the proof goals). It is being actively developed (Lean 4 is coming along, and the mathematical library, mathlib, is being worked on by lots of people here).</p>

<p>The other advantage of the instructions is that they give you a pre-compiled copy of mathlib. You can of course compile mathlib yourself once you have Lean up and running, but it's about 100 minutes (single core), so usually preferable to avoid doing yourself.</p>

<p>Hello. Windows user here.</p>
<p>I've gotten Lean up and running already with VS Code. Because I had no idea ahead of time that the plugin would offer to install Lean itself, rather than letting the plugin install <code>elan</code>, I got the binaries ahead of time and pointed the plugin at it instead. So that is all fine and good.</p>
<p>However, I am having difficulty figuring out how to install the Lean mathlib. Yes, I know that there are install instructions here: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/install/windows.md" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/install/windows.md">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/install/windows.md</a>. However, I am reluctant to go all the way with them for the following reasons.</p>
<p>All the installation instructions are essentially messing around with a Linux shell that I am not familiar with. I am somewhat familiar with the Windows Powershell, but now with the Bash shell and I have no idea what most of these commands do.</p>
<p>To show why this is an issue...suppose I open that Git Bash shell and run <code>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kha/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh</code>. Will this install <code>elan</code> somewhere even though I already have Lean installed? If I do not do this, will it break one of the future steps?</p>
<p>Then the instructions say to install Python. I already have several Python 3 versions in my system (such as from Visual Studio's Anaconda install), and do not want to add any more to PATH. Right now the one that I have in PATH is 2.7 which is linked to Emacs. If I change that to 3.7 will it break the Emacs installation?</p>
<p>At any rate, what I wrote is moot as running <code>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover-community/mathlib-tools/master/scripts/remote-install-update-mathlib.sh -sSf | bash</code> which I anticipate should get the compiled library and put it I-do-not-know-where fails. Even if I put one of the Python 3 version into PATH, it fails to detect it from the shell, offers to install it and when I agree runs into issues with Chocolatey (which is kind of like <code>apt-get</code> for Windows) and aborts after too many errors. At first it asks me to go into administrator mode, but fails from there too with a huge pileup of text. I could paste it here, but I do not think that would get us anywhere constructive.</p>
<p>I'd like to have some clear instruction on how to install the library starting with cloning the repo and moving from there. I hate the Linux style of installation where I am forced to mess with configuration files by hand and playing around with weird commands. Every time I tried something like that it has been an incredible waste of time to get the tools to work as it is now.</p>
<p>I already tried just separating the folders inside <code>src</code> from the rest and putting them into the <code>LEAN_PATH</code> environment variable, but that is not working for me even though it seems them in autocomplete. It keeps looking for the <code>init</code> file and there are some errors with line endings apparently.</p>
<p>What should I do here?</p>

<p>Why not just try installing Lean and mathlib following the instructions on the mathlib page (the thing you don't want to do) and just optimistically hope that it doesn't break anything which you've already set up? I'm sure that we would be keen to hear about any breakage (and would fix the scripts if possible). You don't have to understand the command line incantations, you just have to do what you're told. You do this every time you click "install this thing" on Windows and it replies "sure, type in your admin password and I'll sort it out". Surely every time you install some other software on Windows you don't ask exactly what it is doing? You will have to engage with the command line here, every time you clone a lean project from github you will have to type some incantations on the command line to make the project download the correct version of mathlib and then download all the binary mathlib files which mean you don't have to spend 15 minutes with your CPU on 100% while it compiles. An uncompiled mathlib is very painful. You don't just "download mathlib", that's not how it works. You work on a project, and the project has its own mathlib, and this mathlib needs to be compiled or it is painful. That's what all the magic incantations will make easy.</p>

<p>If you don't want to fiddle with configuration stuff, then Kevin's suggestion of just starting from scratch using the mathlib install instructions are the right idea. Issues always come up due to system configuration when you try to "save time" by using what you already have instead of what the scripts are expecting. You <em>can</em> go this route but in that case I wouldn't use any of the scripts, I would use the underlying commands</p>

<p>While we're here, can we point new users to <em>any</em> example of a simple project (i.e. not the perfectoid project) with mathlib as a dependency (i.e. not mathlib) and clear installation instructions? Is there one kicking around somewhere?</p>

<p>For some reason the shell is not recognizing the <code>update-mathlib</code> command. But though it took it a while to do what it needs to under the hood in order to go through with the import, the test fragment seems to be working.</p>

<p>Yup. <code>update-mathlib</code> is a custom script installed by the incantations that you ignore, which takes a project, looks at which version of mathlib it compiles with, and then fetches precompiled binaries from a stash in the cloud and downloads them and puts them in the right place. Saves you 15 minutes of 100% CPU hammering.</p>

<p>It's not harder to install, you can compile the project yourself without update-mathlib, just make sure your device is plugged into the mains and you have something else to do for 30 minutes, and every time the maintainers decide to bump the version of mathlib you'll have the same problem.</p>

<p>Oh -- you did the incantations? Then it should work. Compiling the library is painful because it is a large amount of Lean code and it's got to the point where it's painful. There are some short proofs that take 20 seconds to compile because mathlib pushes Lean's type class resolution system to its limits.</p>

<p>Very short Lean files can force the kernel to deal with absolutely gigantic terms, because mathematics is good at bundling stuff like fields up into neat packages but Lean has to deal with what's actually going on.</p>

<p>What is the output of <code>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover-community/mathlib-tools/master/scripts/remote-install-update-mathlib.sh -sSf | bash</code> ? That's surely the line that installs update-mathlib :D</p>

<p>The issue isn't C++ dependencies, it is Lean itself. Mathlib is composed of several hundred large lean files, which all need to be run through lean. This involves running a bunch of tactics and each file takes a few seconds to minutes</p>

<p>If it is like that, then I could have let the VS Code plugin install <code>elan</code> directly rather than running the scripts? Is Python also a real dependency?</p>

<p>I am back. I just finished restarting. Either way, it still cannot find <code>update-mathlib</code> unfortunately. To make matters worse, it seems that Lean is not caching the library and it is taking long to typecheck that basic fragment. You can really feel the effort based on how long it takes the shell to react to my typing. So I am going to have to figure out how to do this. Any advice how I can go from here?</p>
<p>I see that <code>update-mathlib</code> is a Python script so I guess that answers one of my questions.</p>

<p>If the issue is as simple as not being able to find the python file then post your PATH variable (in linux it would be something like <code>echo $PATH</code>) and see if you can use the Windows search tools to find a file called <code>update-mathlib</code> somewhere on your system.</p>

<p>If you just type <code>update-mathlib</code> then the idea is that the OS looks through all the directories in the <code>$PATH</code> system variable and sees if it can find a file called <code>update-mathlib</code> in any of them.</p>

<p>And the output looked good? If so then create a file in src called <code>test.lean</code> and write something like <code>import data.real.basic</code> at the top. It's essential that you used the "open folder" command in VS Code and opened the project folder.</p>

If it gives you an error saying "can't find the <code>import data.real.basi</code>" and then there is an orange bar at the left side of the window which doesn't go away, that's bad (it means Lean did find data.real.basic but will now spend 2 minutes compiling it). If the orange bar goes away after a few seconds, that's good.</p>

<p>(the reason for the missing c is that when you were typing, Lean was compiling frantically, and the error was the last import that failed)</p>

<p>This is what happens when I try to open a terminal in VS Code right now. It seems there is something left over from the old version of the shell where it is setup to activate the Anaconda distro. Things like this happens when you just plop stuff in. Maybe that is why it did not just work out of the box.</p>

<p>Ok, I see what is going on.</p>
<p>(Git shell run directly from the shortcut)</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>Marko@Lain MINGW64 ~

C:\emacs-26.2-x86_64\bin....
</pre></div>


<p>I replaced the cutoff parts with <code>...</code> by hand. It seems that <code>.profile</code> only gets run when Git Bash is ran via the shortcut. Running it from VS Code will not have the <code>.elan</code> and <code>mathlib</code> directories be added to the PATH variable. That explains that.</p>
<p>With this I've finally successfully setup the project. I started work on this at 10am and it is nearly 3pm now. It should definitely be a priority for the devs to make it so that one can just clone the repo and point the compiler at the library. Even if it would take 10m to compile, that would still beat having to go through all these hoops.</p>
<p>I understand that the reason it took so long is partly my fault as I've given into the temptation of trying to save time by not following the instruction properly, but good installation instructions should not produce such temptation in the first place.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I let me offer my thanks for helping me with this once again. Cyao.</p>

<p>Hi, I think you missed a couple of important points. First who do you think are "devs" here? Do you mean the creator of Lean? He is a scholar engaged in a ten years research project,  and he wrote <em>everywhere</em> that Lean is not ready for unadventurous users. Taking care of users has never been his job, and it will probably never be. You can have a look at <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/documentation/" target="_blank" title="https://leanprover.github.io/documentation/">https://leanprover.github.io/documentation/</a> for instance, and the FAQ linked there. </p>
<p>Then there is the user community which you can meet here, and maintains everything at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/">https://github.com/leanprover-community/</a>, in particular <code>mathlib</code>. We do think Lean is already very nice to use, and we try to help people doing so. There are two kinds of users that are easy to help. Clueless users who blindly follows the instructions, and it works. Power users won't follow any instructions but will read the source code of scripts that clueless users are instructed to run, understand what they do, and do whatever they want (including compiling Lean itself from sources). This also work. Clueless users that refuse to follow instructions are much harder to help, especially when they use an exotic OS. </p>
<p>That being said, we still have a lot of work to do to improve installation instructions. And I'm sure that Kevin and Mario are happy that they could help you. But complaining that it took too long to satisfy you is probably not the wisest thing to do.</p>

Although I totally understand the motivation. I have been using Lean+MinGW for years now with no problems.</p>

<p>It has been a few months since I have recompiled mathlib. I am not at Lean right now, but isn't there an option to do a user-wide install of mathlib? Then it is compile once, use in many projects</p>

<p>Of course, avoiding compilation time is a desirable feature. I wonder if modifications to leanpkg would be welcome at this point? Properly speaking, this should be a responsibility of the package manager</p>

<p>Also, are .olean files even portable across systems? I recall reading that there were issues on ARM regarding this.</p>

<p>There were rumors about that but after writing olean-rs I can't find anything processor dependent in it, and we've been sharing olean files for a while now without issue</p>
