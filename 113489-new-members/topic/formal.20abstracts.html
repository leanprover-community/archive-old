<p>Tom Hales's Formal Abstracts project is not currently accepting contributions. Does Mathlib require formalizations with complete proofs or some kind of formal abstracts is acceptable?</p>

<p>We had plenty of "formal abstracts" in the perfectoid project for a long time (and some people warned us that this was a bad approach, but I think that they were being informed by computer science projects -- certainly the disaster stories I heard were computer science related).</p>

<p>IMO it's not a place for arbitrary "formal abstracts." There are lots of ways to define a concept, not all of them suited for proving things. Something that appears in that directory should be a mathlib-appropriate sketch, in that if the details are filled in, it can go in the main library.</p>

<p>It's easy to define something in a non-idiomatic way that won't mesh well with the rest of the library. For a random example, if you're doing something with limits, it should be done using filters. A theory set up with a more specific notion of limit isn't wrong, but probably won't integrate well.</p>

<p>The <code>roadmap</code> PR got merged while it was still in progress, but roughly speaking my thoughts are that theorem statements work better than definitions; for definitions one should expect that they might need to be adjusted for better compatibility with mathlib (or for correctness!) but for sufficiently simple definitions it is possible to get it right on the first try.</p>

<p>This is CS paranoia. I'm a mathematician, let's assume I got it right. Who cares if I got the definition wrong anyway? I can just fix it once the discovery is made by the lemma-makers. This "don't make definitions without proving theorems" attitude is stopping people who can't make definitions from proving theorems. If you don't want the definitions in <code>ring_theory</code> that's absolutely fine! But I would really like to be able to put them somewhere, so that people who don't know about out_params and all the other arcane rules about not extending things with fewer variables can still do something useful.</p>

<p>I am trying to figure out a way forward which makes it easier for people who know MSc level mathematics to be able to contribute by proving theorems which would be helpful for the development of algebra in mathlib. More and more of these people are appearing out of the woodwork. Look at the DVR thread. It's a farce. A poor student couldn't get the definition to compile and almost gave up completely.</p>

<p>There is general resistance to a top-down approach from the CS community, and Assia told me some nightmare story about some key wrong definition which cost a lot of time. But we tried a top down approach in the perfectoid project and it worked fine.</p>

<p>We went a little way down and then built up from the bottom and met in the middle.</p>

<p>The "little way down" was pretty much exactly what I am envisioning a formal abstract to be.</p>

<p>I would be happy to see definitions-only PRs to mathlib if there are no sorries, if the PR review is even more thorough than usual (say, at least two different persons say they are happy with the definition), and if the PRs are short (i.e., better 10 PRs with 10 definitions than one PR with 10 definitions).</p>

<p>I have been thinking about this because of pushing commutative algebra forwards. One big problem is that on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_valuation_ring">Wikipedia page for DVR</a> they literally give ten definitions. How is a beginner going to know where to start?</p>

<p>What about PRs in the roadmap directory? Will a PR with definitions and sketches of proofs be thoroughly reviewed? Such feedback would be very valuable or even critical for the top-down approach advertized by Kevin.</p>

<p>I don't know either what roadmaps are for, and how such PRs would be handled. We need to invent some rules!</p>

<p>Oh I meant in a bunch of private messages. I'd never heard this "offline" word before when I went to maths talks. In CS talks they use it all the time -- someone asks a question and the answer is "I can explain all this to you offline"</p>

<p>I think "definitions + sorried theorems" should be the minimum bar for <code>roadmap/</code>. Really though it should have some comments explaining the idea of the proof (not necessary even a math sketch --- even something saying "you should be able to prove this putting together existing results in <code>XXX/YYY.lean</code>).</p>

<p>I think we generally really need to explore the possibility that new contributors to mathlib don't need to start with a blank file. We want better mechanisms for divvying up the design / definition writing / theorem formulation / proofs amongst multiple people. Let's see if <code>roadmap/</code> can do this.</p>
