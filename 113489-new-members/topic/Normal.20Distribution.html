<p>Hi, I am new to lean and trying to prove properties of normal distribution, does anyone have any idea about I could represent the mean and variance in lean. Thanks for any help.</p>

<p>A couple of students at Imperial have been working on the Gaussian, although they didn't push anything since October. Their work is <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/b16836e66100a6d8eaae86c395b2480655c8e891/src/probability/gaussian.lean">here</a>.</p>

<p>There are ways of talking about the mean (expected value) and variance of a real random variable in Lean, but unfortunately Gaussian distributions are not yet in mathlib (at least not with enough API to make them usable without a lot of work). (Kevin's link above contains work on such topics that is not yet in mathlib.)</p>
<p>Some possible spellings of such things in Lean are in the following. (Although I would prefer more direct statements about probability measures on <code>ℝ</code> instead of indirect statements about the laws of <code>ℝ</code>-valued random variables, but Gaussians are not yet in mathlib in either form...)</p>

<span class="c1">-- I doubt that gaussian distributions have been defined in Lean's mathlib yet, so</span>
<span class="c1">-- at this point you should probably make further assumptions on the distribution of Z.</span>
<span class="c1">-- For example using the repo that Kevin linked to, one could write:</span>
<span class="c1">-- `variables m s : ℝ`</span>
<span class="c1">-- `variables measure.real_gaussian (ℙ.map Z) m s`</span>

<span class="c1">-- In any case, towards the spelling of the expected value and the variance...</span>

<span class="c1">-- (For Z ∉ L¹(ℙ) this yields a junk value, as the expected value is ill-defined.)</span>
<span class="c1">-- Another spelling of the same thing is:</span>

<p>Thanks a lot for your comments that's very helpful and clarifies my issues currently</p>
