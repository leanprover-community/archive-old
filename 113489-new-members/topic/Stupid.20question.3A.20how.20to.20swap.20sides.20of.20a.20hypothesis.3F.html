<p>If my context has a hypothesis</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">h</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="n">b</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>and I want to change it into the hypothesis <br>
<code>h : b = a </code><br>
 what's the recommended way to do that?  Naively trying <code>symmetry at h</code> produces the following error:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">symmetry</span> <span class="n">tactic</span> <span class="n">failed</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">target</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">not</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">relation</span> <span class="n">application</span> <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">expected</span> <span class="n">property.</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I can do</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">have</span> <span class="n">h_tmp</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">symmetry</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">exact</span> <span class="n">h</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">clear</span> <span class="n">h</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">rename</span> <span class="n">h_tmp</span> <span class="n">h</span><span class="o">,</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>which achieves the desired result, but this seems quite long-winded (especially in real examples where the two sides may be quite complicated rather than just "a" and "b") for such a simple change.  Surely there's an easier way to do this?</p>

<p>I believe <code>symmetry' at h</code> will work. (We need to add a tactic doc for this!)</p>
<p>However, I think I usually just write <code>h.symm</code> wherever I need to put the swapped version of <code>h</code>. (This is short for the term <code>eq.symm h</code>.)</p>

<p>Thank you loads, the apostrophe version has worked.  Should the error message reflect this more?  I think it's somewhat unintuitive that you need slightly different tactics for doing very similar changes on goals and hypotheses.  I'm sure I'm not the first person to be confused by this and I won't be the last, so maybe the error should mention the fix in this situation?</p>

<p>Well, what we really should do is just replace <code>symmetry</code> with <code>symmetry'</code> (see e.g. <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/issues/124">lean#124</a>), but there's not much appetite for this right now given that Lean 4 is right on the horizon.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="383881">@Nicholas Dyson</span> The problem is (I think) that <code>symmetry</code> is defined in the core repo. For a long time we couldn't change that repo. So mathlib added its own version <code>symmetry'</code>. But once we got used to it, we never updated the version in core after we forked the core repo.</p>

<p>There's a couple cases like that, where mathlib has improved versions of core tactics. Is it feasible to merge those in lean4?</p>

<p>I think Lean 4 will make it much easier to override core tactics since they'll all be written in Lean (as opposed to C++).</p>
