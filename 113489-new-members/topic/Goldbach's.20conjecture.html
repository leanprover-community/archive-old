<p>There is a proof in Arxiv that might be suited to a Lean verification: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.02415.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.02415.pdf</a></p>
<p>This seems to be a popular topic in the Lean space: <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/5eb718d0e7c54e001a6e03b8">https://www.codewars.com/kata/5eb718d0e7c54e001a6e03b8</a>, including this topic by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110865">@Jeremy Avigad</span> : <a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/Talks/oxford_formal_methods.pdf">http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/Talks/oxford_formal_methods.pdf</a></p>
<p>Not asking a question, just reflecting on the exercise.</p>

<p>The proof on arxiv seems unlikely to be correct, Goldbach's conjecture (when stated properly) is still an open problem in math.</p>

<p>I should say that I made that kata as a bit of fun about checking the statement you're trying to prove, not as any serious attempt to resolve the Goldbach conjecture</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="246273">@Bhavik Mehta</span>.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="127136">@Alex J. Best</span> , precisely because it is likely to be incorrect, it seems like it would fun to see if it is clean enough to formalize in Lean, and then to find the flaw.</p>

<p>Generally the way these things go is that it will be harder to find any part that is correct.</p>

<p><del>I can tell you there is at least one flaw at the bottom of page 6 because what he claims is an overestimate is in fact an underestimate for eg 4, 10 (I didn't spot this, shamelessly stealing from someone else). I also think the only thing he actually proves is that at there exists at least one sum of prime + composite odd numbers which is.... obvious. Could be wrong about that though I haven't really read it.</del></p>

<p>I might have been wrong about this. I misread a definition.</p>

<p>I was underwhelmed. There is a lot of imprecise thinking and bad notation, and ultimately what is derived is an approximation at large numbers (without watching the approximation bounds), not an actual lower bound, and on page 13, to compare to the real value, it amounts to "I plotted it and it looks pretty good up to 5000"</p>
