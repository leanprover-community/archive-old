<p>I noticed that performance becomes a problem with long calc chains. Can someone give me advice on what patterns work well for performance (in vscode):</p>
<p>i.e. What is the scope of effort that the logic engine has to perform on each change to the text?</p>
<p>What does the engine re-process on each change?</p>
<ul>
<li>the file and all imports (whether or not they are used)</li>
<li>the entire logic chain (all imports and dependencies that are used)</li>
<li>everything in the changed file</li>
<li>only the theorem that has changed in the changed file</li>
<li>only the statements at and after the change in the changed file</li>
</ul>
<p>I suspect it is the 3rd or 4th case, but it would be helpful to know the best way to organize files.</p>
<p>Specifically, my question is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should I move complex theorems to their own files and make sure not to import them unless they are required?</li>
<li>Is it enough to keep complex logic in its own theorem (even in the current file)?</li>
</ul>

<p>So that sounds like the 4th option (the entire current theorem - when working on a tactic script), which would include the statements above the current.</p>
<p>I guess I meant by statement was a single tactic being used (not a whole theorem or lemma), maybe I'm using the wrong terms.</p>

<p>"Expression" has a specific meaning in lean. An expression is any term used for denoting an element of the type theory, for example <code>x</code> or <code>2+2</code> or <code>have foo, from bar, baz</code> or <code>show foo, from bar</code> or <code>begin tactics... end</code></p>

<p>I think because of proof irrelevance, Lean can start checking a proof before it has validated its dependencies? So splitting a proof can result in more parallelism than you might think</p>

<p>Well, technically you can inspect the value of a proof from another proof, and of course <code>#print</code> will also look at proof terms, but this is basically joining on a future and is relatively rare in the process</p>

<p>so for the most part it is just running the definitions and theorem statements on one thread and then spawning asynchronous proof elaboration tasks</p>
