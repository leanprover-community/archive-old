<p>I wrote up my comments and complaints about the Natural number game as I went <a href="https://pastebin.com/pvvBmBnT">https://pastebin.com/pvvBmBnT</a> in case someone is interested; I imagine this is useful data, but if it's not, feel free to ignore, cost me nothing to write it down. (I am a relative noob, I finished the game in maybe 4 hours. Maybe a year ago I spent a few days reading about Lean, and I do have some past functional programming experience.)</p>

<p>Nice job! Install lean on your computer following the instructions at <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html">https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html</a> and then clone the repo with <code>leanproject get ImperialCollegeLondon/natural_number_game</code>, open the root directory of the project in VS Code and then navigate to <code>src/game/world10/level18q.lean</code> and see if you can prove strong induction :-)</p>
<p>Re: your comments. (1) yeah people do stuff in different ways to the official solutions (available <a href="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/natural_number_game/tree/master/src/game">here</a>) and it is somehow impossible to explain all the relevant tactics for all approaches. (2) yeah there's nothing I can do about 0; defaulting to nat is baked into core Lean 3  (3) yes it's exactly all about the brackets. () means "you need to write this", {} means "Lean's elaborator will figure it out". (4) yeah, sorry, it's a bit clunky. This is because you're running an interactive theorem prover in javascript. (5) yeah, in VS Code there are tools like "pause".</p>
