<p>I have a result of this form: M(x) is a metric space iff x&lt;1. Here x is some parameter that the space depends on.</p>
<p>I have proved using <code>instance</code> that, under the assumption x&lt;1, I have a <code>metric_space</code> but is there a natural way to prove that something is not a metric space?</p>
<p>Of course, I can just prove that the relevant axiom fails, e.g., triangle inequality, but I wonder if I can then conclude "it's not (or cannot be made into) a metric space"?</p>

<p><del><code>\not metric_space X</code> is short for <code>metric_space X -&gt; false</code>, i.e. that an instance of <code>metric_space X</code> leads to a contradiction.</del></p>
<p><strong>edit</strong>: I didn't think enough about this, see below!</p>

<p>It's not very convenient to state this because of how the data and properties of a metric space are bundled together, but you can write something like "there does not exist a <code>metric_space</code> whose distance function equals (blah)".</p>

<p>If you're just going to prove that the triangle inequality fails directly then it's probably more sensible to just state that instead.</p>

<p>Note that any type can be made into a metric space by just giving it the discrete metric, so <code>metric_space X -&gt; false</code> is probably not what you want.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> yeah, I didn't mean it literally <span aria-label="upside down" class="emoji emoji-1f643" role="img" title="upside down">:upside_down:</span><br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span> that's exactly what I mean, "there does not exist a <code>metric_space</code> with distance function (blah)". Imagine that for some values of x the triangle inequality fails, for other values the symmetry condition fails...</p>
