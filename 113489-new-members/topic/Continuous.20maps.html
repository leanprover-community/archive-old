<p>Is there any particular reason why continuous maps are defined with <code>def</code> instead of being a structure such as linear maps? I am asking because when working with smooth maps I realize that if they were defined as a structure and smooth maps could be defined as a structure extending continuous maps, everything would be way more natural and smooth (no PUN intended!)</p>

<p>I asked a <a href="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Bounded.20continuous.20functions/near/197186991">related question</a> about bounded continuous functions a couple of months ago.  To summarize <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110050">@Sebastien Gouezel</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="214703">@Yury G. Kudryashov</span>'s answers there, indeed maybe it should be a structure, but this refactor is low priority.</p>

<p>I mean Sebastien plans to define smooth functions between manifolds as</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">times_cont_mdiff</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">with_top</span> <span class="bp">ℕ</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">M</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">M&#39;</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:=</span>
<span class="n">continuous</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="bp">∧</span> <span class="n">other_stuff</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>At this point I am not really sure If I should define a diffeomorphism as a structure extending a homeomorphism which would therefore require twice a proof that the map is continuous (I mean it'd be fine but dirty) or more basically as</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">structure</span> <span class="n">diffeomorph</span> <span class="kn">extends</span> <span class="n">M</span> <span class="err">≃</span> <span class="n">M&#39;</span> <span class="o">:=</span>
<span class="o">(</span><span class="n">smooth_to_fun</span>  <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">smooth</span> <span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">I&#39;</span> <span class="n">to_fun</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">(</span><span class="n">smooth_inv_fun</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">smooth</span> <span class="n">I&#39;</span> <span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">inv_fun</span><span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>and then manually define all the coercions to homeomorphisms (more clean but more work)</p>
<p>PS.: <code>smooth</code> is an abbreviation for <code>times_cont_mdiff \top</code></p>

<p>I mean I guess my question can be made more general as, why when implementing a concrete category in mathlib, sometimes morphisms are formalized as structure with a <code>to_fun</code> field and sometimes as properties with a true/false value?

<p>I think it's pretty likely that <code>continuous</code> has to exist as a <code>Prop</code> (even in a clean-slate redesign) whether or not you also use a name for a bundled continuous function.</p>

<p>My point is that in geometry you can add a lot of structures to a manifold and then deal with morphisms that preserve those structures. I believe that for continuous maps and smooth functions it makes sense to have things defined both in terms of properties and bundled maps for the reason you said but at some points you start dealing with morphisms such as maps preserving a connection or any kind of structure and you care less about proving that a specific map has that property and treat things more as morphism just as for algebraic structure. And I believe it'd be very clean, if it is not too much of an effort, to have versions of bundled continuous maps and smooth maps and theorems proving things about them in such a way that whenever you add the nth structure on top of your manifold with (n-1) structures you just need to extend the morphisms you had and have automatic coercions</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="267205">@Nicolò Cavalleri</span>, have you looked at the category <code>Top</code>? That uses bundled continuous maps, and indeed allows you to simply write things like <code>variables {X Y : Top} (f : X ⟶ Y)</code> and that slightly-different-from-normal arrow means that <code>f</code> is automatically a continuous map.</p>

<p>I actually did look into Top but would you suggest using this version of the bundled map for geometry? It seemed to me that in Mathlib the style is to formalize things without category theory at first and then add category theory when things are already established (at least for maths that, possibly, can be done without too much category theory such as differential geometry)</p>

<p>I can but the problem I have with categories now is that it seems to require way more work than just restating some theorems for continuous bundled maps and since I am doing all of this for a summer project at Cambridge to formalize some mathematical physics and we are already quite behind, I might just do things the way they were started and then come back to this after my project I guess</p>

<p>When you're just using category theory as a language, like you are (as a way to bundle morphisms) you won't need to learn any of the category theory language other than the way to compose morphisms. You will for example never need a functor. You will just need to learn the new way of saying "let X be a manifold" (which is easier than the old way, it's just <code>X: Manifold</code>) and how to move between the old way to the new way, which is easy with concrete categories. It is not a big ask for those DAMPTers.</p>

<p>Yes sure I take it that it's not a lot to learn even though the problem of taking much more time to implement it subsists. The cool thing about not doing it with category theory is that I can use topology as a model to implement many things. Say that for example I need to implement diffeomorphisms or local_diffeomorphisms. I can just copy the files homeomorphism and local_homeomorphism, read them and keep all the lemmas (especially the simp ones) that make sense for diffeomorphisms, do a couple of replace, like homeo with diffeo and continuous with smooth, and voilà in 2 hours of work I have a pretty decent implementation of diffeomorphisms I can work with</p>

<p>For 2., what I have in mind is, e.g., there are many interesting adjunctions in mathematics worth having in mathlib. It's important that they all get stated as an <code>adjunction</code>, rather than using a different formulation of what it means to be an adjunction each time (which is prone to leaving bits out). We already have quite a few "universal properties" stated in mathlib which ideally we would clean up and state "properly" as an initialness condition, or an adjunction, etc. Similarly we have a bunch of "informal" functoriality statements.</p>

<p>I think proving the snake lemma (and all other lemmas in homological algebra) via category theory might help. Otherwise we would have to prove them for add_comm_groups, for module, and later for abelian sheaves. And these proofs aren't exactly 1-liners.<br>
Maybe (maybe) we still want to restate the snake lemma for (say) modules, without using the categorical language, because that way it might integrate better with other parts of the library. But I'm convinced that Markus's diagram chasing library will be a gateway drug to proving these kinds of lemmas using the category theory library.</p>
