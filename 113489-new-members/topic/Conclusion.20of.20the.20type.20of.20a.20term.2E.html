<p>I realise that though I can use it, I don't really understand what <code>apply</code> does.  The docs state that apply tries to match the current goal with the conclusion of the type of the term. Consider the following example. I use <code>apply</code> with the term <code>foo</code>. </p>
<p>There are two things I could see might be happening here.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The type of <code>foo</code> matches with the type of the goal, up to the types of the variables which are then inferred, closing the goal or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>apply</code> matches the 'conclusion' of the type of <code>foo</code> (which I'd guess to be something like <code>q ∧ p</code>) with the goal. But this is where I'm stuck in understanding what is meant by the current goal. Certainly, <code>(a → b) ∧ (b ∧ a) → (b ∧ a) ∧ (a → b) </code> doesn't seem to match with <code>q ∧ p</code>. So is it that the 'conclusion' of the goal is matched with the conclusion of the type of <code>foo</code> and the proof of the remaining subgoals closed by inference?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Or is it something entirely different?</p>
<p>I'm sure someone more versed in meta programming than I could understand things perfectly just by reading the source. But is there a simple description of what is meant by the conclusion of the type of a term and (say in the example below) how it matches with the goal?</p>

<p>Basically <code>apply foo</code> means <code>refine foo</code> followed by some <code>_</code>s, the number of which is determined by a heuristic</p>

<p>The heuristic is: look at the types of the goal and <code>foo</code> and see how many <code>Pi/-&gt;</code>s each one ends in, and subtract the former from the latter.</p>

<p>This heuristic probably sounds like it would always work, but it doesn't and sometimes <code>apply</code> inserts the wrong number of <code>_</code>s, which we call "the apply bug".</p>

<p>When cleaning up proofs, I often replace <code>apply foo</code> with <code>refine foo</code> and start adding <code>_</code> until lean doesn't complain. This is a good strategy I think when you want to replace a bunch of <code>apply foo</code>s with <code>exact bar</code></p>

<p>We should add some of the above info to the tactic doc!</p>
