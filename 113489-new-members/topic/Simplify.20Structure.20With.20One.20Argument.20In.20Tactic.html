<p>Hi, essentially, I have a goal of the form </p>
<p>{to_a := a_2} + {to_a := a_1} + {to_a := a_0} = {to_a := a_2} + ({to_a := a_1} + {to_a := a_0}).</p>
<p>These are destructed structures (you can use induction or cases to get something similar) that extend "a" and have no arguments.</p>
<p>I can prove <br>
a_2 + a_1 + a_0 = a_2 + (a_1 + a_0). What is the simplest way to change the goal and get rid of the bracket/structure cruft? Or, can I go from a_2 + a_1 + a_0 = a_2 + (a_1 + a_0) to the goal? I've tried using various tactics, split, constructor, injection seems to do the opposite of what I need.  I am guessing there is a simple way to do this but for the life of me can't find the right tactic.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help!</p>

<p>When you defined your structure, add an <code>[ext]</code> attribute above it. That will autogenerate an extensionality lemma, which you can use via the <code>ext</code> tactic</p>

<p>Thank you. Sorry, I should have mentioned, I do have that actually, however,  I get this goal when I use ext : </p>
<p>(a + b + c).to_a.to_prod.fst = (a + (b + c)).to_a.to_prod.fst</p>
<p>which I can technically prove, but I have a proof of "a_2 + a_1 + a_0 = a_2 + (a_1 + a_0)" which I was specifically hoping to use. Is that a bad way to go about things or is there some way I can still remove the structure junk without ext?</p>

<p>If you have a proof of a + b + c = a + (b + c), then you could rewrite using that proof as a premise.</p>
<p>Or is the issue about the difference between a_0 etc. and a etc.?</p>

<p>Don't think I can. To clarify, I have a proof of a.to_a + b.to_a + c.to_a = a.to_a + (b.to_a + c.to_a) but not a + b + c = a + (b + c), which is the ultimate goal. The "_0, _1, _2" stuff is just caused by destructing a, b, c</p>

<p>I will do that in a bit. Thank you for the suggestion.</p>

<p>You need lemmas saying <code>(a + b).to_a = a.to_a + b.to_a</code> and so on; these are probably true by <code>rfl</code> and <code>@[simps]</code> will automatically generate them</p>

<p>I gave that a quick try and that actually worked really cleanly. After those lemmas all I needed to was cc. Thank you very much (and Greg and Yakov)!</p>
