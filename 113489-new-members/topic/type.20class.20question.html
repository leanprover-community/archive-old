<p>Hello! I have some basic mathlib-related questions:<br>
Given a module \beta over a field \alpha where \beta is a ring I want to define the morphism \alpha \to \beta, given by x \mapsto x * 1_\beta.<br>
So I have this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">universes</span> <span class="n">u</span> <span class="n">v</span>
<span class="kn">variables</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">α</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span> <span class="n">u</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">β</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span> <span class="n">v</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="kn">variables</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">field</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">comm_ring</span> <span class="n">β</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">module</span> <span class="n">α</span> <span class="n">β</span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="n">def</span> <span class="n">struct_hom</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">α</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">β</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="bp">λ</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="err">•</span> <span class="n">has_one</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">one</span> <span class="n">β</span>
</pre></div>


<p>(some of this may be nonsense!)<br>
I get:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>maximum class-instance resolution depth has been reached (the limit can be increased by setting option &#39;class.instance_max_depth&#39;) (the class-instance resolution trace can be visualized by setting option &#39;trace.class_instances&#39;)
</pre></div>


<p>I guess  the system has trouble disambiguating some of the terms in the lambda definition. How can I supply the necessary constraints ?<br>
Thanks!</p>

<p>Whilst I'm not entirely sure why that's happening, I guess that one problem with the way you're setting things up here is that the alpha-module structure on beta will be completely unrelated to the commutative ring structure (so for example you will not even know that the addition on beta-as-alpha-module equals the addition on beta-as-commutative-ring), which is presumably not what you want.</p>

<p>There is already a theory of alpha-algebras which solves this problem and you probably want to use that.</p>

<p>NB when using mathematical objects I am on a crusade to stay away from this alpha beta etc notation and stick to the notation we're used to; initially this was just mathematicians trying to cause trouble but more recently there have been situations where the computer scientists have seen the value of this convention and my impression is that they're coming round to it.</p>

<p>The house style is that, but mathematicians sort-of rebelled against it and because mathematicians infiltrated the mathlib maintainers it started slipping through into the library.</p>

<p>I think it's the unique case where mathematicians have suggested a notational change which the CS people could see the merits of. When we started suggesting that they called every lemma something like lemma 13.4 they were adamant that their more expressive system was a much better idea ;-)</p>

<p>You should demand that p is monic, to stop p=0 from letting everything be algebraic. And all this <code>has_zero.zero R</code> -- you can just write this as <code>(0 : R)</code>. That's exactly the point of the <code>has_zero</code> typeclass -- it is a type class written specifically so that we can use <code>0</code> notation.</p>

<p>If you demand it's non-zero then you will often have to apply a lemma saying "if there's a non-zero poly which works then there's a monic poly which works" because we often say "wlog it's monic". On the other hand if you demand it's monic then you won't have to apply this lemma, but if you are trying to prove a specific thing is algebraic and you only manage to find a non-zero poly, you'll have to apply the lemma above. So you have to make a guess about whether you will say "wlog it's monic" more times than being in a situation where you've constructed a non-zero polynomial which is not obviously monic in a proof that something is algebraic, and in my comment I was implicitly guessing that there will be more wlogs.</p>

<p>In maths we can just say "TFAE: (a) there's a non-zero poly (b) there's a monic poly. We define _algebraic_ to mean both of them". The advantage with this approach is that whichever one you need, you can just say it's true "by definition" :D In formalising you have to choose one of them to be the definition and then you prove the lemma that it's equivalent to the other one and then only some percentage of things are true "by definition" and the trick if you want to write smaller faster code is to maximise this percentage.</p>
