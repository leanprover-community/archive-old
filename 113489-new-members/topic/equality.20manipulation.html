<p>Question 1:     I have  h:t=s   and I want to reverse it.    If it's in the goal I can do rw symmetry  but   rw symmetry at h doesn't work.<br>
It's surely silly but     have h2:s=t:= begin finish end,    does work.  But I'm sure it's not the right way.</p>
<p>Question 2.   I have    h1 :  x = single u   and   h2: y = single u    and I want  to write  have h3:x=y   for some reason.<br>
I tried  have h3:x=y:= begin ifinish end    and got  "deep recursion..."    Since posting this I realized the obvious <br>
answer is rw\left h2 at h1.   Never mind.   But I still don't know about question 1.</p>

<p>rw eq_comm works</p>

<p>depends on who you're asking, <code>have h2 : s = t := begin finish end</code> might be the right way</p>

<p>You can also use <code>h.symm</code>. I think there's also a <code>symmetry'</code> tactic which might allow <code>at h</code></p>
