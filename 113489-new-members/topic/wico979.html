<p>Hi, I'm wico979, I'm an undergraduate student of mathematics (well, technically not <em>exactly</em> yet but it would take long to explain) and am interested in learning Lean. Currently confused about whether to install Lean 3 or Lean 4, any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Welcome! At the moment, the Lean mathematics community is mostly still focussed on Lean 3, although we are hard at work at moving everything to Lean 4. So if you want to do mathematics in Lean, then I would recommend the Lean 3 (community edition). If you want to program in Lean, and have your programs run quickly, then Lean 4 would be a better choice since its programming capabilities are much better.</p>

<p>I'll go with Lean 3 then, thanks!</p>

<p>We have a page of resources for learning Lean 3 <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html">here</a>.</p>
