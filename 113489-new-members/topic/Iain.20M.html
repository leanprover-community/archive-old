<p>Hi all! Introducing myself as per the local custom - I'm Iain, a software developer from the UK. I did an MMath about a decade ago, but decided against doing a PhD in combinatorics for reasons I don't really remember any more, and have been writing code for money ever since.</p>
<p>I have a long running interest in the idea of digitally formalising mathematics, as it's the intersection of two things I understand and enjoy. I've been dabbling in it on the side for a while, going as far as to play with writing my own (rather unpolished) proof assistant / explorer. I'm particularly interested in how to make libraries of formalised proofs explorable, accessible and readable without specialised knowledge, and would very much appreciate pointers to any active work in this area (Lean or otherwise).</p>
<p>At the moment I'm keen just to learn more about Lean and how it works in practice, hopefully by making some contributions to mathlib and getting some experience using it. I look forward to asking a bunch of beginner questions here shortly :)</p>

<p>There are definitely people around thinking about this. You may be interested in our <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-53518-6_16">recent paper</a> about linting and docs. We're very happy to take feedback about the docs, and even happier to see PRs with improvements!</p>

<p>I actually read that paper yesterday :) I'm definitely on board with the idea of maintaining and expanding docs, and hope to contribute to that to the extent I contribute to the underlying library. But I was trying to get at something more ambitious - the idea that formal proofs in advanced areas could and possibly should be be displayed in a format that is substantially more readable than, say, the current Wikipedia page for that same proof. I'm imagining something like a cross between Metamath's Proof Explorer and the idea of a <a href="http://cs500.cs.ua.edu/Lamport.pdf">structured proof</a>, to pick two things I can gesture at that I know actually already exist.</p>

<p>The basic idea is that you should be able to mix normal text and Lean code, and have access to the tactic state evolving in a proof without installing Lean.</p>

<p>The idea of structure proof, as implemented in Isabelle, will never be enough to give access to the full information available in a proof assistant. You need something interactive where you can click when you want to see more context, more details, more implicit stuff...</p>

<p>I hadn't seen that, and I was intially excited by it, but it looks like it's just producing the HTML from comments, no? So you just have a non-formal proof interleaved with (and maintained separately to) a formal proof, with no real structural relationship between them. An obvious problem for turning that into a structured proof would be if you wanted to expand out a tricky application of linarith or something . You'd need some way of turning the formal proof that outputs (which is obviously uncommented because it's autogenerated) into readable HTML as well - and once you have that, what do you need the comments for?</p>

<p>yeah, but that's basically saying that the <code>linarith</code> proof is atomic, there is no lower level in the structured proof, even though it's still quite possibly not convincing due to its complexity</p>

<p>I love the idea of translating tactic gobbledegook into readable LaTeX (or at least, readable HTML). I mean, that's the end goal I'm talking about. I just honestly think that the strategy of "do it all manually" would likely turn out to be less feasible than solving the hard problem of doing it automatically.</p>

<p>Iain, I understand your concern about tactics that do non-trivial work. But, as far as research-level mathematics is concerned, this is a completely virtual issue. We are very far from having tactics that do steps we would like to see explicit, even in a very detailed proof. Sure, <code>linarith</code> can already do a bit too much when I use Lean to teach first year undergrad, but not much more.</p>

<p>I can confirm, I think <code>linarith</code> will be remembered by every student of this year as <em>the</em> magic tactic. I remember seeing people trying it after every single tactic call, to see if it would help.</p>
