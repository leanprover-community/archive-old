<p>This used to work in the past (there was a <code>nat.pow</code> in core Lean), but it was really annoying how <code>nat.pow</code> was not definitionally equal to <code>monoid.pow</code>, so after the fork in 2019 we removed it from core.</p>
<p>When I'm doing mathematics I start every file with <code>import tactic</code> and encourage my students to do the same, precisely so they don't keep asking me questions like this. <code>import tactic</code> is a catch-all import which gives you a lot of stuff which you would expect to be there if you're doing mathematics.</p>

<p>That's confusing.  It sounds like it just imports tactics.</p>

<p>Imports in lean are transitive, so while it does import many tactics it also happens to include a lot of things needed by tactics like <code>norm_num</code> to run, so most things that one would expect to always have available</p>
