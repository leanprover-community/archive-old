<p>I'm experiencing the issue discussed by Bjørn below: </p>
<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="347475">Bjørn Kjos-Hanssen</span> <a href="#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/dite.20proofs/near/218626011">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I <code>#print</code> the proof term, it is very long, and moreover when I try to use it directly in my code, I get <code>invalid 'eq.rec' application, </code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm attempting to reference a subproof (in the form of an underscore) that is contained within my goal. This subproof does not work when copied because of an invalid 'eq.rec' application. Is there a more proper way to reference these proofs? library_search manages to solve the goal, but using its output does not. I presume this is unintended behavior.</p>

<p>Can you give a <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mwe.html">#mwe</a> ?</p>

<p>Getting a mwe might be difficult for this sort of scenario. I found a solution, albeit a 100 line copy-paste solution. For those who are experiencing the same issue, try temporarily setting <code>set_option pp.all true </code>.</p>

<p>There was maybe a relevant recent discussion here:<br>

<p>You can wrap your tactic in <code>show_term { ... }</code> to see the term that the tactic constructs (see <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#show_term">tactic#show_term</a>). In many cases the term is much too large and complex to be of any use though.</p>

<p>It would be great if there were a tactic to extract <code>_</code> proofs within the goal state into local hypotheses</p>

<p>It sounds like you took a wrong turn earlier.</p>
