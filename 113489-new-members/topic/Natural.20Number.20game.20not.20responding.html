<p>I'm playing the Natural Number game and I've got as far as Advanced Addition world and I did something silly (I typed "repeat {rw add_comm}" because I wanted to rewrite both sides of the equality "a + t = b + t").  Now I just get the message "Lean is busy ..." because I suppose it's still rewriting "a + t" to "t + a" and back.  Is there anything I can do to stop or reset Lean?  If I press the reset button, will it reset my progress for just this world, or the whole game?<br>
Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

<p>Can you just delete the repeat {rw} line and then reload the page?</p>

<p>Oh, yes, that worked!  I'd already deleted the line, but I hadn't thought of reloading the page.  I suppose I had assumed it would lose my progress...<br>
Thank you very much! (And I love the game, by the way.)</p>

<p>I wasn't entirely sure what would happen either, I didn't do any of the web stuff.</p>
