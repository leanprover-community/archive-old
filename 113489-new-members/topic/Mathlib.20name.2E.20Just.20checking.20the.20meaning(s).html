<p>On the StackExchange site there is a need for tags for Mathlib. My understanding is that for Lean 3 there is Mathlib and for Lean 4 there is Mathlib 4. Is this correct? Also there are no other things that could be confused with mathlib or would such tags need Lean with them, e.g. <em>lean-mathlib</em>?</p>

<p>Not answering the question, but in the wild when I mention mathlib, I tend to write lean/mathlib, to recognize there are two parts coming together (so a sort of Stallman-like approach, where he writes GNU/Linux).</p>
<p>I do this mainly to help people who only have heard about Lean to know to search for mathlib, too.</p>

<p>At the moment there is a mathlib 4, but I'd describe that more as the future version of mathlib being developed in a separate repository instead of an independent project. The expectation is that the whole community will switch eventually.</p>
<p>I don't expect <code>mathlib</code> by itself will be confusing in the context of the Proof Assistant site. Although the name mathlib is generic enough that <code>lean-mathlib</code> is also fine for me. A quick search shows:</p>

<p>I see this with a lot of proof assistants.  metamath is a completely generic logic-agnostic proof assistant, but metamath/set.mm is based on ZFC.  I guess Isabelle already goes by Isabelle/HOL but most people probably mean Isabelle/HOL/AFP.  I don't know about Coq though...  When people say Lean vs Coq, they usually mean Lean/mathlib vs Coq, but I guess that is the point since Coq has many libraries.</p>

<p>Does AFP contain a lot of user-contributed tactics though? I often find it hard to use lean without mathlib because there are just so many tactics, automation and linters that are very useful that you can only get by adding a mathlib dependency, even if I want to write something that doesn't involve mathematics at all!<br>
In that sense it seems Lean and mathlib might be a bit more closely tied than just a proof assistant and a mathemtics library for it.</p>

<p>Furthermore I would imagine that disassociating the tactics from the maths would be very hard work. Tactics like <code>nlinarith</code> will no doubt use a lot of stuff in the earlier parts of mathlib.</p>

<p>I wonder to what extent the fact that lean is written in lean has made our lives easier here. I think the Coq community doesn't have this luxury.</p>

<p>Coq users can metaprogram in Coq itself and thus write tactics/plugins/extensions in Coq, via MetaCoq: <a href="https://github.com/MetaCoq/metacoq">https://github.com/MetaCoq/metacoq</a></p>

<p>also, on the topic  of Coq vs. its libraries. Coq now has a fully working <code>-noinit</code> option that avoids loading any part of the Coq standard library at startup. This is used most prominently by the Coq-HoTT library, but other libraries such as MathComp are also usable in this way (though not officially like Coq-HoTT).</p>
