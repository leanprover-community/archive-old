<p>Hello! My name is Timothy Chow. Some of you might recognize my name from MathOverflow. The reason I decided to join this forum at this time is that I have been having some discussions with Randall Holmes about the possibility of formalizing his proof of the consistency of NF in Lean. I will say more about that over in the maths stream.</p>
