<p>My PR <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9345">#9345</a> was dependent on PR <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10941">#10941</a>, which just got merged. The problem is that Bors also closed <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9345">#9345</a>, which hasn't been merged yet. Is there a way to reopen it, or should I just open a new PR?</p>

<p>I think the issue is that I set <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9345">#9345</a> to merge into the branch I was PR ing with <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10941">#10941</a>.</p>

<p>I just undeleted the branch, reopened then changed the base of <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9345">#9345</a>, then redeleted the deleted branch. Your diagnosis is correct about why this happened</p>

<p>When a branch is deleted, Github automatically closes any PRs against that branch, and attributes the user who deleted the branch to their closure.</p>
