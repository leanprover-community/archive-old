<p>Section 6.6 of Theorem Proving in Lean says,</p>
<p>Leanâ€™s core library declares the left-binding powers of a number of common symbols.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/library/init/core.lean">https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/library/init/core.lean</a><br>
You are welcome to overload these symbols for your own use, but you cannot change their binding power.</p>
<p>That seems to be false--in my ignorance I declared binding powers for some of these operators<br>
at the top of my first file.  If I remove those lines  there's no problem with the parsing, indicating that<br>
infix is still ok,  but my proofs no longer check,  indicating that the binding powers I had declared<br>
were in force, rather than the defaults,  before I removed those lines.   Put those lines back,  of <br>
course the project builds again.</p>

<p>I also believe that to be false. You _can_ change the binding power. Maybe what the book means is that you _probably_ shouldn't.</p>

<p>For reference, this is an thread where redefining the binding power of existing notation fixed a problem I was having: <a href="#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/Substitution.20notation">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/Substitution.20notation</a></p>

<p>Also. It is always possible that it wasn't possible when the book was written.</p>

<p>The statement was probably true when it was first written. Lean changed a lot over the years, and I am guessing that this changed and nobody noticed  (until now) that the documentation was out of date. I'll fix it.</p>
