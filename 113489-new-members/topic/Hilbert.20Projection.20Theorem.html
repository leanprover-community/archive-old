<p>Based on a discussion in <a href="#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/Starting.20to.20contribute.20to.20mathlib">this "starting to contribute to mathlib" thread</a>, I wanna try to prove the Hilbert Projection Theorem in Lean. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="260507">@Heather Macbeth</span> </p>
<p>however I can't actually find the definition of a hilbert space.<br>
There is a definition of an inner product space in <code>analysis/normed_space/real_inner_product</code>, but I can't find any <code>hilbert_space</code></p>
<p>What should I do? ( note this is my first attempt at contributing to mathlib)</p>

<p><code>Type*</code> is the same as <code>Type _</code>, that is, it infers a suitable universe or universe variable to put there. You should prefer it over <code>Type u</code> if you can use it, since it doesn't require declaring a universe variable <code>u</code>. But they have the same effect in the end</p>

<p>I'm somewhat concerned that the Riesz representation theorem is a bit hard. It's not totally out of reach but it relies on some abstractions that aren't intuitive to me. I could do it, but I predict it'll be a bit inefficient as a first project (I'd have to spend some more time studying Hilbert spaces, as opposed to focusing on the formalization).</p>
<p>I'd still be willing to do it if there aren't better options. (see my <a href="#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/Starting.20to.20contribute.20to.20mathlib">Starting to contribute to mathlib</a> thread)</p>

<p>OK, a few more ideas: (1) the double dual of a finite-dimensional normed space is itself (should be fairly easy using <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/linear_map.continuous_of_finite_dimensional">docs#linear_map.continuous_of_finite_dimensional</a>), (2) Stone-Weierstrass theorem (mathlib has the Banach algebra <code>C(X)</code>, you'd need to define "separates points"), (3) Mertens' theorem on the product of two series, (4) Riemann's theorem on rearranging series.  If you wanted something more geometric, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="266253">@Joseph Myers</span>  might have some ideas (my first thought would be the theorem that a distance-preserving self-map of the plane is determined by its values at 3 points, but I don't know whether the preliminaries exist yet).</p>

<p>For Stone-Weierstrass, the proofs I know fall into two camps:</p>
<ol>
<li>prove the Weierstrass theorem first (e.g. develop Bernstein polynomials)</li>
<li>avoid it somehow, but not trivially. e.g. there's a direct proof in Pedersen's "Analysis Now", but from memory it requires knowing about uniform convergence of a Taylor series.</li>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="260507">@Heather Macbeth</span> , I'll look into those, (I don't know the theorem statements), but I don't have time right now, so let me just ask this question: Does it make sense for me to go through a couple of textbooks, and list quite a few theorems from them myself, and post them here as suggestions? Is this a reasonable thing to do, or is there already so much formalized regarding Linear algebra, etc, that this wouldn't generate anything useful?

<p>The thing I'm concerned about with some of the more complex theorems is that I'll end up being slowed down a lot by not yet knowing how mathlib structures things. Does it make sense for me to be very hacky about it, even introducing definitions  that would not be library-quality definitions, with the expectation of later cleaning it up with help on zulip?</p>

<p>I think "a distance-preserving self-map of the plane is determined by its values at 3 points" (those points need to be affinely independent) splits into a few pieces, some present in mathlib and some not.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An isometry of Euclidean spaces is an affine map. If surjective, we have <code>analysis/normed_space/mazur_ulam</code>. So either (a) state in a form requiring surjectivity, (b) prove surjectivity for any isometry from a finite-dimensional Euclidean space to one of the same dimension (or some such statement in a more general context) or (c) prove that isometries of Euclidean spaces are affine maps whether or not surjective. (I have (c), but haven't PRed it because it was pointed out that it should be done in a more general context, for any affine spaces over normed spaces with strictly convex balls, rather than relying on the inner product.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Affine maps interact with affine combinations as expected (not present, but should be easy). Thus given the values of an affine map on some points, its values on all points in their affine span are determined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any affinely independent spanning set (in an affine space over a vector space) has cardinality one more than the dimension, and in the finite-dimensional case any affinely independent set with cardinality one more than the dimension spans the whole space. (See the recent discussions with Patrick; these results should be derived from the corresponding results for vector spaces.)</p>

<p>My routine was disrupted by travel but I should be back  on this now. My current favorite is "the double dual of a finite-dimensional normed space is itself". Though I presume you mean "is isomorphic to itself"?</p>
<p>Also, would the "permutation group" stuff in "undergrad math missing from Lean" be doable? The topics listed there are : decomposition into transpositions, decomposition into cycles with disjoint support, alternating group.</p>

<p>By the way, I've noticed that it seems the majority of topics listed on that page are definitions not theorems, is that right?</p>
<p>For example, in linear algebra, </p>
<ul>
<li>Fundamentals: direct sum </li>
<li>Duality: transpose of a linear map, orthogonality</li>
<li>Finite-dimensional vector spaces : rank of a set of vectors, rank of a system of linear equations,</li>
</ul>

<p>I can't really comment on this other than to point you toward <code>group_theory.perm.cycles</code>, which contains <code>equiv.perm.cycle_factors</code>, and <code>group_theory.perm.sign</code>, which contains <code>equiv.perm.swap_factors</code>.  I don't know what's entailed for doing symmetric groups.</p>

<p>I think that means the symmetric group stuff is basically done, but the alternating group of permutations of a given set could be defined as the kernel of the sign map, then its cardinality computed (when finite), and results like "the alternating group is generated by 3-cycles" would be great to have.</p>

<p>The way that missing undergrad math page was made was a translation of a french syllabus if i remember correctly, so while the things listed are definitions they are really topic titles I think, so if one makes these definitions I think its implied that we should eventually have all "undergraduate level" theorems about those definitions.</p>

<p>Found the group instance: it's <code>equiv.perm.perm_group</code> in <code>data.equiv.basic</code>.  I wonder if the permutation representation of a group (Cayley's theorem) is already in mathlib somewhere, or the characterization of conjugacy classes of a symmetric group as partitions of n.</p>

<p>I don't think we have either (but I could be wrong about the first one). We have partitions of sets and compositions of natural numbers, but not partitions of natural numbers.</p>

<p>Yes, but I've been advised against starting out with topics that require creating new definitions, hence I stated that.</p>

<p>I think what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="127136">@Alex J. Best</span> was addressing was this question of yours:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The list might be definitions, but I guess the intent is to fill in all of the associated theorems.  For example, the definitions of symmetric groups, cycles, and signs of permutations exist, but mathlib could probably stand to have a lot more textbook theorems about them.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="306601">@Kyle Miller</span> , yes that's how I interpreted it. sorry for being unclear, what I meant to say is: I've been advised against picking topics that require new definitions, and I'm assuming that these topics do require them?<br>
Or are you saying that the fact that the topic says e.g. "transpose of a linear map", doesn't mean that the transpose of a linear map isn't defined? You're saying it could still be the case that these things are defined despite being stated in the list?</p>

<p>I'd like to do Cayley's theorem or "characterization of conjugacy classes of a symmetric group as partitions of n". I've searched mathlib for "Cayley" and Cayley's theorem doesn't seem to be there. Can I just start doing this?</p>

<p>All I know is that <code>perm X</code> has a group instance (I mention where it is a few messages up).  The group <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>S</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S_n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.83333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.151392em;"><span style="top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:-0.05764em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">n</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> would be <code>perm (fin n)</code>.  I'd say just go ahead and try to formalize these things and check in as you go.  (You might try things generally for <code>X : Type*</code> with <code>[fintype X]</code> as needed.  Cayley's theorem can be stated as there being an injective homomorphism <code>G -&gt; perm G</code>, which is true even if <code>G</code> is infinite.  For conjugacy classes, you'll need the <code>fintype</code>.)</p>
