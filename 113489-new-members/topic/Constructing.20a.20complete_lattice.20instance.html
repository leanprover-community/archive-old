<p>Hello, I'm trying to construct a complete_lattice instance for my type.<br>
I have already created instances for linear_order, has_sup, and has_bot (classes which complete_lattice extends), however, it seems that I still need to include these fields inside the complete_lattice instance. Is there any easy way to just specify that the new instance should use the other ones rather than repeating all of the fields?</p>
<p>Also, I am looking at the setoid instance for reference and I don't really understand the syntax near the end<br>

I haven't seen $, ..., or that right arrow carot used anywhere else.<br>
If it's just for ergonomics, I think I'll save wrapping my head around it until I can create a more verbose instance</p>

<p>Ah, I was looking at the online source so I did not have an easy way of finding the definition of <code>complete_lattice_of_Inf</code> it seems that the <code>..</code> syntax is doing what I want to achieve...</p>
