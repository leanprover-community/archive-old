<p>I was looking at tactics. Is it possible to do some unit tests with them?<br>
I know that <code>tactic</code>is defined as <code>interaction_monad tactic_state</code>.<br>
I wish to create some tactic state, run a tactic in it and after, see  the new tactic state.</p>

<p>I don't think you can print the whole tactic state. However, since most tactics only change a few things in the tactic state, you can easily trace those.<br>
You can look at the <code>test</code> folder in <code>mathlib</code> for some unit tests.</p>

<p>I saw how they made some tests. It were really useful.<br>
But it is different of the traditional way of doing test, like <br>
<code>example : double 2 = 4 := rfl</code>.<br>
Because they tested the tactics using it as tactics.<br>
I do not know if it is possible to test tactics in the traditional way.</p>

<p>I don't think I understand what you want, or what distinction you're making between "the traditional way" and what exists in <code>test/</code>.</p>

<p>In traditional way, it is not allowed to use tactics. It would be a function for example: <br>
<code>testTactic (old_state : tactic_state) (Tactic : tactic unit) (new_state : tactic_state) : Type</code><br>
One way of testing it would be for example:<br>
<code>example : testTactic "A -&gt; B" intro "Goal B. H : A" := ()</code></p>
