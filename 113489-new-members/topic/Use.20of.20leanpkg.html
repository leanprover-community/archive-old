<p>Hello, I have just started learning about Lean and I was a little confused about the installation steps. According to <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/toolchain.html#handling-dependencies">https://leanprover-community.github.io/toolchain.html#handling-dependencies</a>, is it correct that we are not supposed to use <code>leanpkg</code> at all, i.e. we should only use <code>leanproject</code>? Or are there certain cases when we would have to use <code>leanpkg</code>?</p>

<p>If you want to use Lean 3 (e.g. if you want to use the maths library) then you don't need to worry about <code>leanpkg</code>, it will all be taken care of by <code>leanproject</code> (follow the installation instructions and you'll end up with <code>leanpkg</code> installed anyway but you won't ever execute it yourself)</p>
