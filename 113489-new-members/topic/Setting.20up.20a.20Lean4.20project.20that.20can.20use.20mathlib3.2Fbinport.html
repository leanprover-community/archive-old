<p>Assuming that you want to work on helping with the porting process, the most important thing atm is to get tactic ported, which doesn't really require <code>mathport</code> or <code>binport</code>.<br>
If you really want to set up the mathport repo, then you'll have to wait for another answer, because I can't help with that.</p>

<p>Ok, totally new here—when you say "get tactic ported", is that one of the by-hand porting projects we need to do for mathlib4? (I'm guessing it's what's going on in <a href="#narrow/stream/287929-mathlib4/topic/Tactic.20porting.20assignments">this topic</a>? Or is my guess off?)</p>
<p>I do want to help with the porting process,  and I'd like to help with porting tactics if I can—it might be a good way to learn! But separately, I'm also just looking to start formalizing some particular math in Lean 4 that will make use of mathlib imports (for which I assume I only need the binaries). (I eventually found <a href="#narrow/stream/287929-mathlib4/topic/using.20binport.20only/near/300929618">this thread</a> and asked a more specific question there after attempting what I could.)</p>
