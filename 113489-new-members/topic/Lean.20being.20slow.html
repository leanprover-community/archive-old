<p>I'm trying to work on a PR in VSCode and for some reason Lean isn't working for me - it just keeps loading. I've tried restarting Lean, switching to master and doing <code>leanproject get-cache</code>,  quitting and reopening VSCode, etc, all stuff that has worked for me in the past. I'm wondering if there is something else I can try before I start looking into whether my computer is causing the problem.</p>

<p>Are you having trouble just in one project directory or does Lean work in VS Code in e.g. another test project?</p>

<p>It works in other project directories</p>

<p>Okay, with the knowledge that it works in other directories, I deleted the repository and re-cloned my branch. It's working now!</p>

<p>I had a similar issue for very long and eventually realised that my Lean folder was in an automatically backing-up location (like Dropbox or Google Drive). That was creating big issues (and was totally stupid, as <code>git</code> ensures all the back-up I need). I don't know if this is the case for you, but give it a look!</p>

<p>Ahhh that might be it, I have my desktop set up to move stuff to my iCloud drive cause I'm constantly running out of storage space lol</p>

<p>I think things like Dropbox can interfere with the way lean decides which files to compile</p>

<p>It's based on when the lean/Olean files were created, I think</p>

<p>Yes, most of the issues came from many <code>olean</code> files getting modified. I realised this when I noticed that a certain point I was committing modifications to some &gt;4000 files, although I had worked on one file only.</p>

<p>As for backups, I REALLY like borg: <a href="https://www.borgbackup.org/">https://www.borgbackup.org/</a></p>
