<p>I am exploring Lean and I was wondering if there are any software verification tutorials, textbooks or reviews/articles that explain how to use Lean in the context of software verification?</p>
<p>I know about <em>The Hitchhicker's Guide to Logical Verification</em>. This is heavily inspired by <em>Concrete Semantics</em>, an Isabelle/HOL book. In turn, <em>Concrete Semantics</em> is a formalization of most material discussed in <em>The Formal Semantics of Programming Languages</em>. This is a classic textbook on semantics, but it is a bit too theoretical.</p>
<p>Coq has <em>Software Foundations</em> and <em>Formal Reasoning about Programs</em>, which are quite practical. They discuss e.g. lots of embedding or stepwise refinement techniques, just to name two things used to verify large software artifacts.</p>
