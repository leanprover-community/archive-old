<p>It seems like a lot of work is duplicated proving theorems between different proof systems. Is it possible to create bridges between proof systems, allowing proofs from one to be used in the other? I can think of two ways this could be done. One would be to make a program that compiles proofs from one language into the language of another, but this may be hard because each proof system organizes its theorems and axioms differently. Another way would be to prove that anything that some other program verifies is true. But maybe this would be just as hard as manually re-proving everything of importance.</p>
<p>I can't be the only one to have this idea, so is there any consensus that this wouldn't work, or any progress realizing this goal?</p>

<p>For example Lean's mathlib is growing rapidly, and we don't care about backwards compatibility at all. If people want to build a bridge to use mathlib in other programs, this must be a royal pain.</p>

<p>(Sorry if this is a very bad question, but) at some level do theorem provers (Lean specifically I guess) manifest some fully inlined verifyable thing, without lots of importing and hopping around? Presumably having some sort of transactable serialized form of that fully verifyable thing is a possible step on this path? Or further, is it a sensical question to ask whether that fully inlined thing could be defined in terms of some intermediate language kind of like bytecode on a VM, and then  at least there's a stabler layer than the "user-facing" mathlib API (or every theorem prover's specific API) on which you can transact across different environments?</p>

<li>Flyspeck (by Hales et al.) was originally spread over three systems. They ended up redoing the Coq parts in HOL4 and never connecting HOL Light and Isabelle/HOL, even though the logics are very close and even though there exists some bridges (including a fast one by Kalizsyk and Krauss).</li>

<p>There's also the following question: Suppose you want to use SomeCoqLib in Lean. Do you want to have a bridge so that you effectively link against SomeCoqLib (just like a Python program can link against a C library) or do you want to port SomeCoqLib to Lean and then modify it in Lean? In the former case, what do you do if you need to generalize SomeCoqLib? Lean Coq? In the latter case, you miss out on new SomeCoqLib features, and you have to deal with the clone -- but at least you can do what you want with it, and make it more native.</p>

<p>One could imagine that different mathematicians have different models of what mathematics is, and write their papers with these models in mind, and yet because of mathematicians' black magic someone who firmly believes that mathematics is built using foundation X (but never talks about this in public) will happily use results which someone proved with foundation Y in their minds as they proved it.</p>

<p>Yes, something like that. I believe your paper that spent 2 years on arXiv before getting submitted was a bit an example of that, where you had to delve deeply into the literature to make sure everything fits.</p>

<p>All of this being said, my main conclusion is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of talking about translation tools, I would propose to first focus on workflow and concrete use cases. Tools can help a workflow. Tools developed without a workflow in mind often end up having zero users (like the many bridges between proof assistants built over the years).</p>

<p>As an example of a workflow, if we had some nontrivial amount of mathematics built using the <a href="http://set.mm">set.mm</a> library as a dependency, then it would help to ensure the quality of the bridge. I think the problem with setting this up is a sort of chicken and egg problem regarding the quality of the bridge</p>

<p>I think this is the right attitude. The real work is the bindings, not the bridge. The bridge can be validated once and for all, for the most part, but the bindings are the alignment of concepts, and this evolves with the libraries</p>
