<p>I would like to use Lean to study HoTT but I was told that I should look into Lean 2. Is that correct? Would you suggest alternatives in order to study HoTT?</p>
<p>Could anyone suggest some good resources (hanbooks,notes, slides or video lectures) to get into HoTT using Lean?<br>
Thank you in advance</p>
