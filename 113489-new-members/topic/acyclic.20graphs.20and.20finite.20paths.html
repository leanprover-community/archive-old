<p>Hello everyone,<br>
Is there something regarding: "an acyclic graph only has finitely many paths from a to b (a and b fixed vertices)" in mathlib? I could not find something useful.</p>

<p>It's got that there is at most one path <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/simple_graph.is_acyclic_iff_path_unique">docs#simple_graph.is_acyclic_iff_path_unique</a></p>

<p>Oh..how could I miss that. I guess because I thought of directed graphs where its not unique and therefore did not have a look at this.<br>
Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="573061">@Christopher Schmidt</span> Just so you know, for simple graphs this is a more complicated theorem to prove because walks are able to travel across edges in either direction. For acyclic directed graphs, I'd take a completely different approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>Show that every a walk <code>p</code> in an acyclic directed graph has <code>p.length &lt; card V</code>. Do it by contradiction: otherwise there is a duplicate vertex in the support, and you can form a cycle.</li>
<li>Reproduce relevant material from <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/1684fd2a39e7a9aa1ba6a2d33ea2751d79fc37f2/src/combinatorics/simple_graph/connectivity.lean#L1590">this section</a> to get finsets/fintypes for all the walks of a given length in a directed graph with a finite vertex set. (Or a locally finite directed graph if you want to do a light generalization -- it's not harder to do this.)</li>
<li>Use 1 to show that the set of all walks between two vertices is finite, since you can take a finite union of finite sets from 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>Amazing, thanks for the idea of the approach! I will give it a shot.</p>
