<p>I repeatedly do one thing that I suspect might be an antipattern. I often need to expand a function (replace the name by its definition in the goal and/or local context) in order to make a certain lemma work. However, the command <code>unfold</code> does not succeed, and I use the tactic <code>change</code> instead. This makes my code harder to write. I assume there is no situation where the command <code>change</code> is really needed. Is there a general advice about something that <code>change</code> can be always replaced by?</p>

<p>It feels like you're missing API.</p>

<p><code>convert</code> is often nicer than <code>change</code>. It accepts also terms which differ from the goal, trying (and often suceeding) to produce "difference goals". Sometimes you end up with 37 goals, showing that you were probably asking for too much. But if it produces only 2 or 3 difference goals, you might be on a good path.</p>

<p>What do you mean by that? Should I add API to my own functions in order to make <code>unfold</code> work?</p>

<p>No, you should API to your own function to not need <code>unfold</code>.</p>

<p>Where can I read about adding API to functions in Lean? I don't have any idea what it means.</p>
