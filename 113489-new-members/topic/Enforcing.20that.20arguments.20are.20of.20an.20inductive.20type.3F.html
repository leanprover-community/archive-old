<p>I've been thinking about using Types to mimic sets. For each <code>set α</code>, we can construct a structure <code>tset</code> with a field of type α and a proof that α is in the set. However, I have run into a problem when defining subsets: what I want is a function <code>subset</code>that takes in two tsets and says whether the first is a subset of the second. Informally, we want <code>subset</code> to be : <code>∀ s : S, ∃ t : T, ↑ s = ↑ t</code>. However, the equality only makes sense if the types of the sets building S and T were the same.</p>
<p>This would be solved if we could enforce that arguments be of a certain type by writing something like :</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>def subtset {α : Type} {S&#39; T&#39; : set α} (S := tset S&#39;) (T := tset T&#39;)  :=
    ∀ s: S, ∃ t : T, ↑ s = ↑ t
</pre></div>


<p>where (S := tset S') is trying to mean that S is an object of type tset S'.</p>
<p>Naturally, this doesn't work. I've also tried type classes, but that failed for me as well.</p>
<p>What is a sensible way to specify that an argument must be of a given inductive type?</p>

<p>In mathlib, there is a coercion from <code>set A</code> to <code>Type</code> that constructs the subtype, so you can wrote <code>a : s</code> if <code>s : set A</code> and it means what you are calling <code>tset</code>.</p>

<p>It's not clear to me what it means for an element of <code>s : set A</code> to be a subset of an element of some other <code>t : set A</code>, because these elements are both just elements of <code>A</code>, which don't have any subset relation between them. Surely you mean to say simply <code>s \sub t</code>?</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>I have not seen the automatic coercion of a set to a subtype in Mathlib. Where can I find the code or a reference explaining it?</p>
<p>I meant for S and T to be the tsets (subtypes), but I guess it was not so clear I was inventing notation.</p>
<p>Additionally, for learning purposes, let's say I want to rewrite that part of Mathlib myself.</p>
<p>Say I have a coercion <code>coer : set → α</code>. For two<code> set α</code>'s S and T, I wish to express <code>S ⊂ T</code> without mentioning the sets explicitly. That is, I wish to construct a function <code>subset'</code> so that <code>subset' ( (coer S) (coer T) )</code> is the Prop that S is a subset of T. However, the arguments to <code>subset'</code> don't make sense if S and T are sets over different Types, so <strong>I want to enforce the condition that my first argument is exactly <code>tset S'</code> for some <code>S : set α</code>.</strong> </p>
<p>In short, my question was: is the above possible? (with direct methods preferred over indirect methods)</p>

<p>No. In Lean two types with the same cardinality are indistinguishable, so for example you cannot even prove <code>nat \ne int</code> and you could not prove that two infinite subtypes of <code>nat</code> are not equal to each other, or to any other countably infinite type.</p>

<p>Well, technically you can assert that a type is equal to <code>tset S</code> for some <code>S : set A</code>, but as Chris says type constructors are not necessarily injective so you can't recover <code>S</code> from this fact, and hence there will be no well defined subset relation on such types</p>

<p>You can just do this:</p>
