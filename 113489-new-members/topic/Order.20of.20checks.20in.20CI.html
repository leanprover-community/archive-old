<p>What's the order in which checks are performed in the GitHub CI?  I ask because I've just had a commit fail CI (on <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/13086">#13086</a>), seemingly because I forgot to provide docstrings for some <code>def</code>s — but this failure only arose after 101 minutes had been spent on the "Build mathlib" phase.</p>

<p>Of course, the linter could become the stricter "has a docstring in the same file", but we don't have infrastructure to run linters in parallel with the build yet</p>

<p>Doesn't adding a docstring for <code>foo</code> just involve a line like <code>add_decl_doc foo</code>?  So you could search the entire codebase for that without having to spend 100 minutes building all of mathlib.</p>

<p>In practice do we add docstrings to declarations from a different file? (Outside of cases where we add docstrings to definitions in the core library perhaps.)</p>

<p>Stuart, you can't tell whether <code>add_decl_doc</code> in the last file is a command or not until you've parsed all the notation up till that point</p>

<p>Obviously I'm describing pathological cases that we don't care about, but hopefully that gives some insight into why it's last fragile to do it a different way to what we currently do</p>

<p>But in the present case the <code>def</code> had no adjacent docstring and there's nothing that could be a candidate <code>add_decl_doc ...</code> in the codebase.  Isn't it worth spending a few milliseconds doing a quick search that will occasionally find a definite failure quickly?</p>

<p>You could have a quick check on your computer, where you grep a couple of lines above every <code>def</code> and make sure that the string <code>-/</code> is present.  Maybe only on the <code>diff</code> with the previous commit or on a single file.</p>
<p>Not a full check, but might catch some actually missing doc-strings.</p>

<p>What I usually do is put <code>#lint</code> at the bottom of the file. It'd be nice if the linters had nicer integration with VS Code, but that's not likely to happen until we port them over to Lean 4.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <em>something</em> has to be checked last. There is no point in cyclically prioritising some check because "it would have caught my error faster".</p>

<p>True but imagine you have two checks that take 1 and 10000 seconds respectively--on average you will be much better off doing the cheap check first, and no one will complain that they had to wait an extra second to get their failure after 10001 seconds.</p>

<p>And moreover every time the cheap check fails that's 10000 seconds of redundant computation that you've avoided, meaning more resources for other users, better scalability as mathlib and its user-base grows, and (as a side benefit) less unnecessarily wasted electricity.</p>

<p>I always feel a small (but surely disproportionate) twinge of guilt whenever I make the CI computers do work needlessly.  If I wanted to get computers to waste power and generate heat for no purpose at all I'd have invested in bitcoin!</p>
