<p>We seem to have two different styles for additivizing docstrings:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="sd">/-- this is `mul_foo` -/</span>
<span class="kd">@[to_additive /-" this is `add_foo` "-/]</span>
<span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">mul_foo</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="gr">sorry</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="gr">sorry</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="sd">/-- this is `mul_foo` -/</span>
<span class="kd">@[to_additive "this is `add_foo`"]</span>
<span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">mul_foo</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="gr">sorry</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="gr">sorry</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Is there any preference between these styles?</p>
<p>The former has the advantage of highlighting like a comment with markdown in vs-code (mainly useful for <code>backticks</code>) and no special escaping needed for <code>"</code>, but the disadvantage of being hard to type and easy to mistype as <code>/- lost "-/</code> which makes it an actual comment that ends up ignored.</p>

<p>Is the voting here about what people prefer personally, or if we think there should be standardization, this is something I don't think we need to worry about standardizing, and indeed have no preference between the two myself. So there is no option for me to select in your poll, I can add a new one of course</p>

<p>(ignoring the question of "is it a waste of time to change this everywhere", to which the answer is certainly "yes" - we could still advocate for one or the other in new code)</p>

<p><del>A vote for both is probably a ok indication of "don't care".</del> Or add a new option.</p>
