<p>I was wondering if Godel's incompleteness theorem has been formalized in any computer logic system, and thought here would be a good place to bring up the topic. I am interested in this because, while I understand the gist of the argument, am afraid a subtle loophole might disallow the self-referential Godel number from existing. I would thus like to see this formalized, though formalizing it myself is currently beyond me.</p>

<p>I've just noticed that the word "constructive" on Freek's site leads to a chaotic neutral domain squatter who sent me to an ad the first time I clicked it, to a bing search for "intuitionism" the second time, and a search for "isa investments" the third time.</p>
