<p>Sorry, I'm not a computer scientist, and I'm trying to write a blog post about induction. Is <code>inductive</code> a "command" in Lean 3? I was hoping I would be able to figure this out from the Lean 3 reference manual, which claims in <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/reference/lexical_structure.html#symbols-and-commands">section 2.1</a> that the built-in commands are listed in section 5 but I can't find the list, unless the list is basically "everything which appears in section 5". I've figured out that <code>#print</code> is a command but right now <code>inductive</code> might be a keyword-like symbol which is not a command as far as I can make out.</p>

<p>I had this exact question recently (though I didn't ask it), but when I couldn't find a formal definition I answered it by cheating and looking at the syntax files for vscode. Not sure that was the greatest idea, but e.g. here for <code>inductive</code>, the vscode extension calls <code>inductive</code> a "definition command", which it seems to want to be a subset of the keywords: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/blob/master/syntaxes/lean.json#L10">https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/blob/master/syntaxes/lean.json#L10</a></p>

<p>(And then it calls things like <code>#print</code> or <code>#reduce</code> or etc. "commands" without the definition qualifier: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/blob/master/syntaxes/lean.json#L28-L29">https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/blob/master/syntaxes/lean.json#L28-L29</a> )</p>

<p>I wouldn't take the names in the syntax highlighting file too seriously; I don't think it follows Lean's "true" grammar particularly closely.</p>

<p>"definition command" is not a term used in the Lean source (except of course for <code>definition</code>). The Lean 4 parser for them, which is part of the <code>command</code> syntactic category, is called <code>declaration</code>: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/master/src/Lean/Parser/Command.lean#L63-L64">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/master/src/Lean/Parser/Command.lean#L63-L64</a>.</p>
