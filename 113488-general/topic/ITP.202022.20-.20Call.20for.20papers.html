<p>The International Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP 2022) will take place on August 7-10, 2022 in Haifa, Israel. It will be part of FLoC 2022.</p>
<p>The FLoC organizing committee will make all efforts possible to ensure everyone can attend in person. However, they are very much aware that there might be members of the community who cannot travel to Israel. In cases where travel is not possible, they will ensure people can participate remotely.</p>
<p>The ITP conference series is concerned with all aspects of interactive theorem proving, ranging from theoretical foundations to implementation aspects and applications in program verification, security, and the formalization of mathematics. This will be the 13th conference in the ITP series, while predecessor conferences from which it has evolved have been going since 1988.</p>
