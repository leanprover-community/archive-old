<p>So the natural number game is doing the rounds again on reddit and the one comment which comes up again and again and which I can't fix is that if people lose their tab, then they "lose their progress". People sometimes don't realise that they can just go to any level at any time, but even those that do feel sad that they lost all their proofs.</p>
<p>I want to start working seriously on the real number game now, and if there is one thing I could change about the infrastructure it would be this. It will be a big change though, I would imagine. I remember <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="132175">@Mohammad Pedramfar</span> saying something about getting people to log in -- but is there some way of avoiding this?</p>

<p>It would be nice to have an idea about how many people played the game, if one can do that without being too intrusive. Could you store something like a hash of the ip when someone completes more than a couple of levels? Then you could count those hashes, without having any mean to reconstruct the ips.</p>

<p>I do know the Xena project blog stats -- it typically gets 100-200 views in a day, except for when something goes a bit viral, when it shoots up for a small period. For example it got 500 yesterday, and it got 3000 on Feb 29 when something (I forget what -- hacker news or something) picked up on a recent post. </p>
<p>If anyone wants to write a guest post or whatever I would be happy to discuss. I have 8 half-written posts which I should probably concentrate on at some point.</p>

I haven't set this one up myself, so I'm not completely sure, but Google Analytics seems to do everything with zero hassle.<br>
All you would need to do is to set up a Google Analytics account and then add the few lines described here to the beginning of the root html file of the game. <br>
<a href="https://moz.com/blog/absolute-beginners-guide-to-google-analytics" title="https://moz.com/blog/absolute-beginners-guide-to-google-analytics">https://moz.com/blog/absolute-beginners-guide-to-google-analytics</a><br>
In fact, if you go to  <em>Lean-game-maker/src/interactive_interface/public/index.html</em> and add the those few lines there, then it will be there when you run the game maker.</p>

<p>Google Analytics gives you detailed statistics of the people who visit your website. And implementing it on my side is not that useful.<br>
If you want to set it up, you would need to go <a href="http://analytics.google.com" title="http://analytics.google.com">analytics.google.com</a>, as described in the link I posted before and set up your account. After that, the only change you would need to do is copying a few lines of code that google gives you and that code contains a unique ID for you. So I can't really make the process easier by changing things in the game-maker.</p>

<p>Oh, no, It's completely independent from everything else in the game. If you want to have detailed statistics, you could implement it. It's probably much more detailed than the statistics that Imperial computing support would give.</p>
