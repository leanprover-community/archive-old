<p>Do you guys think it would be useful to have a post-merge script that posts notifications on open PRs about changes (lines removal only) on <code>master</code> that involve the files the PR is changing or the files that those files import? Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commit &lt;commit hash hyperlink&gt; removed line(s) on the file(s) that are related to this PR.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The biggest is <code>nat</code> lemmas and more generally <code>has_ordered_sub</code> lemmas that got their <code>sub</code> renamed to <code>tsub</code> (for truncated subtraction). There are some more and the best way to be aware of them is to watch the queue, but that's definitely some attention drain.</p>

<p>But your suggestion doesn't fix that anyway. A best solution would be a "What broke" stream where people create topics for what they broke/renamed when they PR and what suddenly got broked in their branch when they merge master.</p>

<p>Just to put this into some context Arthur, you have leapt into Lean in this amazing way, trying to resurrect a stale branch by creating some other branch in some area where other people are working at the same time, are running into all kinds of problems, are gritting your teeth and solving them in this <em>incredibly</em> tenacious way, at a time where the rate of merged PRs is for some reason extremely high. Many of the maintainers and other people writing "competing" code right now are very active on Zulip and if at the end of it you come out unscathed it will be a tribute to both your tenacity and that of the community for helping you through. I have seen many people start on Lean and honestly I don't think any of them <em>started</em> with a project which was so technically complex in terms of the sheer number of issues which you are faced with, and are solving. I would just keep asking questions because in almost every case if you say "look at this branch, this line used to work and now it didn't" you might well get a quick answer from Yael or Kyle or one of the other experts of the form "oh yeah, this happened, fix it like this"</p>

<p>I was initially frustrated with the branch you were working on because it had errors unrelated to what you were doing and I was too lazy to think about how to fix them, but now these are fixed, questions of the form "this line on this branch no longer works after I merged master, help!" will probably be answered effectively -- you have got the community's attention.</p>

<p>It's somewhat frustrating to keep hearing how my branch was broken and had compiler errors -- it would be nice if whomever decides to merge master into someone else's branch would make sure they didn't break anything.  I had a PR in the meantime renaming <code>simple_graph.sym</code> to <code>simple_graph.symm</code> (and similarly for subgraphs), which affects most simple graph branches pre Sep 10.</p>
