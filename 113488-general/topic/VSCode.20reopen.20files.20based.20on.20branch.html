<p>This is not really a Lean question, but is there a way to tell VSCode to remember which files are open based on the active branch ? It's a minor inconvenience, but I find it really annoying to switch files manually when changing branch</p>

<p>Indeed, I used an extension to do this for a while. Unfortunately, it had a habit of causing weird bugs where it would repeatedly open and close files, so I uninstalled it, and I don't remember what I was using anymore.
