<p>Hi all! It's common practice in open source communities to have a code of conduct for participation in the community. GitHub has been <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/community">reminding us</a> for a while that we don't have one. I think it's time to fix this.</p>
<p>We propose adding the following text to the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/meet.html">community page</a> of the website. This is not in response to anything at all, and hopefully we never have to act on it! But I think it's good to establish this proactively. Suggestions are welcome.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Community guidelines</h2>
<p>We are devoted to developing an open and accepting community<br>
that welcomes participation from everyone.<br>
Behavior that is offensive, discriminatory, or aggressive<br>
will not be tolerated in any form.<br>
We adopt the <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/">Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct</a>.<br>
These guidelines apply to the <br>
<a href="">Lean Zulip chat</a>Â <br>
and the <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/">leanprover-community GitHub organization</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="#maintainers">maintainer team</a> enforces this code of conduct.<br>
Jeremy Avigad, Simon Hudon, and Anne Baanen serve as first points of contact<br>
for reporting any concerns.<br>
We also provide an <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdEjlFqJQV65F-yzRHl-lyWAt7TSUW1axPiQK3RyV67iu1h6Q/viewform">anonymous form</a><br>
to report incidents that violate the community guidelines.</p>
<p>We encourage a policy of de-escalation in the presence of unwelcome behavior.<br>
If you perceive someone acting in a way that violates our code of conduct,<br>
please do not respond in the same way; instead, take action to correct the behavior,<br>
such as reporting it to the moderators.</p>

<p>Oops, thanks! That was the "we" in "we propose" :) I don't mean to put words in the maintainers' mouths, but yes, the maintainers are in favor.</p>

<p>I'm bumping this thread just in case there are more comments! I see a lot of <span aria-label="heart" class="emoji emoji-2764" role="img" title="heart">:heart:</span> replies. If nobody wants to add anything more, then we can merge this soon :)</p>
