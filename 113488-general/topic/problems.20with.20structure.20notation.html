<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span> In <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/1259#issuecomment-514792526" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/1259#issuecomment-514792526">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/1259#issuecomment-514792526</a> there are some problems mentioned (by Johannes) with structure notation. I have had these problems as well.<br>
Will those be fixed in Lean 4? Currently this is quite painful, even though structure notation produces more readable code than the anonymous version.<br>
Quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>jcommelin:<br>
I personally find the "named constructor"-version slightly more readable than the anonymous version.</p>
<p>johoelzl:<br>
True, but there are two problems:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>Lean was crashing when writing down the structure syntax (some assertions), and
the auto-parameters took ages to fail
</pre></div>


<p>I can use the structure syntax again.</p>
<p>semorrison:<br>
I tend to:</p>
<p>1. Write out all the fields, filled in with sorry (including the auto_param fields).<br>
 2. Fill in the meaningful data fields.<br>
 3. Try removing the auto_param fields one by one, to see which ones the tactic can handle.<br>
 4. Write any remaining proofs.<br>
It's certainly an unfortunate problem that while the data fields are incomplete or broken, Lean wastes a lot of time running auto_param tactics.</p>
<p>johoelzl:<br>
A third problem I have with the structure notation:<br>
Sometimes I write down {field1 := _, field2 := _ }, but instead of showing me the type of field1, I get a type error at field2. I don't remember if there was a solution to this, was this related to the meta-universe problem?</p>

<p>The structure notation parser is one of the hackiest and messiest parts of the lean 3 parser, and it is responsible for a lot of bug reports. My guess is it's been completely rewritten, and with any luck it's more reasonable now in lean 4</p>

<p>Related to this, I (or someone) should put a test in <code>tidy</code> that fails quickly if it finds a <code>sorry</code> in the goal. I know that the <code>tidy</code> auto_params waste lots of CPU time on goals with embedded sorries.</p>

<p>(This is obviously only relevant while coding, not for library compile times.)</p>
