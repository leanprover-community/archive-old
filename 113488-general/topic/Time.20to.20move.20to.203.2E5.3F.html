<p>I'm wondering what everyone thinks about moving mathlib to 3.5? It seems we've accumulated a fair few small fixes there by now, and it would be nice to have them. (As an example, earlier today someone wanted <code>symmetry at h</code> but had to learn about <code>symmetry' at h</code>.)</p>

<p>There's of course some hassle to move the community to a new default version. But I don't see any reason at this point that we should be fearful of switching to a "community" version; that is, it should be no more intimidating that switching from 3.4.1 to 3.4.2.</p>

<p>I'm guessing that when it becomes time to start thinking about migration plans to Lean 4, it's also going to be useful to have some flexibility on the Lean 3 side.</p>

<p>We talked about this a bit in portland. One thing we have to get right is the lean update pipeline; everyone has forgotten how to do that and unless it's really painless no one will be incentivized to do it and bad things will happen</p>

<p>Are there any backwards incompatible changes that need to be made to mathlib in this instance, I seem to remember mathlib compiling fine with community? The only issue I had was that as olean files are linked to the lean version update-mathlib became useless. It would be good as a first step to compile oleans for community too and make update-mathlib use the ones depending on the lean version.</p>

<p>but I want to restart an update schedule if we start moving ahead with 3.5, and we can't be backward compatible forever (indeed, a lot of the things we want to change are blocked precisely because of backward compatibility)</p>

<p>Related question: Is there any way to get <code>elan update</code> to check and update to the latest commit of 3.5? Running <code>elan toolchain install leanprover-community/lean:nightly</code> each time works well enough, but is less convenient (mainly because I can never remember the precise command).</p>

<p>I think at one point Mario suggested that we remove the version / commit check for olean files from Lean 3.5.0c. It's a tiny change, I could PR it this weekend.</p>

<p>I'm not too hot on the idea of removing that check. The tactics API changes in Lean 3.5.0 so the olean files for 3.5.0 refer to symbols that don't make sense in 3.4.2</p>
