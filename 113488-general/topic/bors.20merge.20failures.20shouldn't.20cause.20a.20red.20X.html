<p>When a batch of PRs fails in bors, it currently puts a red X against all the PRs, even though it's actually just retrying them in smaller batches.</p>
<p>I find this quite annoying, as it makes it hard to tell which PRs actually need attention!</p>
<p>I opened <a href="https://github.com/bors-ng/bors-ng/issues/1227">an issue about this</a> on the bors-ng github repo a while back, but don't appear to have had any traction.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to add their +1 to that issue, please do. :-) (Even more amazing if someone wants to provide a patch. I added a comment on that issue with my best guess of where to start.)</p>

<p>Elixir. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110043">@Gabriel Ebner</span> has gotten a few PRs merged into bors, I think.</p>
