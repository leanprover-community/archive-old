<p>I have some old PRs which no longer have build logs, and the message says that they may have been deleted based on retention settings (which seems reasonable). However, I had one that was built only 10 days ago which doesn't have a log either. Is that really to be expected?</p>

<p>I had this happen to me today (on a PR from this week)</p>

<p>Either way, you can probably just restart the job</p>
