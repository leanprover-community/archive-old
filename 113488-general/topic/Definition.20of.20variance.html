<p>Currently, the variance is defined as the integral <code>ùîº[(X - ùîº[X])^2]</code> so in particular the variance of <code>X</code> is defined to be 0 if <code>X</code> is not L¬≤. I think it might be better to define variance as a <code>lintegral</code> instead since then the variance of <code>X</code> would be infinity if <code>X</code> is not L¬≤. If this were the case, Chebyshev's inequality would remain to hold for L¬π functions . </p>
<p>I came across this while looking at the proof of the WLLN which should hold for L¬π functions but as a result of the above, I can't use the current Chebyshev's inequality directly for it.</p>

<p>It might be annoying to have <code>variance</code> take values in <code>ennreal</code>... <br>
My thought would be: try to change it to be <code>ennreal</code> valued, and if it turns out to make certain arguments harder, then we should consider having both definitions side-by-side.<br>
But that said, I've hardly used the probability theory part of mathlib, so let's also wait for others to chime in.</p>

<p>For Chebyshev's inequality, the RHS has a<code>ennreal.of_real</code>so at least for Chebyshev's inequality it seems natural to define variance to take value in <code>ennreal</code>. Though I can certainly imagine cases where <code>ennreal</code> is annoying...</p>

<p>In probability theory, one uses the variance all the time as a real number (and one only uses it for functions in L^2), so I think it is important that the main definition is a real number. If you find uses for the ennreal-valued version, you can introduce it as <code>evariance</code> or something, of course!</p>

<p>Would it be reasonable to redefine variance as the <code>ennreal.to_real</code> of some<code>evariance</code> defined using a lintegral?</p>

<p>If most useful lemmas remain true, it shouldn't do any harm!</p>
