<p>On <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9080">#9080</a> I get the build failing after 82 minutes, but when I click on "Details", I get a loading symbol next to "leanpkg build". I can watch the loading symbol for a few minutes and it doesn't go away. I merge master and the problem persists. None of the files I edited in the PR report problems (although I did add an import to a file). What could be causing this?</p>

<p>If you scroll down on <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/actions/runs/1764349345">this page</a> it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The self-hosted runner: lena lost communication with the server. Verify the machine is running and has a healthy network connection. Anything in your workflow that terminates the runner process, starves it for CPU/Memory, or blocks its network access can cause this error.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is probably just a temporary issue with the runner. You could try re-running the build and it should finish, hopefully.</p>

<p>Ok, but it's strange that this should happen with two builds in a row on the same branch.</p>
