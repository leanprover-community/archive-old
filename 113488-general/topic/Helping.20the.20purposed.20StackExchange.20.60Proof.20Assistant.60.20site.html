<p>I am posting this in the general stream because Zulip asked if I wanted to notify all 5000+ users, which I obviously did not. Feel free to move this if necessary.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/126242/proof-assistants">site</a> is currently a purposed <a href="https://stackexchange.com/">StackExchange</a> site and a purposed site progresses along in phases.</p>
<p><a href="/user_uploads/3121/V3gpYlXvJozXfD2emCegvLdM/image.png">image.png</a> </p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/3121/V3gpYlXvJozXfD2emCegvLdM/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/3121/V3gpYlXvJozXfD2emCegvLdM/image.png"></a></div><p>To reach the next phase (Commit) as @Andrej Bauer  notes it needs to meet the partially completed requirement - <code>22 more questions with a score of 10 or more</code></p>
<p>One thing many don't realize in the current phase (<strong>Definine</strong>) is that once a sample question gets 10 votes any more votes are basically wasted. Instead vote on questions with less than 10 votes. If and when the site goes live, you can then vote for the question as you normally would at a StackExchange site. You can also change your votes to move the process along in the definition phase.</p>
<p>If and when the site is promoted to the <strong>Commit</strong> phase, users will have to visit the proposal again and commit to using it. This is based on a formula (<a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/53733/181143">ref</a>) and existing StackExchange uses with higher rep who commit are worth more value during the commit phase.</p>
<p>For more details see the StackExchange Area 51 <a href="https://area51.stackexchange.com/faq">FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>This is sort of like studying for the exam rather than to learn the topic; the point in the voting is to establish consensus on what good and bad questions are, not just to progress to the next phase by any means necessary. If a question is particularly good, giving it extra votes above 10 is a good way to indicate that.</p>

<p>Thank's for the support. The proposal is now the most active one in Area 51. Indeed, I think it's better to have a slower proposal procedure that clarifies things than to try to rush through by playing the system and voting for the purpose of getting to the next stage.</p>
<p>Note also that we do not really have enough questions, you're welcome to contribute your own.</p>
<p>P.S. Apologies for spamming 5000+ people in <a class="stream" data-stream-id="113486" href="/#narrow/stream/113486-announce">#announce</a> , this thread is indeed a better place for discussion.</p>

<p>I have heard of two other cases like that.  Martin Escardo says the trick was to follow the advice in the last comment of <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/319150/no-login-found-error-trying-to-log-in-at-area-51">https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/319150/no-login-found-error-trying-to-log-in-at-area-51</a> (which is to click "Sign up" instead of "log in").</p>

<p>I did a bit more digging of what happens to questions during the commit phase. (<a href="https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5278/what-happens-to-questions-posed-during-the-definition-phase-when-a-site-moves">ref</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The top example questions from the Definition phase are listed during Commitment to set the expectation and scope of what this site is about. But these are example questions and they do not automatically get posted to the site. There's more to a good question than a simple title. The folks using this site will ask about actual problems they are trying to solve. The "example questions" are little more than a vague title to help define what the site will be about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In checking an actual site in the commit phase (<a href="https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/126136/substrate?tab=newest&amp;phase=definition#tab-top">ref</a>), all of the questions with 0 or higher votes were listed. I don't know if negative questions existed.</p>
<p>So, learned that it advantages to ask as many questions as possible during this phase even if they gather no positive votes.</p>

<p>FYI </p>
<p>To undo a vote on StackExchange you click on the vote you cast (either up vote or down vote) which undoes the vote. </p>
<p>Many, including me years ago, thought that the way to undo a vote was to cast the opposite vote but this does not undo a vote, it changes a vote.</p>
<p>See: <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/221122/181143">Why is it impossible to undo votes?</a></p>
<hr>
<p>I note this because at StackExchange if you have enough reputation you can click on the vote count as see the individual up and down vote counts and I don't think all of the down votes were meant to be down votes but are incorrect undoing of votes. If this has you confused, welcome to the club.</p>

<p>The <strong>Commit</strong> phase is moving along rather nicely. In particular the number of StackExchange users with 200+ rep is not lagging so far behind the other metrics that it will become an issue.</p>

<p>As you follow along, just mentally replace <em>Ask Ubuntu</em> with the name for  the new site <em>Proof Assistants</em> and it should be pretty much what to expect if and when the site reaches <strong>Beta</strong> phase.</p>

<p>For those familiar with the privileges based on rep on StackExchange sites during the Beta phases the point values are lowered but increase moving forward.</p>
<ol>
<li>Private Beta (<a href="https://cs50.stackexchange.com/help/privileges">ref</a>) - Last about 7 days but may be longer if needed.</li>
<li>Public Beta (<a href="https://genealogy.stackexchange.com/help/privileges">ref</a>) - This can last months to years, it depends on meeting the requirements.</li>
<li>Standard (<a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/">ref</a>) </li>

<p>This really helps those new to StackExchange sites but often comes as a shock when they loose privileges upon entering a new phase because they need more rep.</p>

FYI I am Eric Taucher here and Guy Coder of Stack Exchange sites.</p>
<p>If you want to discuss these in detail I think it would be prudent to wait for the StackExchange site to go into <strong>Beta</strong> at which point it should/will have it's own meta site where such issues can be discussed. Also as this site (Lean Zulip) is not really the ideal place to discuss this as the users of other proof assistants are not represented here.  <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>

<p>Note that this is one of the reasons why the site was proposed in the first place - there is currently no general "proof assistants" gathering place on the internet, although this lean zulip gets a decent amount of general discussion as well</p>

<p>I have to admit I am skeptical of the proposal. SE sites have quite high "critical mass" requirements (I don't necessarily mean Area 51's requirements). To some extent the success of the zulip (and the one for coq) are actually a negative for a stack exchange site, because it would a direct "competitor".</p>

<p>Moreover, I think that for the relevant applications (learning Lean, questions about existing libraries, discussion of related theoretical issues), our present zulip community is just superior to a SE site.</p>

<p>In my mind, the only problem a SE could usefully address is the fragmentation between languages of the Lean and Coq zulips (and, I guess, the lack of good real time communities for other languages?)</p>

<p>The comparative advantage of a SE site over a zulip is essentially that SE can preserve good answers and make them accessible via Google. I'm not convinced we're "answering the same question repeatedly" enough for this to be a critical problem for our current zulip+documentation model.</p>

<p>Even though I am very new here, I'm curious to see how it will evolve. All of it: the concept of "proof assistants", the tools involved and the community. It's reasonable to compare it with the advent of, say, object oriented programming. Things start small, almost as a prototype, and tightly structured. Then eventually it gets to the point that small groups are formed for very specific purposes (like a telegram group for an online course). Nowadays, Python, just as an example, is so big that I don't see a Zulip chat being effective. Julia might have started very small to. Same as Go.</p>

<p>Is the context of this question to suggest that if Zulip did archiving then Google would index the results and thus finding the information from a Google search would be as effective as a post on a SE site?</p>

<p>Since this site (Lean Zulip) has been running fine for the needs of the community, this was not worth noting, but if one is looking at options to make the post more visible then Discourse should be put on the list.</p>
<p>If I seem to skip some of the dots in this please ask, this is everyday knowledge for me.<br>
As I noted on the SE site I admin of a <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a> site with full moderator rights and then some.  <a href="https://swi-prolog.discourse.group/">https://swi-prolog.discourse.group/</a> <br>
We are hosted for free via Discourse as part of the <a href="https://blog.discourse.org/2018/11/free-hosting-for-open-source-v2/">Free Hosting for Open Source v2</a>. What some know but many may not is that Discourse is run by Jeff Atwood, the one who started StackOverflow (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow">ref</a>) and that Discourse sites hosted by Discourse seem to also share the same high ranking of Google pages.  If you search for the word Prolog and some other common tech phrases it is not uncommon to find the pages from the site near the top of the Google search result. </p>
<p>Now for the mines in the minefield. </p>
<p>Our site receives so much traffic that we regularly pass the limit for being free. However another little unknow fact is that if you have an open source project you might be able to have it self-hosted for free at <a href="https://osuosl.org/">OSU/OSL</a> (Oregon State University/Open Source Lab). The <a href="https://www.swi-prolog.org/">SWI-Prolog sites</a> are hosted there as is a contingency site for the Discourse forum.</p>
<p>If as Kevin likes, one wants voting like StackOverflow, this is possible but not with the free site as those are limited to the <a href="https://www.discourse.org/plugins">plugins</a> of a standard account. For more details see: <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/thoughts-on-a-plugin-which-turns-discourse-into-stackoverflow/20763">Thoughts on a plugin which turns discourse into stackoverflow</a></p>
<p>If the site is self-hosted at OSU/OSL then Discourse needs a registered domain name and <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/best-email-providers-based-on-your-experience/93804">email service</a> both of which AFAIK are never free for what is needed.</p>
<p>With my rights on the Discourse site I can see the metrics of which search engines are scanning the site. Todays result</p>

<p>I personally feel like this Stack Exchange site has the potential to draw ordinary computer science users (and students!) into proof assistants and Lean in particular. People  coming from a CS background (like myself!) tend to default to Stack Exchange sites for Q&amp;A and I know it took me a long time to seek out this Zulip and adapt to the more chatty nature of this platform as opposed to Stack Exchange's more FAQ format. </p>
<p>Also, I feel a lot of the coding questions that get asked in the <a class="stream" data-stream-id="270676" href="/#narrow/stream/270676-lean4">#lean4</a> channel would be ripe for such a site.</p>

<p>Some info on committing. One can only commit to three sites at a time. Years ago where there were many new sites that might be a issue and one had to be judicial, now it really does not matter.  I have also committed to a few sites a while ago and then found I did not have the time to devote to fulfill the requirements.  I don't recall it giving me any lasting grief. Also there are several people whom have committed who I am sure have no idea what a Proof Assistant is.  Also be aware that the Sun is rising in the U.S.A and it is a Monday so we might see that last bump in the curve.  <span aria-label="grinning" class="emoji emoji-1f600" role="img" title="grinning">:grinning:</span></p>

<p>That would probably be catastrophic since the language is moving so fast. We really don't want to spend the next 10 years telling people they shouldn't read all those outdated answers.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> That tends to be par for the course for Stack Exchange (in particular, Stack Overflow). I often stumble across answers that are hopelessly outdated. As such, I personally don't find that to be a major con. Also the beta-ness of the system fits well with beta-ness of the site! <span aria-label="laughing" class="emoji emoji-1f606" role="img" title="laughing">:laughing:</span></p>

<p>In the <strong>Private Beta</strong> the rep points are lowered quite a bit, see <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/58587/what-are-the-reputation-requirements-for-privileges-on-sites-and-how-do-they-di/160292#160292">this</a> for details. This allows everyone in the private beta to do things they normally can't like create tags, comment everywhere, edit wikis, down vote, view close votes, vote to close and reopen, ... Also it give StackExchange a look at the community to decide if they should close the site down before making the beta public. So just jump in and take a look. Also questions asked during this period tend to get lots of votes and sometimes never get dethroned, e.g. the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/prolog?sort=votes">Prolog</a> tag has quite a few such questions from the early days.</p>

<p>IMO the speed that went from proposal to Beta would make one of Elon Musk's project look like they were standing still.  If it set a record or is close to the record I would not be surprised.</p>
<p>Many proposals never made it out of the definition phase and many still never made it out of the commit phase. Some lingered for years. Also many sites were attempted, failed and attempted again and again. I think AI and CS went along those lines.</p>
<hr>
<p>Some of the information about the sites is still accessible for reference e.g. the commit graph for the Computer Science site.  (<a href="https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/35636?phase=commitment">ref</a>)</p>
<p>Notice that it took months to get the necessary commits. Also I asked <a href="https://area51.stackexchange.com/users/36671/ken-li">Ken Li</a> who made the successful proposal why he was not more active and he noted that a site for CS had been tried a few times before and noticed that it had not been attempted lately so he just tried and was lucky.</p>

<p>And as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="345260">@Andrej Bauer</span>  noted, he proposed this on a weekend. So most of this was done when many don't visit such sites. I know on the Prolog site I help moderate, the post and replies drop off quite a bit on the weekends.</p>

<p>I did not know one could see a deleted message here.</p>
<p>The reason I deleted the message was because I miss read your question.  I thought it was asking if Q&amp;A from SE could be copied. But upon rereading your statement you were not asking you were stating.  Reading as a question I was responding, reading it as a statement needed no response.</p>

<p>Great question! </p>
<p>Short answer.  I don't know but I don't recall them taking more than a few days to a week.</p>
<hr>
<p>Side note 1: </p>
<p>If the work is being done in the U.S., Thursday is one of the major national holidays (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_(United_States)">Thanksgiving</a>) and many people take the full week off. </p>
<p>Side note 2:</p>
<p>A few hours ago I had actually written that up as question for the SE staff on the Area 51 meta site and was ready to post it when I thought, naw others really aren't that interested as it is just my personal desire, so deleted it.  </p>
<hr>
<p>If you like I can ask the question of the SE staff, or you can do it.</p>

<p>FYI<br>
Based on information from some answers and moderators at SE, the site is expected to go live on a Tuesday, 2 to 3 weeks after meeting the requirements for the <code>Commit</code> phase, which was Monday, 11/22/2021. The notifications for when the beta site is active are sent as an e-mail, makes sense for those joining an SE site for the first time. In researching, SE does not give an expected date because of possible unforeseen circumstances, so no need to look for one. :-)</p>

<p>Regarding Discourse, I am the administrator of the Discourse forum for Coq (and also one of the admins for the Coq Zulip chat BTW). We created Discourse based on the successful OCaml example (and every open source community seemed to adopt this forum at that time) then (more than a year later) we created the Zulip chat based on the successful Lean (and HoTT) example.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as much as I liked the Discourse forum, it seems to have never really took off. Maybe that's because we didn't officially kill the historic mailing list (Coq-Club) that it was supposed to replace in the long term at the same time.</p>

<p>The Zulip chat has been much more successful from the start. It currently has over twice as many subscribers as the Discourse forum. On the other hand, maybe this is partly explained by the fact that you need to subscribe to view the content, whereas you don't need to do this on Discourse... But I think this is also explained by the fact that asking a question in a chat room is less intimidating than asking a question in a forum.</p>

<p>Hi Théo and thanks for the observations! It is interesting that the Coq mailing list is still quite active whereas the Lean mailing list is basically dead (and if anyone asks a question on it, they're just told to go and ask at the Zulip). You might be right about the subscription thing -- I've viewed the Coq Discourse plenty of times without ever making an account there, however I have asked questions on the Coq Zulip, probsably because it was easier to do this than to make an account on the Discourse :-)</p>

<p>Yes this is going more off the topic and with the Discourse thread.<br>
In doing a few private messages with Théo I choose to chat with him on the Coq Discourse site. To sign up I just joined, was prompted with a dialog, since I was already signed into my GitHub account clicked that and was signed up and active on the site. The whole process was faster than me typing this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since we want all proposals to have the best chances of thriving as possible, the Community Team has decided to postpone this proposal's launch into private beta to January 2022, in an attempt to minimize the impact of the upcoming end-of-year holidays in the site's chances of success.</p>
<p>Additionally, the proposal sped through its definition and commitment phases, which we believe hasn't allowed for some discussions that usually take place during those phases — such as deciding on a name and URL for the site — to come to a consensus. As such, we invite those of you who've committed to this proposal to try to have those conversations between now and the first couple of weeks of January 2022. At that time the Community Team will help y'all tie whatever loose ends need to be tied, and prepare the site for launch into private beta.</p>

<p>I'm honestly somewhat impressed at the level of activity so far, and across different communities. I was skeptical initially personally, but hopefully the momentum stays up because if so it seems this'll be a nice resource.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure nominations are shown when they happen. For example, in the recent MathOverflow election, they showed up one at a time. If this didn't happen you could end up with a situation where no one nominates themselves, or, maybe worse, only drastically unqualified users nominate themselves.</p>
