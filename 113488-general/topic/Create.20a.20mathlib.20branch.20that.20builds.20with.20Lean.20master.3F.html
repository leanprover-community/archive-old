<p>Would it be convenient to have a mathlib branch that builds with Lean master? Concretely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new long-lived branch <code>lean-master</code>.</li>
<li>Whenever someone PRs to Lean, they also update mathlib as follows:<ul>
<li>rebase <code>lean-master</code> onto <code>master</code></li>
<li>build <code>lean-master</code> with the Lean from their PR</li>
<li>fix any resulting breakage and push the fixes as soon as the PR is merged</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When a new version of Lean is released, the mathlib update goes like this:<ul>
<li>rebase <code>lean-master</code> onto <code>master</code></li>
<li>'merge' <code>lean-master</code> into <code>master</code> (this is always a fast-forward merge due to the rebasing)</li>
<li>update the Lean version in <code>leanpkg.toml</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>We always have a version of mathlib that builds with Lean master. This is effectively a big integration test for Lean. I've found this very useful while developing my own PRs.</li>
<li>Authors of Lean PRs fix their own breakage, which they are uniquely qualified to do because they already understand the changes. (This also serves as an incentive to avoid breakage. ;)) </li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rebase steps may generate merge conflicts relating to any Lean PRs since the last release. I'm not sure how annoying this would be in practice.</li>
</ul>

<p>That sounds like <code>lean-master</code> is actually ahead of lean <code>master</code>, if it includes PRs</p>

<p>While working on a Lean PR, the PR author would have a local branch, derived from upstream <code>lean-master</code>, that incorporates the necessary mathlib changes. This can be used to locally test the Lean changes. When the PR is merged, these changes go into upstream <code>lean-master</code>.</p>

<p>Can we go even further â€“ what's stopping us from putting lean and mathlib in the same repo?</p>

<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but the purpose of separate repositories is to allow two components to evolve independently.</p>
<p>So I think the first question we should ask, before going into any details, is whether we want this independence.</p>

<p>It's also separating concerns. Fooling around with mathlib is (in my eyes) a lot easier if there is no cpp code around</p>

<p>And there are certainly people using Lean that have no desire to use the maths library</p>
