<p>Did the <code>.lean</code> file permissions change recently for the lean files in the core library?  They used to be "-rw-r--r--", but I think they are now "-r--r--r--".  (In other words, you can know longer modify the files.)  I think this is good because I've accidentally modified such files in the past (and I think it would make sense to do the same for the mathlib <code>.lean</code> files in <code>_target</code>).  However, it also breaks some hacky proof recording stuff I made for lean-gptf.  That isn't a big deal.  I'll fix it.  I just want to understand what is going on here. <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span>.</p>

<p>Are you using elan?  I believe this feature is thanks to the following PR: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/elan/pull/27">https://github.com/leanprover/elan/pull/27</a></p>
