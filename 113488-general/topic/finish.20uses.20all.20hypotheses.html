<p>In the example posted in <a href="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Icc_ssubset_Icc">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Icc_ssubset_Icc</a> the hypothesis <code>hI₁</code> is "unused", except that <code>finish</code> seems to revert and intro back all hypotheses in the context, which makes <code>hI₁</code> occur in the final proof term. Therefore <code>#lint</code> cannot catch the unused argument.<br>
Is there a way to change finish so that it doesn't do this? (I didn't really investigate why finish does this.) Here is a minimized example:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">data.nat.basic</span>

<span class="kd">lemma</span> <span class="n">foo</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">ℕ</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">h</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">5</span> <span class="bp">&lt;</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="bp">≤</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">:=</span>
<span class="kd">by</span> <span class="n">finish</span>

<span class="bp">#</span><span class="n">lint</span>

<span class="c1">-- #explode foo</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I don't think it is worth the effort. I wrote <code>finish</code> in 2016-2017 when Lean's metaprogramming language was still new. It was an experiment to see whether it would be sufficient to implement something like Isabelle's <code>auto</code>. I gave up when I determined that to do it right one would have to implement better low-level matching heuristics and primitives, and that it would have to be in C++ for performance. I was not up to that. I am pleased but slightly surprised that people still find <code>finish</code> useful sometimes, but I still think of it as a failed attempt at <code>auto</code>.</p>
<p>Is the problem specific to <code>finish</code>? IIRC, other tactics (like <code>simp * at *</code>, which <code>finish</code> uses) revert hypotheses and reintroduce them. But maybe <code>finish</code> does it too crudely where other tactics are more intelligent.</p>
<p>BTW, I think it would make a great project to do <code>finish</code> right in Lean 4. Isabelle's internal automated tools, <code>auto</code>, <code>arith</code>, and <code>simp</code>, are incredibly useful. Our <code>simp</code> and <code>linarith</code> are pretty good approximations to Isabelle's, but we have nothing like <code>auto</code>. In Lean 4, we should be able to get something even more performant and flexible.</p>

<p>I'm just getting started on exactly this project. :) (Maybe with a prototype in Lean 3 first.) I'll be giving a talk with some extremely preliminary design ideas -- really more an invitation to discuss the design -- at Lean Together.</p>

<p>After that can you do <code>omega</code> and then <code>groebner_basis</code>? :-)</p>

<p>Jannis, I remember that you expressed interest in this before. I am happy to hear that it's still in scope!</p>

<p>I've already successfully deflected Sander's requests for Gröbner bases. The problem with these tactics is that it would be really hard to dress them up as original research, so we'd need a BSc or MSc to do them.</p>

<p>As for <code>auto</code> in Isabelle, if I understand correctly it is not described properly in any paper (or anywhere), so there is certainly something useful to be written on this!</p>

<p>Yeah, I was told the same thing and haven't found any detailed docs so far. I suspect the type theory might get in the way as well, so I'm not worried about a lack of technical challenges.</p>
