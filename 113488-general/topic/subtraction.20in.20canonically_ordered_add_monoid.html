<p>We have a couple instances of <code>canonically_ordered_add_monoid</code>, like <code>nat</code>, <code>enat</code>, <code>nnreal</code>, <code>ennreal</code>, <code>cardinal</code>, <code>multiset</code>, and almost all of them have a <code>has_sub</code> instance, and lemmas about them. In that case <code>a - b</code> is always the minimal <code>c</code> such that <code>a &lt;= b + c</code>.<br>
I think we should just redefine <code>canonically_ordered_add_monoid</code> so that it extends <code>has_sub</code>, and try to prove as much as we can in full generality, to avoid duplication in every individual instance. <br>
There might be things that depend on the linearity of the order, but I see that we recently got <code>canonically_linear_ordered_add_monoid</code>, so we can prove some lemmas for that class. Side note: <code>canonically_linear_ordered_add_monoid</code> is defined but has no instances. We should upgrade some <code>canonically_ordered_add_monoid</code> instances to it.</p>

<p>I guess it might be worth considering at the same time whether it would be better to have a <code>has_monus</code> or something instead.<br>
Didn't Lean 4 make some change in this area? I forget what it was though.</p>

<p>Is it called monus because Patrick and I moan about it?</p>

<p>Previous discussions about monus where here:<br>

<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/pull/381">https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/pull/381</a><br>
No consensus was reached, but there were proponents of the change and (more?) proponents of the status quo.</p>
<p>I think I'll make this change while still using <code>has_sub</code>.</p>
