<p>Reviewing a PR and I see <code>apply nat.strong_induction_on n, clear n,</code>. This reminded me of some code I was writing last week which had the line <code>apply span_induction hx; clear hx x,</code>. This is perhaps quite a common idiom? The reason one wants to clear the variable is because one is about to embark on a proof or proofs of results related to the original goal and ones instinct is to use the same variable names again -- for example I want to prove results about elements of submodules and I want to use x and y for these elements, so it's annoying if I don't clear the original <code>x</code> which is now useless to me. Is this style OK or is it worth modding some induction tactic to make this happen automatically? I'm not entirely sure what I want here, but given that I've now seen this twice in one week it made me wonder.</p>

<p>I think ssreflect has something for this, a la <code>have {h1} h2 := foo h1</code> which is like <code> have h2 := foo h1, clear h1</code> except it works even if you reuse the variable names</p>

<p>I don't see how we can offer something better than <code>; clear</code> though</p>

<p>in the examples, <code>apply span_induction hx clearing hx x</code> would be no better</p>

<p>fwiw <code>induction n using nat.strong_induction_on with n hn</code> works (does the same as <code>apply nat.strong_induction_on n, clear n, intros n hn</code>)</p>

<p>Yes, I realised when I was posting that I couldn't really see a solution which would be saving too many characters!</p>
