<p>But like you said there are a lot of stacks tags, and there are a lot of contributors here who don't know the project. How do these bursts work? Read all the stacks tags and remember what's been added to mathlib since the last iteration? Or look at a month of mathlib commits and see which ones might have corresponding tags?</p>

<p>Those bursts would have to be done by the algebraists in our community. Look through <code>ring_theory/</code> and <code>algebraic_geometry/</code> for lemmas that don't have <code>@[stacks]</code> but for which you expect that SP will have a tag for it.</p>

<p>Do old tags ever get split? Like, ABC gets expanded and a lemma becomes DEF? That seems like the more likely way for this to happen.</p>

<p>So if there is a split, my guess is that you'll get two new tags, and the old one will be "deprecated" (but still point to the old result, but not show up in their most rendering of the website)</p>

<p>Right, so if ABC is in mathlib and gets split into DEF and GHI, then DEF and GHI are new tags that are likely in mathlib</p>

<p>I think they maintain a list of deprecated tags. So part of a "burst" could be to check against that list.</p>

<p>So I'm not saying "don't do this," just trying to emphasize that this is a sustained maintenance effort that needs someone to lead the charge. Otherwise infrastructure will be built and forgotten and there will be a bunch of incomplete and outdated noise floating around.</p>

<p>Stacks is becoming a canonical reference for commutative algebra for the young -- even the "standard" textbooks like Matsumura and Atiyah-Macdonald seem to be going out of fashion, because Stacks is online and looks beautiful, much better than the dodgy illegal pdfs (sometimes not even OCR'ed) which the UGs have of the classic books.</p>
<p>For me, moving into commutative algebra is a very natural next step for mathlib. Avigad has always pointed out how Lean is really dominating when it comes to algebra. Isabelle is still way ahead on analysis and of course Coq has the odd order theorem, however the odd order theorem is tons of lemmas about finite groups and some basic undergraduate representation theory, and this does not really add new users. If you look at what is coming out way, it's mathematicians appearing out of nowhere saying things like "let's do regular rings" or "let's do flat modules". Stacks is a perfect blueprint for this stuff.</p>
<p>I know the material well enough to even start breaking stuff up into "mini-projects", and I can probably be trusted to be diligent enough to make sure that things aren't broken. Disadvantages: I can't do any computer things. But I think that if the buck stops with me then this will be good enough for me to at least take responsibility for problems.</p>

<p>Another thing I mentioned when we talked about this a while back. This is a big human-curated formal-informal alignment, the ML people here should be drooling at the idea. It would probably be helpful to have a story for <a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/055X">things that don't align perfectly</a> -- humans can adapt easily enough, maybe machines could use something systematic?</p>

<p>I agree that we could try to at least have a bool that tracks whether things "obviously don't line up perfectly". But as you point out, since the definition of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="double-struck">N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{N}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68889em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">N</span></span></span></span></span> doesn't line up, that basically means that almost everything that follows is infected by that virus.</p>

<p>One issue which I discovered recently is that when Bhavik was working on sheaves taking values in a general category, he had to cite things like "Stacks, remark between tag X and tag Y". For me the natural number thing is right now just noise. I know this sounds weird but actually the natural numbers in some sense do not show up much in this kind of mathematics. I took a good look through stacks when this convention was pointed out a few months back, and most of the uses of naturals just seemed to be as an arbitrary countably infinite index set. One of the few times naturals do show up as as dimensions of schemes, and certainly there are 0-dimensional schemes, so all that will be happening is that Stacks will sometimes say Z_{&gt;=0}. We can translate this, as long as I'm overseeing stuff.</p>

<p>I guess we can make PRs to Stacks that add labels to "remark between tag X and tag Y", or rewrite that part of stacks to make things slightly more explicit. My guess is that Johan will be happy to receive such PRs.</p>

<p>We've needed to do a bunch of category theory to get the definition of a condensed abelian group, and people followed the stacks project to do some of this; also commutative algebra is slowly but surely appearing (e.g. we have lots of facts about Jacobson rings and the NSS, with more in the pipeline) so maybe it's time to think about how to actually do this.</p>

<p>If we are going to start doing something at our end, I guess it would be good to know whether you think it might be useful at your end, or at least usable if you want to use it in some way.

<p>I don't quite know what the analogue of a tag is in mathlib, but having a uniform way of saying "this thing here corresponds to tag 0000" should be enough to allow for scraping the source code, and then we can set up a dictionary from that</p>

<p>The easy (from our end at least) kind of "integration" is just cross referencing. For various reasons it seems simpler to store the correspondences on the mathlib side, and then it's very simple to generate a map from mathlib declarations (or files, or locations in the docs) to stacks tags.</p>

<p>I don't think it makes sense to modify the Stacks project in such a way, based on a quickly developing formalisation project<br>

<p>I certainly agree that asking de Jong to change any of the exposition would be a very bad idea. "Can you please split this lemma into two because of some formaliser people" means having to go through everywhere where the lemma is used and understanding the mathematics again and then deciding how to rephrase stuff. I think that we have the flexibility to write our own library so that the correspondence is a simple one-tag-to-many-defs/theorems.</p>

<p>Would it make sense to prove lemmas in mathlib style, and, once a literal stacks statement can be proved, simply add that result in?  In the 17 example above, after the 17 lemmas, prove another one that is simply the conjunction of the previous 17?  This way, we can keep a 1-1 correspondence to something stable...</p>

<p>This is another possibility but, just as the stacks people will not want to change their 1 lemma into 17 lemmas because of the mathlib people, I don't think that the mathlib people will want a conjunction of 17 lemmas just because of the stacks people. Both communities are right now extremely successful in their own ways and one reason I believe for this is the extremely high level of attention which everything gets -- as you will know if you ever tried to PR one lemma and had about 5 people suggesting alternative proofs, putting it in a different namespace, a different file, adding three more lemmas, and actually perhaps completely refactoring something else so your lemma would not be necessary. I think it's best to not try and change either side of things and instead just do the best we can to show that they are doing related things.</p>

<p>An alternative approach is to start a new repo stacks-in-lean which does have these horrendous conjunctions in and has mathlib as a dependency, but for me this seems to be a far more painful solution -- it will need constant maintenance, for example, and in practice if someone wants to see a lemma which really _is_ directly in mathlib (and of course this sort of thing will happen a lot) they don't really want to be sent to some random other repo with mathlib as a dependency.</p>
<p>My gut feeling is that actually one should be liberal here. If there is a tag X in stacks which is mathematically trivially covered by e.g. the union of three lemmas in mathlib then those lemmas should get given the <code>@[stacks X]</code> attribute and also probably docstrings saying what they do in a way which a mathematician would understand.</p>

Mathlib uses a totally different approach so doesn't need to go via L. Nobody wants to see L in mathlib because there is no point. So now we want to tag our lemma L' with both stacks tag X and X', and perhaps explain in a comment or docstring why tag X leads to a proof which is strictly stronger than what is stated in X. </p>
<p>Also it is kind of clear that not all tags need to be formalised in mathlib. There might be useless intermediate lemmas proved in Stacks which are never used again other than in the proof of a bigger theorem, and the mathlib proof of the bigger theorem is different and doesn't go via the lemma. So a naive "we're not done until all the tags are formalised" approach is not right. </p>
<p>For me the main aim is not getting an AI to learn stacks via mathlib, and my impression is that AI stuff is happy to be sloppy anyway (cf Szegedy's comment that he doesn't care at all that the naturals start at 1 in stacks and 0 in Lean because it's all heuristics anyway). For me the aim is to see if this helps with search in stacks, which to be honest I find very poor. Example : <a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/search?query=affine+scheme">where is the definition of an affine scheme?</a> . But maybe this is a lousy example because affine schemes are probably everywhere in stacks.</p>

<p>Kevin, I agree.  I think that being liberal in the referencing is perfectly ok and in fact, desirable.  If a mathlib statement proves a commutative algebra assuming comm_semiring, while the one in stacks is about a comm_ring, I think that it is more than fair that they get the same tag!</p>

<p>It sounds like we came to the conclusion that it is pretty close to a many(mathlib)-to-one(stacks), relationship, but possibly with some exceptions.</p>

<p>I remember in the elementary category theory stuff finding quite a few cases of misalignments, often when mathlib proved "the main part" of a stacks tag but omitted some minor point.</p>

<p>I'd propose that we be open to including these as cross references. Ideally on the mathlib side there will be a link back to the stacks tag along with a note "we don't do part e" or similar.</p>

<p>After the current doc-gen PR is merged, I'm planning to collect all the Stacks tag URLs / other tag-like patterns in docstrings and display those in a special section of the references page.</p>
<p>As I said above, even if we have attributes, we'll still be mentioning Stacks tags in the docstrings, so this effort should be complementary to whatever we decide for the stacks attribute.</p>

<p>In line with this stream, I updated one of my files to add an explicit reference to the Stacks Project.  This is another one of those cases where I proved a part of the statement, but not the whole lemma.</p>

<p>I think that we still need to do some thinking about exactly what data we want to be collecting here. Right now I like Mario's suggestion. I also think that perhaps I was hasty yesterday saying "who cares about the machine learning people, let's just try and make killer search for theorems". I need to spend some time looking at all the examples we have, also also things we don't have but which I would see as minor success stories (e.g. proving some standard theorem about schemes which all alg geometers know, even if it's a standard basic one) and trying to imagine what the mathlib version would actually look like. So my gut feeling right now is just to start off with some detailed notes about what the actual correspondence between the two databases looks like. I am unlikely to find the time to do this before teaching finishes, which is in just under three weeks. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> I think you might have already tried something like this. Is there even some branch, which perhaps was already mentioned?</p>

<p>A bit of a tangential thought: it might be interesting to generate a list of stacks tags that are not formalized, while all the tags they depend on are formalized</p>
