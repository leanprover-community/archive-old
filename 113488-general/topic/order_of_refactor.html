<p>In <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/6587">#6587</a> I am trying to refactor the definition of <code>order_of</code> to make sense of infinite groups. The main file is compiling, but there are two issues that I'm unable to fix. </p>
<p>1) In the file <code>group_theory.perm.cycles</code> the proof breakes because somehow lean doesn't understand that <code>order_of</code> makes sense. It somehow doesn't recognise that <code>perm \alpha</code> being a <code>fintype</code> implies that <code>order_of</code> is well-defined. It gets a bit better if I add <code>haveI := fintype_perm</code> in that the second <code>order_of</code> now makes sense, but the first still doesn't. Any idea why that is?</p>
<p>2) The decidability-classical linter reports two problems in the <code>order_of</code> file, the first is in <code>is_cyclic_of_order_of_eq_card</code>, the second one is in <code>is_cyclic.card_order_of_eq_totient</code>. It reports that I should replace <code>decidable_eq \alpha</code> by <code>classical</code> in the proof. However, if I try that, the <code>refl</code> in the end don't seem to work although at least in the infoview the terms look the same.</p>
<p>Does someone have an idea what is going on in either of these?</p>

<p>You can always try <code>congr'</code> if <code>refl</code> is causing you trouble. This is the problem we see a lot when people try reasoning about finite types. The two ways to fix it are to either become an expert in constructive finiteness or switch to existential finiteness like I do in the fincard branch</p>

<p>Basically I would argue that someone like you would be better off with the hypothesis <code>nonempty (fintype alpha)</code> but then the problem is that some of the theorems you'll need are not proved in this generality, computable versions are proved instead so you have to port everything to a non-computable setting. I think elements of infinite order should have order 0 and one shouldn't even ask for any finiteness hypotheses. Then you prove the theorem saying that g^n=1 iff n is a multiple of the order.</p>

<p>The definition of <code>order_of</code> has two decidability assumptions <code>[Π a : α, decidable_pred (λ n, 0 &lt; n ∧ a ^ n = 1)] [Π a : α, decidable (∃ n, 0 &lt; n ∧ a ^ n = 1)]</code> that should be axed</p>

<p>If you want this to be computable, you should instead have a typeclass <code>has_order_of</code> so that you can supply an implementation and prove it equivalent to the real <code>order_of</code></p>

<p>I don't think you should expose a theorem that talks about <code>nat.find</code> directly as in <code>order_of_of_finite_order</code>; instead expose the definitional axioms of <code>nat.find</code> rewritten for use with <code>order_of</code></p>

<p>There are two things pulling in different directions here. One is theoretical mathematicians like Julian and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="329425">@Peter Nelson</span> coming along and saying "we are finding <code>fintype</code> and <code>finset</code>difficult to use in practice", which can I believe be solved with this finsum approach, and then there's the other extreme where we'd like to be able to show off to the undergraduates by computing the order of some explicit element of S3 using dec_trivial. These are incompatible in some sense -- and I don't think we should be telling newcomer mathematicians that they need to learn all the arcane tricks in order to prove theorems about the order of an element of a finite group. But the <code>dec_trivial</code> proof is not the correct one, we all know that Lean will hang on the dihedral group D37 anyway with this approach. Telling students we can compute the order of elements in S3 but not S8 is not a good look when software like GAP is out there.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> I don't think it was a particular issue with <code>fintype</code> in this case though. It was possible to make it work with some decidability assumption like: If it is possible to decide if the order of this element is finite, then you can use a computable definition. However, as Eric pointed out, there is then a problem with rewrites not working nicely, e.g. lean couldn't figure out that if a has finite order and a=1, then order of 1 makes sense and got stuck. Then I switched to the all-or-nothing approach according to Eric's advice: In practice, probably it is reasonable to ask that finite order is decidable for every element of a group (e.g. finite groups or free groups) rather than just a specific one. But this was also difficult to use (because of too many quantifiers according to Mario). So, now everything is noncomputable and works fine. Lean now reports that there are some unused arguments in <code>dihedral</code>: Since the dihedral group associated to 0 is defined to be the infinite dihedral group, the order of the elements can be given uniformly without assuming finite dihedral group, i.e. n&gt;0.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="317890">@Julian Külshammer</span> yes this exactly the problem with <code>fintype</code> -- rewrites don't work nicely (experts can often work around individual problems). This is what the noncomputable approach solves in a far simpler way, by removing the issue completely.</p>
