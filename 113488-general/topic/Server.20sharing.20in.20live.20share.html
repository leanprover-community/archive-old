<p>I’m not quite sure what server sharing is, but I believe Gabriel said that one can’t make two concurrent calls to the info command in the lean server.  If one does so the first call is cancelled or something when you make a second.  Is this an issue with this feature?</p>

<p>Reading the live share documentation, they say that there are two kinds of extensions: project-specific extension (which are run on the host), and user-specific extension (which are also run on the guest).  Project-specific extensions can be "shared", so that they are only run on the host.  The lean extension would need to be a project-specific extension that is shared.  But I have no idea how to configure that.</p>

<p>It seems from Bryan's experiment (that I have confirmed) that it works reasonably well out of the box --- as long as you don't need any imports!</p>

<p>I had some very vague thoughts on how to proceed. First, I'd like to check this further, but from my brief tests, it seemed like all the behavior on the guest's side in the editor window (that is, decorations, hovers, code actions etc.) seem to work fine, presumably because these commands are sent to the host's computer, processed there and then transmitted back somehow. (This may be using some "project-specific extension" functionality.)</p>
<p>Assuming that's true, then the question becomes how to handle the info view. Again, here I'd like to understand better what's going on in the current state of the extension, but I believe the infoview on the guest's computer is working with a "copy" of the edited file in the Lean server launched on their side. This Lean server seems to not be picking up any <code>leanpkg.path</code>, so it's probably defaulting to the global one. </p>
<p>If that's the case, then my thought was that we could pop up a prompt for guests to specify a path to a Lean project on their computer to give to their Lean server. We could use <code>leanproject</code> to allow guests just to specify a github link too.</p>
<p>Lots of ifs and open questions here, but those were my thoughts. If anyone wants to do testing along these lines, that'd be greatly appreciated. I was just going to put lots of <code>console.log</code> in the extension source and then build a .vsix and try to run both guest and host on my laptop.</p>

<p>I read that the hovers are run on the host somewhere (probably in a live share github issue?) and now I can't find it. I think the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/reference/extensions#known-issues">Known Issues doc</a> hint at this though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Guests receive the language service results from both their local extensions, and the host, and therefore, if both participants have the same language service extension installed, guests will see duplicate entries for certain things (e.g. auto-completion, code actions)</p>
