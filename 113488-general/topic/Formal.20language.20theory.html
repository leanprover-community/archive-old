<p>Rather out of curiosity: Does there exist work in Lean about formal language theory? So stuff like grammars, automata, turing machines etc. I've looked around a bit on the Internet but didn't really find anything but I'm guessing if there is something I missed out on people here will know about it.</p>

<p>There are also DFA, NFA and language files in the <code>computability</code> directory (you should be able to navigate to them from the link above using the menu on the left).</p>

<p>Yeah <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="267202">@Fox Thomson</span>  has done a bunch of this.  He's currently on an internship doing Isabelle, but might be worth reaching out!</p>

<p>I've been working on regular languages and finite automata but unfortunately haven't had time for it recently. We have all the definitions and a proof of the pumping lemma but there's still work to be done. The next big milestone is showing DFA's and regular languages are the same thing.</p>

<p>Yeah I saw those TODOs in the regexp file, I would definitely be interested in working at that or maybe Pushdown Automata which are still missing as far as I can see but I wouldn't consider my Lean good enough (yet) to work on something like that.</p>
