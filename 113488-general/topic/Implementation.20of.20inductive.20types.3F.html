<p>New to Lean and CoC/DTT in general (would it be better to post in <a class="stream" data-stream-id="113489" href="/#narrow/stream/113489-new-members">#new members</a> ? The description looked like it was for personal introductions.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm having some trouble understanding what the inductive type syntax actually does in terms of the most fundamental parts of CoC. Through some partial examples in the earlier parts of the Theorem Proving book, it made sense how the following could be used to axiomatically define what a boolean is:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">constant</span> <span class="n">my_bool</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span>
<span class="kn">namespace</span> <span class="n">my_bool</span>
<span class="kd">constant</span> <span class="n">true</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">my_bool</span>
<span class="kd">constant</span> <span class="n">false</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">my_bool</span>
<span class="kd">end</span> <span class="n">my_bool</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Following up with <code>#print axioms my_bool.true</code> prints out the two axioms it is dependent on. In contrast, I've seen <code>bool</code> be declared as follows:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">inductive</span> <span class="n">bool</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span>
<span class="bp">|</span> <span class="n">ff</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">bool</span>
<span class="bp">|</span> <span class="n">tt</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">bool</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This requires no axioms, which is what's confusing me at the moment. The Theorem Proving book has a chapter dedicated to this, but it seems focused on descriptions of what inductive types can do and how they can be used. Is there some way I can see what this syntax represents, or is it an extension of CoC which cannot be expressed as more verbose components?</p>

<p>Constants and axioms are discouraged because they might add inconsistencies into the system, eg there are none in mathlib. Making bool as an inductive type ensures that the system remains consistent.</p>

<p>The inductive construction does exactly what your constant approach does, but also adds a final constant <code>bool.rec</code> giving you a method to define a function on <code>bool</code></p>

<p>However it is an acceptable approach because the constants that <code>inductive</code> adds are guaranteed not to add an inconsistency to the system</p>

<p>The thing you don't know with your constant approach is that to define a function on <code>bool</code> it suffices to give its values on <code>true</code> and <code>false</code></p>

<p>Lean's foundation is a variant of what is known as "the calculus of inductive constructions." Inductive types are built in, so, in a sense, so they are just God-given (or Leo-given) constants and axioms. But, as Kevin says, it is better to stick to the foundation than to extend it on your own.</p>

<p>Thanks, it makes more sense now. I think I got a bit confused having read about the Calculus of Constructions and thinking it was the system Lean is built on, I'll look more into that.</p>
