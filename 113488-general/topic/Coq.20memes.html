<p>I asked a whole bunch of serious number theorists how much they would care if a team of computer scientists announced tomorrow that they had fully formalised a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, and the sup of the responses I got was "epsilon".

<p>I think that an issue is the fact that if you've discovered a new proof, it would take far less time to write it up as a pdf than in lean (unless you're sufficiently well trained in lean). And people still trust PDFs (at least I do) - especially if they're written in latex!</p>

<p>Somehow imo there are two kinds of mathematicians - ones where "proof comes first" and others where "ideas come first". You'll often see proof people get bogged down in annoying details that many people won't care about, and you'll often see ideas people wave their hands about and claim certain things to be true that may not be convincingly so. </p>
<p>I believe that lean has the potential to unify these two seemingly opposite mentalities. Ideally we would get Lean to the point where an ideas person could prove a theorem by "waving their hands within lean" and lean would have good enough tactics to complete the proof. Something like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>theorem riemman_hypothesis (whatever) :=
begin
*waves hands in lean and lean works out the uninteresting details*
end
</pre></div>

<p>Although thinking about this, I am having doubts. Is this really the ideal? What if lean works out a lemma that is actually fairly interesting? Then because it was only used in aid of this one theorem, no human will look into it or investigate it. Is this mathematical progress? What is progress? Also, we want the computer to generate proofs that are human-like - proofs that resemble a human's thought process. Do we actually want this though? I can imagine this being a contentious issue in the future.</p>

<p>As I've said several times before, "Appel--Haken II: computers return" is when a computer belches out a one million line long piece of OCaml code claiming to be a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis, and it's completely non-human-readable but it typechecks.</p>

<p>At one point I was probably the best 5x5 dots and boxes player on the planet but sometimes I would agonise for three or more hours over a middle-game move just thinking "I would like to force a win from here, but this is such hard work to analyse, at this stage it is clearly a job for a computer"</p>

<p>And another really funny thing about that paper is that I have never met my co-author. We have played dots and boxes against each other online and at some point I realised that he had a brilliance which I lacked. And then he emailed me saying he was a schoolkid and could he do a school project with me on dots and boxes and I said "yeah alright"</p>

<p>On the topic of a million line ocaml proof of the RH - I'm not sure if I would accept that. Clearly, I'm an undergraduate and so I wouldn't understand a written proof of it anyway, but there's some sense in which a _wrong_ proof with good, enlightening, ideas is better than a _right_ proof that doesn't bring anything new to the table. In my opinion, I would prefer no proof at all rather than such a million line proof.</p>

<p>If such a million line proof arises, then I think that the job of the pure mathematician would be to figure out the good ideas that came into the proof.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>this seems like a good description of what a pure mathematician might be good for in the future, but it also raises the old question of "if nobody really understands a whole proof, is it really a proof?". By nice compositionality stuff, we could maybe show that it's enough to understand little bits of the proof and how the little bits fit together, but I don't think it's impossible that a computer could produce a proof which was in no way compositional (i.e. it was just one long meandering thread that couldn't be split into nice little segments)</p>
