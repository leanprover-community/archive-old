<p>So I read <a href="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2020/07/05/division-by-zero-in-type-theory-a-faq/">https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2020/07/05/division-by-zero-in-type-theory-a-faq/</a> and inspired by this I decided to try it out on some of my research. In particular, I'm formalizing some results in partial actions. I defined a partial action as something that has an instance of the following:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="sd">/-- Typeclass for partial scalar actions. `smul_defined a x` means that `a • x` is defined. -/</span>
<span class="kd">class</span> <span class="n">has_partial_scalar</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">M</span> <span class="n">α</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span><span class="bp">*</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="kd">extends</span> <span class="n">has_scalar</span> <span class="n">M</span> <span class="n">α</span> <span class="o">:=</span>
<span class="o">(</span><span class="n">smul_defined</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">M</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">α</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="kt">Prop</span><span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>After working out some of the theory, I introduced a bug in one of the proofs where I showed a filter converging to a • x and I had forgotten to check that a • x is defined. So it seems that this approach is liable to introduce bugs in proofs, which is what I wanted to avoid.</p>
<p>At this point I'm thinking of defining partial actions as functions of type <code>M → α →. α</code> again. I had tried this approach before, but it introduces a lot of inconveniences, especially when dealing with filters mapped by such actions.</p>
<p>I was wondering if there is a way to salvage the first approach to prevent subtle bugs from not checking that a • x is defined.</p>

<p>This is an unpopular opinion but I think the totalization approach is bad for situations involving a variable, largely undetermined function (like an action of a monoid on a set). It makes sense for specific functions like <code>x / y</code> or <code>deriv f</code>.</p>

<p>Ah, I never thought about that.</p>
