<p>I have a mutual inductive definition for a PL semantics:  a rather natural way to do this. It works well, but the definitions (which I'm moving from Coq) are rather complicated and so I have some test code. #eval and printing things fails because writing instances of the has_repr type class has failed due to it not taking a mutual keyword also.  Am I missing a keyword to make these? It would also be very nice if we had a command that just generated these, perhaps represent?</p>

<p>Don't use mutual inductives in Lean. They work only very superficially; the problems you're seeing are only the tip of the iceberg. For instance, termination checking with mutual inductives is unreliable as far as I recall and Lean doesn't generate good induction principles for them.</p>
<p>(For what it's worth, I'm not sold on the utility of mutual inductives even in languages where they work, like Agda. In my experience, if you mutualise a central inductive type, you also have to mutualise basically every definition, which gets old quickly.)</p>

<p>What is the alternative? I have the same issue as Brian.</p>

<p>Ideally, I think, reformulate your syntax so that it isn't mutually inductive any more. This may come at the cost of additional boilerplate, e.g. duplicated constructors, but I find that less painful.</p>
<p>If there is no acceptable formulation without mutual inductives, I guess you'll have to bite the bullet. I would then try to prove a custom induction principle and define any functions/proofs in terms of that. You might want to do the translation into a non-mutual inductive type yourself rather than letting Lean do it, since then you can at least see clearly what's going on. But I don't have experience with this in Lean, so take my opinions with a big grain of salt.</p>
