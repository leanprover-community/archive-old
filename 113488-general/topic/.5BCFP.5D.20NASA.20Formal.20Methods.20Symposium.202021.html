<p><strong>The Thirteenth NASA Formal Methods Symposium</strong><br>
<a href="https://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/nfm2021/">https://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/nfm2021/</a><br>
               24-28 May 2021<br>
              Norfolk, VA, USA</p>
<p>The symposium will be held in an in-person/virtual hybrid format in<br>
Norfolk, VA, USA, possibly transitioning to fully virtual depending on<br>
the COVID-19 situation.</p>
<p><em>Theme of the Symposium:</em><br>
The widespread use and increasing complexity of mission-critical and<br>
safety-critical systems at NASA and in the aerospace industry require<br>
advanced techniques that address these systems' specification, design,<br>
verification, validation, and certification requirements.  The NASA<br>
Formal Methods Symposium (NFM) is a forum to foster collaboration<br>
between theoreticians and practitioners from NASA, academia, and<br>
industry. NFM's goals are to identify challenges and to provide<br>
solutions for achieving assurance for such critical systems.  New<br>
developments and emerging applications like autonomous software for<br>
Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), UAS Traffic Management (UTM), advanced<br>
separation assurance algorithms for aircraft, and the need for<br>
system-wide fault detection, diagnosis, and prognostics provide new<br>
challenges for system specification, development, and verification<br>
approaches. Similar challenges need to be addressed during development<br>
and deployment of on-board software for both spacecraft and ground<br>
systems.  The focus of the symposium will be on formal techniques and<br>
other approaches for software assurance, including their theory,<br>
current capabilities and limitations, as well as their potential<br>
application to aerospace, robotics, and other NASA-relevant<br>
safety-critical systems during all stages of the software life-cycle.</p>
<p>The NASA Formal Methods Symposium is an annual event organized by the<br>
NASA Formal Methods (NFM) Research Group, comprised of researchers<br>
spanning six NASA centers. NFM2021 is being organized by the NASA<br>
Langley Formal Methods Team.</p>
<p><em>Topics of Interest:</em><br>
We encourage submissions on cross-cutting approaches that bring<br>
together formal methods and techniques from other domains such as<br>
probabilistic reasoning, machine learning, control theory, robotics,<br>
and quantum computing among others.  Topics of interest include, but<br>
are not limited to, the following aspects of formal methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advances in formal methods:</li>
<li>Formal verification, model checking, and static analysis techniques</li>
<li>
<p>Theorem proving: advances in interactive and automated theorem<br>
    proving (SAT, SMT, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Program and specification synthesis, code transformation and generation</p>
</li>
<li>Run-time verification</li>
<li>Techniques and algorithms for scaling formal methods</li>
<li>Test case generation</li>
<li>Design for verification and correct-by-design techniques</li>
<li>
<p>Requirements generation, specification, and validation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integration of formal methods techniques:</p>
</li>
<li>Use of machine learning techniques in formal methods</li>
<li>Integration of formal methods into software engineering practices </li>
<li>Integration of diverse formal methods techniques</li>
<li>
<p>Combination of formal methods with simulation and analysis techniques</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formal methods in practice:</p>
</li>
<li>Experience report of application of formal methods in industry</li>
<li>Use of formal methods in education</li>
<li>Verification of machine learning techniques</li>
<li>Applications of formal methods in the development of:<br>
     - autonomous systems,<br>
     - safety-critical systems,<br>
     - concurrent and distributed systems,<br>
     - cyber-physical, embedded, and hybrid systems<br>
     - fault-detection, diagnostics, and prognostics systems<br>
     - human-machine interaction analysis</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Important Dates:</em><br>
Abstract Submission: 27 November 2020<br>
Paper Submission: 4 December 2020<br>
Paper Notifications: 19 February 2021<br>
Camera-ready Papers: 19 March 2021<br>
Symposium: 24-28 May 2021</p>
<p><em>Submission Details:</em><br>
There are two categories of submissions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Regular papers describing fully developed work and complete results<br>
   (maximum 15 pages);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Short papers on tools, experience reports, or work in progress with<br>
   preliminary results (maximum 6 pages).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The submitted papers should not exceed 15 pages for regular papers and<br>
6 pages for short papers, including tables and figures, but excluding<br>
bibliography and clearly marked appendices.  The papers should be<br>
self-contained, as appendices will not be included in the published<br>
proceedings.  In addition to appendices, authors are encouraged to<br>
make available any other supplementary material supporting the claims<br>
made in the paper, such as proof scripts or experimental data, as the<br>
availability and reproducibility of these artifacts may be considered<br>
by reviewers in scoring.  All papers must be in English and describe<br>
original work that has not been published or submitted elsewhere.  All<br>
submissions will be reviewed by at least three members of the Program<br>
Committee in a single-blind reviewing format.</p>
<p>Papers will appear in the Formal Methods subline of Springer's Lecture<br>
Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) and must use LNCS style formatting<br>
(<a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>).<br>
Papers must be submitted in PDF format at the EasyChair submission<br>
site: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nfm2021">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nfm2021</a>.</p>
<p>Authors of selected best papers will be invited to submit an extended<br>
version to a special issue in Springer's Innovations in Systems and<br>
Software Engineering: A NASA Journal<br>
(<a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/11334">https://www.springer.com/journal/11334</a>).</p>
