<p>I hereby write to you to invite you to sign up for an account on Codewars: <a href="https://www.codewars.com" title="https://www.codewars.com">https://www.codewars.com</a> </p>
<p>Codewars is a training platform where programmers of all disciplines train on code challenges called Kata in order to improve their programming skills, <strong>and we are now extending our invitation to pure mathematicians interested in computerized theorem proving</strong>.</p>
<p>The Lean theorem prover was recently added to Codewars (approx. April 2020), with 11 theorem-proving challenges (3 approved, 8 still in Beta) at the time of writing. Note that Lean support on Codewars is currently in the <em>alpha</em> stage, i.e. it is very much experimental for now and things (e.g. challenge setup, execution time limit, etc.) may change in the near future, so <strong>we are primarily looking for (moderately) experienced Lean users interested in trying out our platform to join at this stage</strong>, i.e. if you are a beginner just started with learning Lean then you may consider joining later (e.g. on a second invitation to be determined in the near future) for an optimal experience.</p>
<p>Once you sign up for an account on Codewars, feel free to try out <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/lean?q=&amp;beta=false" title="https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/lean?q=&amp;beta=false">our current list of approved Lean challenges</a> (3 at the time of writing), known as <strong>Kata</strong> on Codewars. Approved Kata are challenges that have already passed the quality-checks and scrutiny of the community and therefore should be of high quality.</p>
<p><strong>But more importantly</strong>, please also consider trying out <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/lean?q=&amp;beta=true" title="https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/lean?q=&amp;beta=true">our current list of Beta Lean Kata</a> (8 at the time of writing) if you've tried out the approved Kata and enjoyed the experience you had so far. Beta Kata are challenges contributed <em>by the community</em> that have yet to pass the quality-checks and scrutiny of the (rest of the) community. In order for Beta Kata to leave Beta, they have to be completed by other members of the community and receive a certain number of satisfaction votes and rank assessments.</p>
<p>After you've tried some of the approved and Beta Kata, given that you are satisfied with the overall experience, <strong>please do consider authoring Lean Kata of your own to contribute back to the community</strong>. This could be something simple like an extension to one of the levels in the <a href="https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/" title="https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/">NNG</a> or something more challenging such as proving that all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipschitz_continuity" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipschitz_continuity">Lipschitz functions</a> are uniformly continuous (or even perhaps landmark results in complex analysis (for example)!). Your Kata will then pass through the Beta phase and (hopefully) eventually get approved as with every other Kata.</p>
<p>To learn more about the Lean environment on Codewars, please refer to <a href="https://github.com/codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Language-Lean" title="https://github.com/codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Language-Lean">the Wiki entry</a>. You can also learn more about the <a href="https://github.com/codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Kata-Beta-Process" title="https://github.com/codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Kata-Beta-Process">Beta Process</a> here. And last but not least, feel free to drop by <a href="https://gitter.im/Codewars/codewars.com/" title="https://gitter.im/Codewars/codewars.com/">the Codewars Gitter chat</a> if you have any questions or would just like to discuss about Codewars in general.</p>
<hr>
<p>For more computer-science oriented Lean users, you may be delighted to know that Codewars also supports Coq, Idris and Agda (support is pretty much stable) as well, with over 40 approved Kata and 20 Beta Kata spanning topics in discrete mathematics, programming language theory, verified functional algorithms ... If you see a (Coq / Idris / Agda) Kata that you would fancy being made available in Lean as well, feel free to leave a comment on the Kata concerned and we'll see which ones we can make available in Lean. <em>Alternatively</em>, <strong>if you happen to do Coq / Idris / Agda as well then feel free to (first) complete said Kata in one of those languages and submit a Lean translation to the Kata author, which, once approved, will make the Kata available in Lean for everyone</strong> <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-263a" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>

<p>OK so (a) you can use mathlib [I just added the imports to the submission file] and (b) I just solved the first kata :-) I am now 7 kyu at Lean :P</p>

<p>I didn't look at any wiki pages, I just got going. Maybe it's a good idea. Sometimes mathlib comes as standard and sometimes it doesn't -- see for example the community web editor v the official one</p>

<p>Probably a good idea to mention the specific version (git commit id) of mathlib installed somewhere though, since it won't always be the current one</p>

<p>Donald kindly added two number theory Kata which I suggested; they are currently in beta but you can still submit solutions. One of them is probably harder than the three non-beta kata. Note that no discussion of the problems should occur here; you can only see the full discussion about a problems once you've solved it on the site.</p>

<p>These all look like mathematics, in some sense. Kenny's kata is of a similar nature to these. Our joint kata about units in rings is mathematics of a different nature (and probably much harder) but my gut feeling right now is to get as many kata into the system and then promote it.</p>

<p>I think that independent of translating Kata we should be also thinking of cute little maths problems, of all levels, and formalising them. There is essentially no risk of them being duplicates as far as I can see, because most languages on the site do not support proofs, and those that do seem to have Kata which are mostly on the programming side</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110064">@Kenny Lau</span> I assume you mean the link to your published translation? The answer is: you can't. If I click on the link to view the translation then I can see the changes you made to the description, the Preloaded section, Initial / Complete Solution and Sample / Submit tests immediately, since (ideally) I have to review the translation before approving / rejecting it. Of course, once I click on the link to view the translation, I immediately forfeit the Kata, at least in the language of the translation and IIRC also in all other languages as well (that's why I asked everyone to mention which Kata it is for when posting links to translations).</p>

<p>I've been bugging my fellow moderators to approve Lean translations for the following 5 Kata (all over a week old), so hopefully they will be available in Lean pretty soon:</p>

<p>Still bugging my fellow moderators to approve them, but one of them said that the one for "A + A = B + B" should be rejected (and frankly I agree with him) since it's too easy in Lean even for <code>6 kyu</code></p>
<p>On the other hand, good news: <a href="https://gitter.im/Codewars/codewars.com?at=5e909ee71aaf8e4b8e740ebc" title="https://gitter.im/Codewars/codewars.com?at=5e909ee71aaf8e4b8e740ebc">a respectable Codewarrior has just declared his interest in learning Lean</a> so he might start contributing to Lean development on Codewars in the near future</p>

<p>Huh. This is an exercise in Mac Lane and it looked useless enough so I thought it might be a cool kata which will never find its way into mathlib, but now I looked it up in Borceux and he writes "The following result is obvious, but will prove to have interesting consequences" and he uses it at least five times in the rest of volume 1 of his handbook. So I guess this really will be a mathlib PR at some point. On the other hand, this is so easy that I don't think it would be a problem for the kata if the answer was in mathlib.</p>

<p>I have no experience in these matters. Oh but there are now 11 out of beta? That seems like a far more respectable amount than 3 :-)</p>

<p>So I'll take that as a "yes"? <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-263a" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span> </p>
<p>IMO it does not really matter if most of Lean kata are currently in Beta. As long as we remind fellow Codewarriors to leave their satisfaction votes and rank assessments on every beta kata they complete then we should have many more approved Lean kata very soon.</p>
