<p>While doing the <code>gsmul</code> refactor, I encountered a completely mysterious behavior in one file (may I say bug here?). I worked around it, but now that everything is merged people may have a look for fun. On current master, open the file <code>measure_theory/arithmetic.lean</code>, and go to line 311. Replace this line</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code>  <span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">exact</span> <span class="n">has_measurable_gpow_aux</span> <span class="n">G</span> <span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>with its proof</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code>  <span class="o">{</span> <span class="k">assume</span> <span class="n">k</span><span class="o">,</span>
    <span class="n">simp_rw</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">gpow_neg_succ_of_nat</span><span class="o">],</span>
    <span class="n">exact</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">measurable_id.pow_const</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">k</span> <span class="bp">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">))</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">inv</span> <span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>It fails. The line <code>simp_rw</code> is not doing its job: it doesn't change anything. You can repeat this line as many times as you want, they don't fail, but they don't change the goal. Whatever I tried, I wasn't able to close this goal without using an auxiliary lemma. I guess something is messed up with the tactic state at this point, but I can't tell what (nothing looks suspicious even with <code>pp.all</code>).</p>
