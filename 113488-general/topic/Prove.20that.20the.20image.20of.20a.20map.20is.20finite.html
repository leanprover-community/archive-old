<p>Hello,<br>
I'm relatively new to lean (I learned about lean a year ago, I did the natural numbers game, but only started to use it more seriously the last week).<br>
So I thought a good starting project would be "a cont. bij. map from a compact space to a hausdorff space is a homeo".<br>
At the moment I have a mostly working proof of "compact subset in a hausdorff space is closed", but I'm stuck at the following problem:</p>
<p>(To remind you, the proof is roughly the following: Let A be the compact set, let x  be a point not in A, for every point in A choose a neighborhood disjoint to a neighborhood of x, get a finite subcover, and use the intersection of the corresponding neighborhoods of x as open nbhd of x disjoint to A)</p>
<p>So I have the finite subcover of A, and I built a "function" of the following type:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">have</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="bp">Π</span> <span class="n">u</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">subcover</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">nhds_of</span> <span class="n">X</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="bp">|</span> <span class="n">p.1</span> <span class="bp">∩</span> <span class="n">u</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="bp">∅</span> <span class="o">},</span> <span class="kd">by</span> <span class="bp">...</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>(for every open u in the subcover, we get a nbhd of x, which is disjoint to u)<br>
Then our finite set of nbhds of x would be the range of this subcover, this works.</p>
<p>Now I have trouble showing that the range is finite.<br>
I used <code>finite_image</code>, but this does not work, because the function's domain is not the Type set X, but a subtype of it,<br>
for it to work, one apparently needs a function <code>set X -&gt; set X</code>, and then it gives you that the image of <code>subcover</code> is finite.</p>
<p>So I built the following "workaround":</p>
<p>I defined a function<br>
<code>  let tempfun : set X → set X := λ u, if hu : u ∈ subcover then (f ⟨u, by assumption⟩).1.1 else ∅,</code></p>
<p>Then I proofed that  the image of <code>subcover</code> is finite by using <code>finite_image</code></p>
<p>First question: Can we avoid this weird workarounds?</p>
<p>Second question: Later I need to use that <code>tempfun u = f (&lt;u, hu&gt;)</code>, (where <code>hu : u ∈ subcover</code>),<br>
which should be a trivial proof, but I don't know how to do it.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!<br>
Apologies if these questions are dumb or obvious, but I searched the web for quite a while and found nothing helpful :(</p>

<p>To be precise in the second question: I made a mistake, I want to show <code>tempfun u = f (&lt;u, hu&gt;).1.1</code>. which gets the underlying set of the neighborhood with the condition that it is disjoint to u.</p>

<p>I think you'd be a lot more likely to get help with an <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mwe.html">#mwe</a>, it's difficult to solve "how do I do this trivial proof" questions without having exactly the same set of lean-based hurdles in front of us as you do.</p>

<p>I proved compact subspace of a Hausdorff space is closed using this "classical" approach in one of my Twitch streams over the summer: the code is <a href="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/Example-Lean-Projects/blob/master/src/topology/twitch.lean">here</a>. I wrote a lot of comments. In mathlib they give a completely different proof using filters.</p>

<p>Ok, yeah looks like a great idea to make a mwe :)<br>
So it would be the following code:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">topology.basic</span>

<span class="kd">end</span>

<p>And thanks, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> , I will look at your code!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="385865">@Klaus Mattis</span> that code snippet is a bit "too minimal". Please include <code>import foobar.quux</code> in the code snippets, so that people can copy paste them into a new file and immediately have compiling code.</p>
