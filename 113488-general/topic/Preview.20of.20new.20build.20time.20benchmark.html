<p>At Rob's request, I'm setting up a new build time benchmarking server that'll hopefully be a little more consistent than Scott's bot. You can see its measurements at <a href="http://mathlib-bench.limperg.de/">mathlib-bench.limperg.de</a>.</p>
<p>At the moment, the thing is very bare-bones. If you have any additional features you think would be useful, that's what this thread is for! In particular, Scott's bot generates a lot of profiling output; if you need that, I can probably set it up.</p>
<p>One thing I'll certainly improve: the server doesn't benchmark every commit, so the time difference is not "time difference caused by this commit" but rather "time difference caused by all commits since the last commit we benchmarked". This needs to be clearer in the UI.</p>

<p>An advanced feature: it would be really great if we could trigger a benchmark build from a PR with a comment on GitHub. The GitHub side is easy enough to do with an action.

<p>a couple minor suggestions. first, i suggest measuring the time change not from the previous build, but from the average of the previous 10 builds. right now the chart shows three "outlier"-colored listings, when really what happened was that a couple consecutive runs were a bit off in different directions. none of those are really time outliers</p>

<p>second, i suggest putting a time on each row for when the snapshot of the repo was taken - it's easier to reason about "oh the problem started yesterday morning, hmm" rather than "oh the problem started at diff 62b3"</p>

<p>The HTML report is gorgeous!<br>
I'd really like to see more detailed profiling output, that is, runtime per file. (I believe Scott had that.)  Ideally there'd be a nice table where you could see how the runtime of each file changes between mathlib commits.</p>

<p>These are four threads on E4as_v4 VMs. In my tests, these were the VMs that introduced the least variance.

<p>Currently changes of more than +/- 3% (actually 2.65% for reasons) are marked red (worse) or green (better). It looks like the VM/Lean/OS introduces about this amount of error.</p>

<p>I think the main issue with consistency is just using a VM for benchmarking. there will always be some contention with whatever else is using the machine. but, it's way better than nothing! i just wouldn't worry about much optimization work on benchmarking consistency as long as it's on a VM, I would not be surprised by random 10-20% fluctuations that are entirely out of our control</p>

<p>Julian, thank you for the benchmarking notes. I'll go through them to see which parts are applicable.</p>
<p>Wrt noise, the VM is certainly not great and any micro-optimisations to reduce noise will likely be a drop in the bucket. But it's not horrible either. I did an experiment where I built the same commit 30 times and the biggest deviation from the mean was 3.4%. Standard deviation 49s, which is 1.5% of the mean. So the bot can't detect small optimisations/regressions, but bigger fish will show up.</p>

<p>so, the way VMs are typically inconsistent is based on how other people are scheduled around you. if your VM is co-scheduled with a bunch of light users, performance will look pretty stable, but at any time the cloud provider may reallocate resources, you find your job is coexisting with a heavier user, and performance is lower. it is possible to have a situation like, performance seems totally consistent for a week, and then is 20% lower the next week, while you make no changes. measuring a low standard deviation won't really capture that. all this is not to say this is a bad idea, but to point out for future consideration that an apparent large performance regression on a VM is a "necessary but not sufficient" condition for an actual performance regression <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>

<p>That's fair. We'll have to see what the numbers look like over longer periods of time.</p>

<p>Kevin, since you seem to know something about this: we have ~$10k credits on MS Azure and are projecting to use ~$300 for olean serving, which is why we went with this setup for benchmarking. Do you know if there's a way to do more reliable benchmarking using Azure?</p>

<p>We don't need perfect reliability and Jannis' setup is a clear improvement over what we had before.</p>

<p>But it's quite possible there's a better approach using the same resources and we're just not aware.</p>

<p>I think it's a good idea to keep this running. Just don't be surprised if half the time, when it looks like things got slow, actually it was just VM flakiness</p>

<p>Have you tried profiling instructions instead of wall-clock time, using e.g. <code>perf stat</code>? It doesn't measure the speedup from parallelism, though.</p>

<p>No; in fact I've never used <code>perf stat</code> before. Are these numbers useful? If they are, I can report them as well.</p>

<p>They should be pretty much proportional to task-clock time while being less noisy, so they could be a strictly better regression indicator; I've never benchmarked on a VM, however.</p>
