<p>Also do you happen to be behind some proxy of a company/university/w/e that might be intercepting your traffic via a self signed certificate?</p>

<p>I downloaded and installed elan manually and fortunately it works. It works without setting the unknown environmental variables manually. (Certficates and its expiry dates are horrible.)</p>

<p>As a general warning, if your response to SSL issues is to ignore them and download things without SSL, then an attacker can get what they want (in this case, installing arbitrary software on your computer) simply by serving you a bad certificate so that you give up and override SSL manually.</p>

<p>I can't tell if that's actually what you did from your message, but someone else reading it might think it's fine to do that, and it's not.</p>

<p>What's the solution if the computer refuses the download because the software vendor's certificate is out of date? So we cannot install Lean.</p>

<p>The software vendors certificate is not out of date, as evident by everyone else that is using elan on a daily basis to fetch the latest nightly. The issue is with your system either being configured or (in the malicious cased) tricked into accepting certificates that are out of date. Now what exactly the issue is with your system configuration is hard to tell without looking into the details of which certificates it is using and from where they are coming from.</p>

<p>I'm only a typical computer user (here: WINDOWS). I don't know anything about certficates and how they are controlled. Certificate problems are common and typical today.</p>

<p>Yeah they are very much uncommon if your system is setup up correctly, hence why someone should probably take a look at it :P</p>

<p>Note that since you're seeing the issue with <code>curl</code> and github, this isn't a lean or elan problem; you would likely do better to ask for help elsewhere; <a href="http://superuser.com">superuser.com</a> <em>might</em> be appropriate, as might a local IT office at your school / workplace if this windows device is used for education / work.</p>

<p>Are you running a very old version of Windows? I wonder if all the certificate problems you are seeing have something to do with the Let's Encrypt root certificate expiration from several months ago.</p>

<p>If you're ever wondering whether a server is having SSL issues, <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/">https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/</a> is another good first place to go. You put the domain in and it will give you a second opinion on whether other computers agree with you on the certificate issue.</p>
