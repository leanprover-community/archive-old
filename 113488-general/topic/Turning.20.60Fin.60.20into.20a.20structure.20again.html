<p>As some of you might have noticed, in Lean 4 <code>Fin</code> is a structure.  Just like it was in Lean 3 before Johan PRd <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/pull/452">lean#452</a>.  However there are now good reasons to make <code>Fin</code> a structure.  For example, Leo plans implement some compiler optimizations for <code>Fin</code>s that would not be possible with the subtype definition.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the structure definition has lots of other advantages.  For example, the unifier won't reduce <code>Fin n</code> to <code>Subtype (· &lt; n)</code> and then try to unify the less-than function (and its type class instance).  The difference between <code>Fin.mk</code> and <code>Subtype.mk</code> disappears.  And the cases tactic produces <code>Fin.mk</code> instead of <code>Subtype.mk</code> (as it does now).</p>
<p>A big reason behind Johan's change was that we could reuse API for subtypes.  From what I can tell, we have since added lots of API around <code>function.injective</code> and <code>function.embedding</code> which works for general subobjects and not just literal subtypes.  This seems to significantly reduce the pain points mentioned by Johan.</p>
<p>I have tried out changing <code>fin</code> into a structure again in mathlib, and it requires <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/compare/finstruct?expand=1">only very little change</a>.  The biggest one is the <code>locally_finite_order</code> instance which unfortunately doesn't generalize to <code>function.injective</code> (as it requires a computable inverse).  Are there any objections to change <code>fin</code> to a structure?</p>

<p>No objections for me. You've made a strong case for the change.</p>

<p>The fix you introduced for the <code>locally_finite_order</code> instance looks good to me, so no objection.</p>

<p>It looks like the documentation still says : <code>fin n is the subtype of ℕ consisting of natural numbers strictly smaller than n</code>. Even though that isn't how it is defined.</p>

<p>Maybe we should just copy the Lean 4 docstring (authored by Mario):</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="sd">/--</span>
<span class="sd">`Fin n` is a natural number `i` with the constraint that `0 ≤ i &lt; n`.</span>
<span class="sd">It is the "canonical type with `n` elements".</span>
<span class="sd">-/</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Although the <code>0 ≤ i</code> is a bit redundant for a natural number..</p>

<p>Shouldn't it say "a term of type <code>Fin n</code> ..."?</p>
