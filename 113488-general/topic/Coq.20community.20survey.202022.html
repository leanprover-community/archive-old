<p>There might be still valuable feedback as to why you've switched to Lean (as so did I).<br>
They also ask about feedback on a name change, and I was eager to support that <span aria-label="upside down" class="emoji emoji-1f643" role="img" title="upside down">:upside_down:</span></p>

<p>we consciously constructed the survey so that it can be responded to even if someone doesn't use Coq (although with many fewer questions, and hiding questions about "other proof assistants"). But here I was indeed trying to reach people who tried Coq in the past and switched to Lean, or are using Coq in parallel with Lean. Those Coq+Lean users can be explicitly tracked in the survey data, and aggregate information about them may be of interest to the Lean community.</p>

<p>in my view, someone that only tried Coq for as little as a few weeks would still be eligible to answer, though. There is no requirement to "try hard" to use Coq to count as a Coq user to us.</p>

<p>I think this is one of the most telling observations! Did you ask any questions of the form "are you a constructivist"? I suspect that you might get very different answers again in the Lean/Coq communities. I've told this story many times before, but in 2017 I was genuinely of the opinion that constructivism had died out; I had <em>no idea</em> it was alive and well in CS departments; that's how seriously the concept was being taken in all the maths departments I've worked at.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> I think many modern “constructivists” aren’t holding a die-hard philosophical position on what basic facts of math are true, but are just intellectually interested in constructive mathematics in the same way you are in algebraic geometry and set theorists are interested in set theory.  (Constructive math has a lot of applications to classical mathematics and computer science.)  so I don’t know the term “constructivist” is that useful anymore.  The question should just be “do you research (or are you interested in) constructive mathematics”?</p>

<p>I'm not a bonafide constructivist or intuitionist, but what is nice about constructivism is that I don't need a different language to describe computability, which can be important in many CS applications. Larry Paulson mentioned the "synthetic" approach to computability theory that this has spawned as a nice application of constructive type theories in his blog post here: <a href="https://lawrencecpaulson.github.io/2022/04/20/Why-constructive.html">https://lawrencecpaulson.github.io/2022/04/20/Why-constructive.html</a></p>

<p>In principle I very much agree with Jason's comment. But one should keep in mind the practical effect for formalization. We've seen with mathcomp and mathlib that it is very hard to make a library which is both classical and constructive. Hence even if you don't have a "die-hard philosophical position", the effect is the same: it seems any big library has to strongly impose one side.</p>

<p>if anyone caught the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ak3N31d8_g">recent presentation by Gonthier</a>, he mentions mostly practical concerns (rather than philosophical aims) in creating MathComp. So the axiom-freedom of the core MathComp libraries may be mostly due to minimalism and design concerns (axioms don't compose well in Coq, library developers adding one axiom constrains what axioms library users can add)</p>

<p>I agree with Patrick that in a given project one has to make a choice if one is going to be careful or carefree about axioms, and maybe that could be another question on the survey.  (Also with the recent interest in univalent mathematics, it gets subtle since one could be “carefree”, but in the sense one does freely uses univalence and HITs, although I’ve yet to see a library freely using univalence, HITs, LEM, and AC.)</p>

<p>The slides seem to imply that there was a survey in 2014. Did some of the questions coincide and, if so, were there any interesting changes between 2014 answers and 2022 answers?</p>

<p>Some obvious things: </p>
<ul>
<li>we have significant share of people from industry now</li>
<li>VS Code shows up and becomes popular</li>
<li>relatively more Mac users back then, Linux more popular now</li>
<li>tactic language explosion, SSRreflect gets many users</li>

<p>Mostly speculation, but I think Linux share can be used as a proxy variable of sorts for share of "CS-oriented users". My impression is that the more math-y you are [as opposed to CS-y], the higher the chance of being macOS user.</p>

<p>so maybe a stereotypical proof assistant user starts as a Windows user at UG level, then branches into macOS or Linux, depending on disposition (and there is likely a large number that just stop using proof assistants and continue to use Windows)</p>

<p>I'd find it interesting to see some graphs on how some of these answers correlate, e.g are people using different extensions of the standard library only using one, or mixing multiple? Or how do different research interests correlate with choice of tactic language used. Is such data available and would it be possible to include in upcoming posts?</p>

<p>we have the raw data to study such connections, yes (but not at a deep level, only based on people selecting multiple libraries, tactics, etc.). There may be additional blog posts where we show "intersections" like that, I'll pass on the idea</p>

<p>modules are (arguably) mostly used for hiding contextually-irrelevant definitions and results. I believe Lean has some namespacing feature that does something similar? The Coq module system is like modules in languages like OCaml and Standard ML</p>
