<p>I want to write a math lecture note, and make use of Lean. I find that the Jupyter notebook is an interactive notebook, I prefer that way. <br>
So is it possible to embed Lean into Jupyter notebook, Just like Lean game maker(Lean game maker is good, but I don't think it's proper to write formal lecture)? Or are there other interactive notebooks support Lean?</p>

<p>It's possible in principle, but no one has written a Jupyter kernel for Lean yet. I've experimented a little bit with Lean in <a href="https://observablehq.com/@bryangingechen/hello-lean-prover?collection=@bryangingechen/lean">"Observable notebooks"</a>. </p>
