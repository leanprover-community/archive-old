<p>When I use the finite_dimensional definitions and lemmas in mathlib, even just in statements, they seem to work very slowly. Specifically I'm asserting things like finite_dimensional (degree_lt F t). It's honestly annoying enough that I think I'm going to have to find another way around it... anyone know what the cause might be?</p>

<p>Could you post a <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mwe.html">#mwe</a> for people to have a look at?</p>
