<p>You may have noticed CI errors related to "API limit exceeded." Our current hypothesis is that this is due to the dependent-issues action behaving inefficiently when a PR is merged and it needs to update <code>blocked-by-other-PR</code> tags.</p>
<p>The sync-task-issues action, which checks off dependencies in a PR message once they're merged, does almost the same thing but more efficiently. It should be fairly easy to <a href="https://github.com/jonabc/sync-task-issues/blob/8dda495be473d369c79f4161b0279b163933d333/src/sync-task-issues.js#L68">modify the script</a> to also add/remove labels when appropriate. </p>
<p>Is anyone interested in trying to do this? We could run a fork of this action, but if polished enough, I suspect the sync-task-issues maintainer might be interested in a PR.</p>
