<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>this message is about Git-iquette.  Throughout the morning, I have been producing several (very short) PRs:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7866">#7866</a> -- approved, thanks Johan!<br>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7868">#7868</a><br>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7870">#7870</a> -- approved, thanks Johan!<br>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7871">#7871</a> -- introduces a new lemma<br>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7872">#7872</a><br>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7873">#7873</a></p>
<p>The main reason for these PRs is to shorten PR <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7645">#7645</a>, by reducing the number of touched files.</p>
<p>My question now is if this is good or bad behaviour!  My instinct is to bundle together tiny changes into a bigger one, but I am slowly getting accustomed to the practice of producing several small, incremental changes.</p>
<p>Please, feel free to tell me whether these PRs are ok/silly, and whether I should continue/stop with them!</p>

<p>I think short PRs like that are a very good idea. You should just make sure that they are compatible, i.e., that they don't create conflicts between one another.</p>

<p>SÃ©bastien, thanks for your support!  The PRs are certainly independent among them (unless I am mistaken, they only change <em>proofs</em> of existing lemmas/instances, with possibly one exception that introduces a new lemma).  I have been consistently merging them back into their bigger brother and fixing conflicts, when they arose.  So, hopefully, I should be ok from that point of view!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="321459">@Damiano Testa</span> Yes, I think splitting into small PRs like you did is a good move</p>

<p>Great, thank you all for your support!</p>
<p>If/when these PRs will be merged, the number of touched files by PR <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7645">#7645</a> should decrease by ~8, I think!</p>

<p>While many small PRs sometimes feels frustrating, because there is some extra time overhead in CI, fixing merge conflicts, and so on, I think this is more than made up for by the fact that it's so much easier to give useful reviews on focused PRs.</p>
