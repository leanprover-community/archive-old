<p>The CI linter noticed unused instance arguments in my <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8251">latest PR</a>, but typing <code>#lint</code> in the file locally didn't show up the problems. These were duplicates of instances introduced by a previous <code>variable</code> declaration.</p>
<p>Am I using the linter incorrectly?</p>
<p>Edit: follow-up question: can one run the linter on a file or project as a stand-alone command from the terminal?</p>
<p>Anyway, once this (and any other issues that arise in the review process) is fixed, we should have Bessel's inequality. Thanks to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="260507">@Heather Macbeth</span>  for suggesting the problem and for helpful advice.</p>
<p>The only thing I'm suspicious of is that I didn't need to use completeness of the inner product space.</p>
<p>Edit: for the past 1hr19 minutes, it has been my birthday.</p>

<p>I don't know the answer to the question about the linter, but regarding the mathematical question -- I guess it's enough that the scalar field <code>ùïú</code> (which is <code>‚Ñù</code> or <code>‚ÑÇ</code>) is complete!</p>
