<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="123965">@Bryan Gin-ge Chen</span> in your version of the web editor, is it possible to get only tactic state and not all messages?</p>

<p>There could be a switch somewhere, but it should also be configurable in the url, so we can link to tutorials having the expected behavior (or else make that behavior the default one)</p>

<p>I want to be able to post a theorem from my algebraic geometry course as something that people can play with using the Lean web editor. My problem is that I want to post a super-non-intimidating-for-mathematicians file, which needs some other imports in the repo which are of a far more CS nature. Basically I only want the students to see the interface. I don't have time with mathlib PR's for this stuff, my code works fine for me and I'm sure it's not mathlib-ready. One cheap fix, however, would simply be to cut and paste all the imported code used above the code I want them to see, in one big file, and then put the "imported" code into some invisible box which is not displayed on the web editor. Line numbers will be weird but I don't care. Can this be done?</p>

<p>You'll have to do something a little bit cleverer than that if you want the user to be able to use <code>import</code>, since as you describe it the <code>import</code>s won't all be at the top of the actual file that Lean sees, then</p>

<p>Doing this with the community web editor would definitely require modifying the editor code. My impression was that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="132175">@Mohammad Pedramfar</span>'s  code for the natural number game supported something like this though. </p>
<p>I'll see if I can cook up an Observable notebook later tonight.</p>

<p>There will be no import in the user's code. It will just be a one-off file to experiment with so that people can compare the Lean proof to the maths proof without having to install Lean. Bryan -- yes you're right, I could definitely do it with the Lean game maker. Maybe this is easiest!</p>

<p>Having failed to install lean on 3 different systems, I turned to the Lean Web Editor, as mentioned in TPIL. Is there a page that says how to use it? I want to create a variable of type Integer, which seems to need \mathbb{Z}, but I don't know how to type it. Sigh.</p>

<p>Note that just running "<code>lean</code>" from the command line doesn't return any output. You can run <code>lean -h</code> instead to see the basic command-line help string. However, you most likely don't want to use lean solely from the command line. Instead, lean should usually be used interactively in conjunction with either VS Code or emacs. It looks like mathlib's <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/install/project.md" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/install/project.md">"Creating a Lean project" doc</a> assumes you want to use VS Code.

<p>Indeed lean is a C++ program. The installation procedure is to go to the <a href="https://leanprover.github.io" target="_blank" title="https://leanprover.github.io">official website</a>, search for a link called Download, then a link called binaries and click on the link relevant to your platform on <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/releases/tag/v3.4.2" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/releases/tag/v3.4.2">https://github.com/leanprover/lean/releases/tag/v3.4.2</a>. Then you need to know how to unpack a zip or tar.gz archive on your platform. Was that the blocking step?</p>

<p>Or maybe you mean that you didn't only want the Lean C++ program but also a lot of user-friendly supporting tool? Then you'll indeed need an editor, probably also an editor plugin talking to Lean. Maybe you also want to use Lean libraries created by other people. Then you'll need to download that as well, but this requires reading a bit more documentation, and maybe use python tools to make it easier. Then indeed you depend on quite a few packages, but only the Lean binaries are Lean itself.</p>

<p>Ok, for background, I've been programming for 50 years and an open source lead developer since 1997. So, 'tar' isn't the issue.I've been using emacs since the late 70s so I have a 'user-friendly supporting tool'. For Axiom installs you only need to type 'apt-get install axiom' and then 'axiom'. Or, if you prefer, there is a Docker version of Axiom. All of the documentation is in PDF.  I hardly know how to make it easier.</p>
<p>The usual game is to 'git clone the repo and type 'make' to get a useful system. The tar-make path leaves me with 3 binaries. The ./lean binary appears to do nothing. So I followed with a Google search, found the PPA extensions for apt, did the repo-setup / apt update, and the apt-get. But the PPAs appear to be unsigned so apt is unhappy. Similar losses on Mac and Windows (and Windows WSL). The Google search did not show me the 'wget' link. Being a trusting soul I executed that command sequence and (almost) got a useable system (modulo the emacs/vscode issue). I was just astonished at the number of packages, including whole languages like python, got installed.</p>
<p>Somehow Lean can talk to the vscode editor, can accept input, and show output. But apparently this won't work from the command line (or I'm just being too slow to understand). On Unix systems one tends to expect that programs accept stdin and write to stdout so that all of the other tooling 'just works'. Is there a way to point it at a file and just get the output?</p>
<p>Obviously, my mindset is the problem. To use Lean effectively I have to adopt a whole new tool chain. That is going to make it very painful to package and ship it as part of Axiom. I need things like test automation during build so proofs are checked at build time. I need the proof-checker available as a separate tool. I need to integrate the lean system with the Axiom command line so you can #check, for example.I realize, coming from the "other side" of computational mathematics, that I'm not the usual lean customer. Nevertheless, I feel it is important to merge Lean and Axiom seamlessly.</p>
<p>Rather than complaining, is there a way I can help?</p>

<p>The first "tooling" of interest would be a way to take an input file and "compile it" to a fully elaborated proof that only needs the proof checker (no libraries, no tactics).The proof checker should accept that "compiled form" and accept or reject it.</p>

<p>I do agree that using and installing Lean is very different from other apps.  Part of this I think is that while lean is a compiler (and can compiler programs from the command line), its interactivity is what is more important.  If you just want to check/compile a lean file from the command line, you can use <code>lean my_lean_file.lean</code>.  However, Lean has no REPL.  It does however have a server <code>lean --server</code> which can be used to communicate with it interactively by a machine.  (It is unusable by a human directly.)  I think this is how emacs and vs code communicate with Lean.  The server is really designed for interactive and incremental checking of a lean file while it is being worked on and hence is frustrating to use for direct communication.  However, some have been able to make Lean communicate with external processes that aren't editors by using the Lean server.  For example, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110596">@Rob Lewis</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110187">@Minchao Wu</span>  have built a <a href="https://robertylewis.com/leanmm/" target="_blank" title="https://robertylewis.com/leanmm/">bi-directional connection between Lean and Mathematica</a>.</p>
<p>I'm also building a small python prototype which I'm using to communicate with Lean directly for the purpose of machine learning.  I'll put that on GitHub in a few days.</p>

<p>To be clear, I think none of us think that installing Lean is as easy as it could be.  And using Lean from an external application is a huge pain.  I think the official word from Microsoft research is to wait for Lean 4.  (And they won't let you make any changes to Lean directly except in your own fork.)  However, I think as a community we can find work arounds and better documentation for Lean 3.</p>

<p>The way I am using the Lean server (and I imagine how Rob and Minchao are also doing it) is to send a JSON sync request to the server and then wait not only for the response to that request, but also an "all_messages" response which contains any compiler errors.  The round trip takes about 0.1 seconds which is pretty slow IMO.

<p>I built programs for Microsoft in the past. I used a commercial program that built ".msi" files (if memory serves) that could automatically install all of the programs in the right place. My customer set (Intel and Police) just wanted "point and click" installs. I'm surprised that a Microsoft-related Lean program doesn't have this tooling. In addition, the documentation had a LOT of pictures (about 2 per page) along with a lot of "click on the blue box now".</p>

<p>re: the MMA-Lean link... why would you need to translate "x^2-2*x+1" into fully elaborated code? You have systems on either end that can parse expressions. I'm rewriting the Axiom system to accept / produce Lean proofs at the user-level source code.</p>

<p>Axiom should store fully elaborated code that a proof checker can check. But that is never user visible. It is only used when the Axiom "Oracle" wants to supply an answer to Lean (e.g. a GCD result) so Lean can trust the answer.</p>

<p>From my little experience, the usual Lean output is not easy to parse by a machine.  However one can write a custom parser for expressions, which is what they do.  They could have made it more generic (like s-expressions or JSON), but I guess they wanted to directly put the AST into Mathematica code.</p>

<p>re: Lean/Axiom communication. These are "peer" systems so each needs/provides services. Axiom has 10k algorithms that need to be proven correct so it needs Lean (and an associated "computer algebra" mathlib-like library on the Lean side). Lean needs to be able to use heavy algorithms (like Groebner basis) with the associated proof so it can get "Oracle" answers. I am not at the stage of defining the communication link. </p>
<p>But (I think) Lean is the combination of a trusted core, and as of Lean 4, the rest of it will be Lean code. If that is the case it should be possible to re-implement the trusted core in Lisp and embed all of Lean inside Axiom. That way there is no "communication link" as each system has shared data representations.</p>

<p>As for the proving and running algorithms, will they be running in Axiom or Lean?  For example, the user wants a calculation of <code>gcd 6 9</code>.  Would that calculation be done in Axiom with an algorithm verified by Lean offline to be correct?  Would that calculation be done entirely in Lean?  Or would Axiom compute some sort of proof witness that would be checked in Lean?  (I'm not sure what that would be for gcd, but for an integral it could be a proof that the integrand is the derivative of the Axiom computed solution.)</p>

<p>One of the key problems with the idea of a peer-to-peer communication interface is context. Axiom allows full runtime, first class dependent type construction. So the types are "part of the session". Since dependent types are undecidable Axiom uses built-in heuristics to resolve types at runtime. That mean, of course, that if you try to communicate the expression "x^2-2*x+1", you also have to communicate the type of "x" and the type of the coefficient ring (is it modular?) as well as the type of the whole expression.</p>
<p>Merging Lean and Axiom in a common system means that the runtime dependent types are shared and Lean can know that this is a polynomial with coefficients mod p. Similarly, the question above about doing integration means that Lean has access to Axiom's implementation of the Risch algorithm.</p>

<p>As for the "I'm surprised that a Microsoft-related Lean program doesn't have this tooling." rant, I think you are confused by the relation between Microsoft whose business is to sell software to users and Microsoft Research where Leo is working on a research project that is not looking for users yet.</p>

<p>Most of it is implemented. The part of lean4's inductive that deal with nested inductive I haven't done yet since I wanted to get a C++ person's opinion on how <code>local_ctx</code> works, and the new declaration types exist but don't do anything because they're never called. w.r.t the mutual thing, from the kernel's perspective it's like a <code>Vec&lt;Definition&gt;</code> where <code>Definition</code> is the <code>def my_thing : A := ...</code> variety, and they're marked meta. The process for checking whether they're admissible is like iterating over them with the same procedure as for definitions.</p>

<p>Emacs runs fine. Apparently Docker has moved/merged with Kubernetes so I'm behind the curve on yet another technology. It takes forever to understand how to build one of these things so it might take a while. Kubernetes is more network capable . Axiom uses X11 for its graphics and browser front-ends and has used a remote X11 server successfully. I suspect there is a way to get vscode to "network" so I'm going to dig into that. I may be able to get lean --server to pipe to a network using ns. There are many "variables in play" here and I still have a lot to learn.<br>
There won't be much more to say until I get happy with the results. </p>
<p>That said, I think that a Docker/(Kubernetes?) solution provides a trivial-to-install, stable platform for releases that run everywhere. I think that a Kubernetes version of Lean "in the cloud" is also possible, perhaps connected to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="116034">@William Stein</span> 's Sage system or the Jupiter notebooks. </p>
<p>I think that a "point and click" version of Lean would be easier for mathematicians and students to use.</p>

<p>That's one thing I have wanted to look into, but never actually got to it: Since VScode runs on electron, it should be easy to run the editor front-end on a simple laptop, and run the back-end (including Lean) on some heavy-duty server.
