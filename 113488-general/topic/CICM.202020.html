<p>Mario, you were right to call me out for opposing "tactic proof" to "declarative proof" -- that's not what I meant. I really like Sébastien's proofs, and I count them as declarative.</p>
<p>But I think the point remains that there is a tension between writing short proofs and writing proofs that are easy for others to read. In Mathlib (as well as in the Mathematical Components library), the emphasis is mostly on being short and efficient, rather than on being verbose and explanatory. I am not complaining about that, only pointing out that there is a difference.</p>

<p>In the current state of technology, it doesn't seem realistic to me to have a single library which is good for large scale formalization and teaching. We can write readable proofs and use format_lean or something better in this spirit for teaching, but it won't be mathlib.</p>

<p>The fundamental ones are <code>from</code> and <code>using</code> IIRC (what even is the difference?

<p>A tactic in Isabelle (unlike in HOL4 etc.) produces a possibly infinite sequences of states. Normally users only see the first one. When you combine them, depending on which tactical (i.e., operator on tactics, such as <code>;</code>) you use, the sequences will be combined differently. Thus you can write simple tactics that, say, explore both the left and the right branch of a disjunction, and so on. In practice, this is very little used, though.</p>

<p>Oh, but <em>after</em> <code>m1</code> you can insert some more Isar steps, i.e. <code>have</code> etc. So it's "I prove this fact using this initial tactic (e.g. induction), then I do some other steps, then I solve the remainder using this final tactic (e.g. slaying boring induction cases with <code>auto</code>)".</p>

<p><code>proof m1 ... qed m2</code>. This is like <code>begin ... end</code> in Lean, but <code>m1</code> (a proof method) is applied before entering, as the first step. This makes it possible to do a bit of massaging using a proof method in an Isar proof. Similarly, the rarely used <code>m2</code> after <code>qed</code> can kill whatever cases are left.

<p>A tactic is an ML (metaprogramming) concept. A proof method is an "interactive" tactic in Lean lingo, one that is registered as available in Isar. Since there's always a tactic behind a proof method, the distinction is not so relevant to most users.</p>

<p><code>#lint-</code> is silent so you can write it at the bottom of your file and leave it there. It's loud when something goes wrong and makes no message when it succeeds.</p>

<p>The <code>OK</code> messages are there so you know it's working. If it's your first time using <code>#lint</code> and you happened to get everything right, you might wonder if something was broken when there was no output.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="239426">@Christian Szegedy</span>  presented a very hopeful message basically saying that modern AI is showing amazing results and and computation is growing quite fast, but he was fairly tight lipped about what he is working on with specifics (excepted for already published papers).  I think he said something non-specific about research level mathematics being formalized in the 10 years, but again I think this was more hopeful than a specific 10-year plan on his part.

<p>But I think the point remains that there is a tension between writing short proofs and writing proofs that are easy for others to read. In Mathlib (as well as in the Mathematical Components library), the emphasis is mostly on being short and efficient, rather than on being verbose and explanatory. I am not complaining about that, only pointing out that there is a difference.</p>

<p>I think this deserves attention. Also, maintainability could later depend on someone trying to understand the proof later. Here, a (more) declarative style might help.</p>

<p>In lean, we work from the presumption that the proof context at all intermediate points is available. This is in common with Coq, and a significant difference from Isabelle where the expectation is that the proof text should be readable on its own. So lean tooling goes into making sure that you can see the tactic state (even if you are on a browser or something), rather than redundantly (and insufficiently) copying bits of the tactic state into lots of <code>have</code> and <code>show</code> lines.</p>

<p>Kevin has said on many occasions (to the agreement of many here, I believe) that he finds tactic proofs more readable than "declarative" isar style term proofs because the tactic state provides a tremendous amount of context and clarity to the proof.

<p>You bring an interesting point. When I first learned Isabelle, I only knew the backwards approach.

<p>I am the worst person to talk to about these things because I can never remember what all these different kinds of proofs are. I am always surprised that there are people who see proofs in this way, asking how they fit together. Mathematicians sometimes argue forwards and sometimes backwards, and if it's in tactic mode with comments then you can normally find your way around it, whichever way it's going</p>

<p>One mental straightjacket that theorem provers impose is you have to prove theorems in the order that you state them. While within a tactic block you can work "forwards" and "backwards", on a bigger scale you're forced into working "forwards".</p>

<p>In a good maths paper, the author will tell me the big result they want me to care about, then tell me the "big ideas" of the proof (whether or not this is done inside a <code>\begin{proof} ... \end{proof}</code> LaTeX environment, and then spend the rest of the paper preparing promised ingredients, cleaning up loose ends, doing computations, etc. It's great to read papers like this, because you have the easy option of "Oh, Section 4 is going to prove Lemma B, and I can see how that would work, so I'm going to skip it."</p>

<p>Especially because long proofs tend to be slow to elaborate, in Lean, and I suspect all other theorem provers, we tend to take a much more pedagogical style of building everything up in little increments. Obviously there are some big advantages here --- no one like having to wonder if an argument has become circular, which is always a possibility once it's "non-linear". And if you're a student needing to learn all the detailed mechanics, it's no problem reading it from the beginning.</p>

<p>But eventually it's a bit of a hassle. :-). I can imagine a theorem prover with a new keyword <code>promise</code>, where you just get to state a lemma, without proving it. You then use it happily, but have to come back to it by some specified boundary. Some linearity could easily be enforced (when it's time to prove a promise, the environment is "rolled back" to the moment it was stated, perhaps).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a good maths paper, the author will tell me the big result they want me to care about, then tell me the "big ideas" of the proof (whether or not this is done inside a <code>\begin{proof} ... \end{proof}</code> LaTeX environment, and then spend the rest of the paper preparing promised ingredients, cleaning up loose ends, doing computations, etc. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also enjoy this style of writing, and it is another sample of the fact that processing formal languages does not come in our genes. But we do not need to stretch the “readable sources” up to this point. In fact, formalized mathematics could be regarded as the (long) labor done to establish a result, and the write up always happens afterwards (which I imagine obtained by post-processing the sources and could cross-reference them at appropriate places).</p>

<p>It's also posted on <a href="https://coq.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/237655-Miscellaneous/topic/Formalizing.20undergraduate.20mathematics/near/206341456">Coq's Zulip here</a> and Coq people are also wondering if the slides are available (It's available on the CICM 2020 Slack but I don't know if it's available as a public URL too).</p>

<p>There're also lots of interesting discussions that happened on the CICM 2020 Slack. Two questions that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> have spent quite some time to answer are (essentially) :</p>
<ul>
<li>Why should mathematicians care about (systematic) formalization?</li>
<li>Why Lean might be a better choice for mathematicians?</li>
</ul>
<p>The related answers are posted here as a gist  <a href="https://gist.github.com/utensil/b4616dd5452d665318780c8a8b193dcc">here</a> if anyone is interested.</p>

<p>I quickly read Mario and Kevin's stuff. I agree with a lot of what I see there, but I think the discussion about why Lean works better for mathematicians misses an important piece: the community help. I hope new users here stay around because they like the fact that many people spend a lot of time answering questions in the new members stream. We can spend ages describing everything that is nice in Lean, and compare it to what we think we know about the other proof assistants. But the actual reason why Kevin and I are here is that we came to Gitter (that we used to chat before Zulip) and Johannes Hölzl and especially Mario Carneiro spent <em>days</em> answering all our dumb questions until we started to understand something. We both tried Coq before, and it lacked a Mario.</p>

<p>Yeah, without the community (which at that time was much smaller but was somehow still sufficiently big) Patrick and I would never have got going. Mario, Simon, Johannes and Reid were key players here -- when I was getting bogged down with the basics Mario was essential, and when I was getting bogged down with technicalities of type theory when doing schemes, and the realisation that R[1/fg] was not equal to R[1/f][1/g], Reid was invaluable.</p>
