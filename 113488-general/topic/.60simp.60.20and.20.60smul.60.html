<p>Apparently some people like <code>smul_add</code> as a <code>simp</code> lemma but not <code>mul_smul</code>. I was trying to make some sense of this. We just have a set-up of a monoid acting on an add_comm_group. Is there some "general theory" which tells me how to set up a natural confluent rewrite system? A lot of the <code>simp</code> lemmas seem to be "pushing brackets outwards", an idea which depends on priorities. Also <code>neg</code> seems to be being pushed outwards. Is that clearly the way to send it? There must be a lot known about what's going on here. Why is <code>mul_smul</code> not a <code>simp</code> lemma?</p>

<p>I'm also pretty fuzzy on the boundary between simp and non-simp here. My understanding is that generally <code>distrib</code> type lemmas are not <code>simp</code>, and are instead are included by hand, or left to <code>abel</code> and <code>ring</code>.</p>

<p>I think a simp set containing all the <code>distrib</code> type lemmas would be good.</p>

<p>(Potentially even with a wrapper tactic, called either <code>distrib</code> or <code>expand</code>.)</p>

<p>I have no idea about which way one should push negations... :-) I guess we've mostly got the default the <code>simp</code> pull negations outwards, and we have <code>push_neg</code> when you want to do the opposite. I would also love to hear an account of why this is best.</p>

<p>(My experience setting up <code>simp</code> lemmas for category theory led me to believe <code>simp</code> is too blunt a tool. Consider things like <code>functor.map_comp : F.map (f ≫ g) = F.map f ≫ F.map g</code>. When you a primarily "reasoning about the functor", you want this to be a <code>simp</code> lemma, so that you can get to the point of seeing what <code>F</code> is doing on "atomic" things, where hopefully you can use the definitional lemmas associated to <code>F</code>. On the other hand, when you are primarily "reasoning about the morphisms", you want it the other way, because hopefully you have an equation for <code>f ≫ g</code>. This means you want it to be a <code>simp</code> lemma while setting up the basic theory of functors, but then it's less clear afterwards. Because APIs get written linearly, often this effect means we end up with <code>simp</code> attributes lasting too long.</p>
<p>One solution is lots of auxilliary tactics: <code>push_functor</code> and <code>pull_functor</code>, etc. I think these would be good additions in many domains across mathlib.</p>
<p>Another solution is to give <code>rewrite_search</code> some further love --- perhaps even hooking it up to <code>gptf</code>. This problem of <code>simp</code> rarely actually being confluent was what motivated me to start writing it.)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> Another option is to be more conservative with tagging things with <code>simp</code> and locally enabling simp sets (can we enable entire simp sets locally?)</p>

<p>So that when we set up the basics of functors, in that file <code>map_comp</code> is simp. But in other files the converse is marked with <code>simp</code>.</p>

<p>This would be a good feature, to be able to locally turn on a simp set (so for the rest of the file just <code>simp</code> will include those lemmas).</p>

<p>It would be cool if you could say "simp things to this order", ie <code>simp priority [(*), (+), ring_hom.coe_fn]</code> or something would try to pull <code>*</code> outside of <code>+</code>, and both <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> outside of ring_hom applications</p>

<p>Maybe a general mechanism for <code>push_X</code>, <code>pull_X</code> tactics could support something like this.</p>
