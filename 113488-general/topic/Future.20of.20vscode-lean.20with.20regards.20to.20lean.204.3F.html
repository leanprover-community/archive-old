<p>Does it make sense to contribute to the vscode-lean extension with lean 4 being on the horizon? I'm not sure I can significantly improve the infoview, but I'd love to give it a try (I dearly miss a click to insert <code>rw ${term at cursor}</code> feature that would allow to quickly unfold definitions). If the thing would be obsolete with lean 4, I'd wait until the release of lean 4 though.</p>

<p>it will not be obsolete. as it stands, the lean 4 lsp server has the basic architecture for making lsp work correctly, but we haven't yet invested time into the tactic side of the server. ideally, it should work so that all the neat widget stuff will still work similarly to before.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> Something to keep in mind is that the state of Lean 4 editor support is rudimentary -- we are largely working out foundational/architectural details as opposed to anything user-visible. There are no features like tactic state, goto-definition, type hovers, etc. In fact, there is not even a vscode-lean4, it's just that the new server is Language Server Protocol-based so it works with any editor supporting LSP out of the box, but Lean-specific things are still a ways away.</p>

<p>I didn't have a look yet, but I'm definitely going to. I want to make some more progress on my lean proof first though. How would I extend the widget view from Lean? I'm quite experienced with React/TypeScript and apparently the goal view in VS Code is a react web view. Also, I have some ideas of how the abbrevation mechanism could be improved (and aligned to the emacs experience).</p>

<p>It's a research project, not a product. Leo always said this. I don't know if he wants lean 4 to be a product, and I've met people who won't use lean 3 because they say it's too unstable, but I am really enjoying the way people are just experimenting with the entire system at all times. We seem to be learning a lot.</p>

<p>If Lean 4 exposes a fully features syntax tree, possibly with meta information, semantic highlighting + inline type information could be implemented for VS Code easily. It would look like this: <a href="/user_uploads/3121/LeJkgQcFbZMHzpWyOctv-qNN/Frame-1.png">Frame-1.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/3121/LeJkgQcFbZMHzpWyOctv-qNN/Frame-1.png" title="Frame-1.png"><img src="/user_uploads/3121/LeJkgQcFbZMHzpWyOctv-qNN/Frame-1.png"></a></div><p>Terms of type "Prop" could be highlighted to distinguish them from non-prop-terms. Also, if only a single hypothesis or goal is changed, that goal could be rendered inline.</p>
