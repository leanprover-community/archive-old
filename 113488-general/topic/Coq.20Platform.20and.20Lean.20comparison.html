<p>Enrico Tassi, Th√©o Zimmermann and I just published a preprint describing the <a href="https://github.com/coq/platform">Coq Platform</a>, the official distribution of Coq together with libraries, plugins, and tools: <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03592675/document">https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03592675/document</a></p>
<p>We focus in particular on applying the Coq Platform for reproducing research artifacts, such as formalizations of mathematics, and on preparing specialized distributions for teaching with Coq.</p>
<p>We are interested in any feedback on this from the Lean community, in particular on our comparison of the Platform to Lean/mathlib in <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03592675/document?page=9">section 7.4 on page 9</a>.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="198375">@Karl Palmskog</span> Thanks! I completely agree with what you say about backwards compatibility and upgrade paths concerning Lean and mathlib. However, in an orthogonal direction, mathlib makes a very strong effort for internal compatibility. So that the algebra hierarchy is compatible by design with the topological library, etc... I think this is one benefit of mathlibs approach that deserves to be mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span> we follow Coq's approximate cycle of 6-month turnaround for releases (Platform release comes about 1-2 months after a Coq release)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> thanks for the feedback, we will note this for any camera ready or resubmission (the current submission is to <a href="https://qcomp.org/rrrr/2022/">RRRR 20222</a>, but we hope it will be invited to a journal)</p>

<p>I would argue, though, that MathComp has a similar "internal compatibility" policy as Mathlib, and we do include MathComp itself and many MathComp standalone subprojects in the Platform</p>

<p>I suspect there may be a specific "MathComp Platform" for teaching at some point that's a strict subset of the general Platform</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="198375">@Karl Palmskog</span> Regarding the specific wording of "In contrast to Coq, which aims to provide up-<br>
grade paths between versions, Lean 3 and Lean 4 are largely incompatible", these two things are not in opposition. You can be incompatible and also aim to provide an upgrade path, and indeed if upgrading is a thing you need to do to the code then it sounds like it's already not backward compatible. For lean 3 -&gt; lean 4 we are in fact investing heavily in providing an upgrade path, this is the <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathport">mathport</a> tool.</p>

<p>the Coq compatibility policy means, with minor exceptions, that a project that is compatible with Coq version 8.X and has no deprecation warnings on 8.X will be compatible at the source level out-of-the-box with Coq version 8.(X+1) - but possibly with deprecation warnings on 8.(X+1). To me, even in the presence of tool to help with porting, this is a difference in <em>kind</em> and not in <em>degree</em> compared to the Lean approach.</p>

<p>but if the paper gets considered for a journal submission, we will be sure to add more specifics about compatibility management in our comparisons.</p>

<p>We incorporated feedback from the topic here into a new version of the paper (<a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03592675v2">https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03592675v2</a>). For example, we mention the mathport tool in our Lean comparison.</p>
<p>The new paper version will be the basis of a presentation in the <a href="https://qcomp.org/rrrr/2022/">RRRR</a> reproducibility workshop at ETAPS on April 2, 2022. Any feedback on the new paper version is also welcome, since we hope to do a journal version eventually.</p>
