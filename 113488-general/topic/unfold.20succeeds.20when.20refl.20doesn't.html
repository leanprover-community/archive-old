<p>Another question I had about recursive functions was under what conditions an expression is definitionally equal to what it expands into, including its recursive call.<br>
For example, given this function:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">myfun</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">ℕ</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">ℕ</span>

<span class="bp">|</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="bp">|</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="bp">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="k">have</span> <span class="n">h</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="bp">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="bp">/</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="bp">&lt;</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="bp">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="gr">sorry</span><span class="o">,</span>

<span class="kd">lemma</span> <span class="n">myfun_check</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">myfun</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="n">myfun</span> <span class="o">((</span><span class="mi">0</span> <span class="bp">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="bp">/</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="kd">by</span> <span class="n">refl</span> <span class="c1">-- fails</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>I cannot prove <code>myfun_check</code> using <code>refl</code>, despite the left side expanding into the right side through computation. However, unfolding seems to work for some reason. I didn't realize it was possible for <code>unfold</code> to close a goal when <code>refl </code>doesn't. Is there a reason why <code>refl</code> doesn't work? I tried giving <code>myfun</code> the <code>reducible</code> attribute, but it didn't change anything.</p>

<p>If you <code>#print myfun._main._pack</code> you'll see the equation compiler compiles this recursive definition using well-founded recursion, and for some reason the computation rule for well-founded recursion can't be made rfl. (Most recent discussion in <a href="#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/subject.20reduction/near/312227755">this thread</a>.)</p>

<p>I'm still having a bit of difficulty understanding that thread you linked, since I mostly treat the equation compiler as a sort of black box program that rewrites recursion in terms of induction, and have never actually thought about how it worked in practice. I can perhaps take a closer look at thread later, but I guess its understandable that <code>rfl</code> doesn't work for axiomatic reasons.<br>
I'm fine if this isn't a definitional equality, but is there a way to, for example, expand one level of a recursive function in general, without going into the details behind well-foundedness (which I know little about)? <code>unfold</code> seems to work in this case, but it can be a bit annoying to use, especially, when unfolding something like an operator that is actually a typeclass instance.</p>

<p>In general the answer is <code>unfold</code>. If there is a type class or something involved then it can also be a good idea to create your own "equational lemmas" phrased in a convenient way, and rewrite with them</p>

<p>I guess if <code>unfold</code> works best I'll use that. I guess I was originally confused because I had previously thought that <code>rfl</code> worked by computing both sides of the equation until they equaled the same thing but I guess it's more complicated than that.</p>

<p>"computing" is a complicated word</p>

<p>Yes, it is. My current understanding of computing, when it comes to Lean, is that lambda expressions are evaluated by replacing all instances of the bound variable with the argument, so that <code>(fun x, x + 2) 3</code> is definitionally equal to <code>3 + 2</code>. In addition, whenever Lean encounters a "recursor" it evaluates it according to special rules so that <code>(nat.cases_on 3 "hello" (λ n, "world") : string)</code> reduces to <code>"world"</code> despite the fact that <code>nat.cases_on</code> is not defined as a lambda expression.<br>
However, I could see how in really complicated expressions generated by the equation compiler, it could potentially get stuck on a recursor with some variable inside. I don't know if this is why <code>rfl</code> doesn't work on all well-founded recursive functions though.</p>

<p>If you do <code>#print prefix myfun</code> then you'll see the equation lemmas generated by the definition. Those are what <code>unfold</code> knows. In an ideal world they'd all be proved by <code>rfl</code> but for technical reasons this is not always the case.</p>
