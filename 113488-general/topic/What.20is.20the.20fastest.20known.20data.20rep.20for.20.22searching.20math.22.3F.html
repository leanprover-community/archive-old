<p>Regardless of what Lean4 uses, you probably have some idea about how you would code a data structure representing expressions in math faithfully and comprehensively, in such a way that say searching for applicable theorems to some givens has optimal runtime.  There are of course more things you'd also want to search about when doing math, so what I gave was just an example.  My idea is put everything into one large graph db (but one in memory and coded in C++ or D).  Some nodes may have arrows that point to child nodes in some expression while other arrows represent implications and so on...  Anyway, I don't think that would be very fast to search, because I made a <a href="http://q.uiver.app">q.uiver.app</a> CD diagram to Neo4j graph db saver /loader and it was slow as hell, with nearly nothing in the db.  So I am on a quest to know what the fastest searchable representation of math is.  That we are aware of.</p>

<p>In Lean 4 (I know you said regardless but still, its a general approach :P) we have discrimination trees to build maps from expr -&gt; whatever, to be precise <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Lean.Meta.DiscrTree#doc">docs4#Lean.Meta.DiscrTree</a>, which is at least quite good but i would assume not the best solution there is.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="395550">@Henrik Böving</span>   First off, there's not much info on google about discr trees.  Secondly, you didn't explain why it was a good design for Lean4.</p>

<p>If you want to talk about why the proof search is the way it is and so on Leo is the expert on that i only have very superficial knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="236489">@Daniel Donnelly</span> It all depends on what you are searching for.  If you are searching for an exact string match then use a hash table.  If you searching up to alpha equivalence, or are searching for expressions that unify with a query expression containing metavariables then I bet what Lean 4 does is really efficient.  If you want a more general type of equivalence used in the matching, like logical equivalence or some vague idea of similar formulas, then you are getting into active research areas probably.</p>

<p>If you want to know more about discrimination trees and similar term indexing data structures, have a look at Chapter 26 of the Handbook of Automated Reasoning (Vol. 2) "Term Indexing" by Sekar, Ramakrishnam, and Voronkov.</p>
