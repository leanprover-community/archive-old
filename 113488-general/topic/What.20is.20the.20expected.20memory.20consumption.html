<p>When I load <code>data.real.basic</code> I get already around 4GB of memory consumption. When I browse some files I get even more. I just tried to open the LTE (with no other projects open) and lean says excessive memory consumption when I open the <code>condensed/ab.lean file</code>. My system tells me that LEAN now uses over 20GB of RAM. Is the fix really to just increase the memory limit even further? Right now it is set to 16GB. This is in the VS-code extension with the setting <code>checking visible files</code>, and only <code>condensed/ab.lean</code> is visible (the only open file in fact).</p>

<p>Ok, actually it seems to only take long in one of the projects that I have. So somehow the oleans probably got messed up there, and I just need to just build them again. I assume that <code>lean --make src</code> would reuse already existing oleans from what you were saying.</p>

<p>It seems that the <code>.olean</code> files are put in the same directory as the source code. So I guess you could just try to find <code>.lean</code> files, that do not have a <code>.olean</code> file in their directory. Or can some <code>.olean</code> get into an invalid state, where they are there, but no longer used?</p>

<p>Yes, if you change a <code>.lean</code> file, the <code>.olean</code> file, and also the <code>.olean</code> file for all the files depending on the changed <code>.lean</code> file, is out of date and can't be used.</p>

<p>I guess that would be good. Although for me the issue was that I just did not know how the compiler handles things. Probably that was mentioned somewhere and I missed it. But if not maybe it makes sense to mention it more explicitly that changing anything in the <code>_target</code> folder is a bad idea, or at least that they should run <code>lean --make src</code> afterward. I know at least one other person who also very likely ran into this issue.</p>

<p>Ok, so I guess undo would work always, and trying to delete it would fail often when you make large changes because you would likely miss some whitespace. Good to know.</p>

<p>There is a discussion about this on zulip from a couple of weeks back, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> wanted to make target read only or at least add some warning to the extension when you edit (I can't find the link right now when I'm on mobile). I definitely think an alert message when you start editing target warning not to save any changes and to close the tab and restart lean when done #checking would help people avoid this</p>

<p>Of course this message should have a "never show again" checkbox so people who want to edit _target files don't get annoyed by it every time!</p>

<p>That seems like a very good idea.</p>

<p>At least for new people, it could save them some headaches.</p>

<p>The pernicious thing that happened to me actually seems especially bad. I actually thought that it was normal for <code>data.real.basic</code> to load so long, because although I invalidated some <code>.orlean</code> files related to it, it was still not so slow that it was obviously not intentional. (It took like 15s or so I think).</p>

<p>And only when I tried to open the LTE did I run against the wall of nonunderstanding hard enough to realize that it exists.</p>

<p>Is there a general troubleshooting page for questions like this? The main advice I’ve seen on the mathlib web pages is “ask on Zulip”.</p>
