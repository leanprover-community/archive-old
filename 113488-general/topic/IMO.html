<p>Not sure where to post this (PR reviews, mathlib maintainers, or IMO-grand-challenge), so it goes here.</p>
<p>I wrote a README.md to go in <code>/archive/imo/</code>, giving some advice (and opinions!) about the role of that folder in mathlib. See <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/8799">#8799</a>. Hopefully it is helpful to new contributors of IMO problems. If we merge something like it, I will linkify #imo to point at it.</p>
<p>Please feel free to suggest changes (or just make them directly).</p>

<p>If anyone thinks it is valuable (and/or wants to write it), it may also be useful to add a paragraph about the status and aspirations of the IMO grand challenge.</p>

<p>Possibly also useful would be for someone with more direct experience with the IMO than me to write a paragraph or two about prospects for including a more representative slice of IMO problems, and what remains to be done in mathlib before this is possible.</p>
