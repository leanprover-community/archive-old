<p>In the following code snippet, I add a declaration to the environment and then try to evaluate it. However, I get an error message stating that the declaration doesn't exist. Does <code>add_decl</code> create VM code for the added declaration?</p>

<p>I have rewritten my code to work around this. My command adds a declaration to the environment if it doesn't exist yet, and in either case, then I do something with its value.  I now rewrote the code so that I don't have to evaluate the newly added declaration. Evaluating a declaration added by a previous invocation of the command works fine.</p>

<p>If someone finds this stream by searching: beware that if you write a command that adds a declaration to the environment if it doesn't exist yet (and then do something else), you will probably run into problems:</p>
<p>If file A and file B both add the same declaration to the environment, then file C which imports both of these files will raise the error that some declaration has been defined twice.</p>
