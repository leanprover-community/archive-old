<p>Since this came up in a PR recently, it seems time to clarify the guidelines for the "Author" attribution on mathlib files. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="123965">@Bryan Gin-ge Chen</span> proposed a change at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/leanprover-community.github.io/pull/58">https://github.com/leanprover-community/leanprover-community.github.io/pull/58</a> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regarding the list of authors: we don't have strict rules on what<br>
contributions qualify for inclusion there. The general idea is that<br>
the people listed there should be the ones we would reach out to if we had<br>
questions about the design or development of the Lean code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this captures the intent of the author list. In practice, it's very much not a list of everyone who has contributed to the file; this is typically tracked by the git history. Refactorings and file renamings can occasionally make the history hard to trace, but refactorings are also a problem for lists of contributors.</p>
<p>Just wanted to highlight the change in case anyone has thoughts/comments, since it's a community policy thing!</p>

<p>This would be policy going forward, btw, I certainly don't plan to remove any author attributions myself and I doubt anyone else does.</p>
