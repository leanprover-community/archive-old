<p>I've been suffering in silence with this issue for a while, so I thought I should report it in case others are too, and to ask for help.</p>
<p>VSCode regularly (i.e. every session) reaches a state as illustrated in the attached video. Every key stroke causes a recompilation, and the interface lags out many many seconds behind my typing. I can recover by restarting the server or restarting VSCode, but usually within at most a few minutes (and often instantly) I am back in the same state.</p>

<p>I've certainly experienced this, but much more rarely, and if I fix it by restarting VS Code then the problem goes away and doesn't come back. However nowadays I am typically working with very short and simple files in a repo which depends on a fully compiled mathlib which I never mess with.</p>

<p>Yeah. Today I have been working deep at the bottom of the mathlib hierarchy, so I suspect this behaviour is correlated with that.</p>

<p>Oh. I did just realise I have the Lean extension set to the default limit of 4gb RAM. I'll change that to 40gb and see if things get better. :-)</p>

<p>The other thing one can try is closing all files other than the one you're working on. But I guess it would be good if you could reliably get this to happen (I never could)</p>

<p>Ah, I'd forgotten that was an extension --- it is the "Error Lens" extension, which is very nice, putting messages inline in the editor! It often means for simple stuff you can avoid needing the infoview.</p>

<p>If you can get Lean in this state, it might be interesting to see if the server is doing something crazy. If you open the control palette (ctrl+shift+P / cmd+shift+P) and search for "Developer: Open Webview Developer Tools", VS Code should pop up a browser debug window with a console at the bottom, and vscode-lean should be dumping all the messages from the server there.</p>

<p>The usual tricks I use if I end up in this state are to restart lean, close other files (especially ones that depend on the file I'm working on if it's deep in the dependency tree), and put <code>#exit</code> right after the command I'm working on so that elaborating the rest of the file is quick (which speeds up that character-to-character loop in the video)</p>

<p>I sometime copy the file content to a different gitgnored file and edit that one, to avoid dependencies.</p>

<p>I also get this really often (in Lean 4) and use the <code>#exit</code> trick for basically every single edit. I don't know if this was recently added as a feature, but increasing the compilation delay in the vscode extension settings helps a lot.</p>

<p>I don't get any messages there. But regarding "something crazy", I can indeed reproduce the problem in seconds by making an edit that breaks the entire (large) file, e.g. commenting out a <code>universe</code> declaration at the top.</p>

<p>However, that is actually not the main reason I often run into this, I think. At least in Lean 4, it seems that when Lean is checking a complicated <code>def</code>, it can't be interrupted, but the extension will happily launch more checks in parallel after typing more characters. This may be somewhat specific to my code, though.</p>

<p>Yes, this is a current limitation in the Lean 4 elaborator/server interaction. It will never spawn more tasks than your CPU has cores though.</p>

<p>Interestingly, my machine is not very powerful, and while I have had this problem from time to time, it's pretty infrequent for me, even when editing low-level files.</p>

<p>I think the cause of this is that Lean wants to greedily check far, far foward. In a large file, even checking to the bottom triggers this, but I find that the best way to reproduce this is to open a leaf file and then edit a file far higher up in the hierarchy that it depends on</p>

<p>I tend to try to put <code>#exit</code> after any code that I'm editing now for this reason (and <code>.</code> before if Lean is really acting up), and unless I'm actively working on two files at the same time (which I dislike doing in general) to close a file and THEN restart Lean before starting to work on another file that's on the same chain</p>

<p>It's been a long time since I've looked at the code for the extension, but if I remember correctly it shouldn't be sending changes to the server after every single keystroke; I thought there was a buffer of 100 ms or so...</p>

<p>From a quick glance, it looks like the extension uses that <code>LowPassFilter</code> for a few different status requests to the server, but there doesn't look like there's any filtering / batching for server requests when typing (handled, as far as I can tell, <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/blob/32cdc3fabbeb76b5f395f019f9bb6c3ee806dd85/src/sync.ts#L11">in <code>sync.ts</code></a>).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> This is a performance issue in the Lean 3 server.  It happens when you open two files, one at the beginning of the hierarchy, and one at the end of the hierarchy.  Editing the file at the beginning will be extremely laggy.  The workaround is to close the other files, and restart the Lean server (with the vscode command).</p>

<p>(Technical explanation: what happens is that on every file update the server receives, all reverse dependencies of the file are visited to recompile them.  The recompilation happens asynchronously of course, but dependency resolution etc. all happens during the original file sync request.  Thus: many reverse dependencies = laggy typing.  We could try to handle the invalidation part of the file sync request asynchronously, this wouldn't fix everything but at least diagnostics etc. would still be responsive.)</p>
