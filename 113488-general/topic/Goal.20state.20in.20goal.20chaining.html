<p>I suspect one of the reasons people use <code>;</code> so little is that you basically go blind with respect to the goals. Would it be possible to show all focused goals with their respective states simultaneously?</p>

<p>But why is it obfuscating? I claim this is precisely because you can hardly inspect the goal. If you have <code>split, { tac1, tac2, tac3 }, { tac1, tac2, tac3 }</code>, then replacing it with <code>split; { tac1, tac2, tac3 }</code> doesn't obfuscate anything. I would even claim it makes the proof more readable.</p>

<p>Of course, a side effect would be that people will start trying to parallel-golf, which indeed could obfuscate stuff. But that's a question of what people will do with the tools we hand them, rather than the tools themselves.</p>

<p>I almost always avoid the semicolon when teaching in Lean 3 for the sole reason that I think the students will find it confusing. The only times I've used it in my class so far are <code>split; assumption</code> and <code>split;linarith</code>, i.e. <code>split; close both goals</code>; for such arguments you don't need to see the tactic state.</p>

<p>It's made a little more explicit that its different from <code>,</code> in Lean 4 by both not having a comma and having <code>&lt;;&gt;</code> instead of just the regular <code>;</code> so maybe that helps?</p>

<p>I've sometimes seen proofs like <code>split; simp; nonsense</code> and lean happily ignores the <code>nonsense</code> - which is another mark against using <code>;</code></p>

<p>I'm a bit late to the conversation, but <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/pull/201">lean#201</a> tracks this in (community) Lean 3. (As Yaël said, this is probably moot as we'll probably move to Lean 4 before this issue is tackled).</p>
