<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110043">@Gabriel Ebner</span>  I saw your hammer talk (remotely unfortuately) and it was so cool I wanted to try it for myself! I appreciate its not a finished product so feel free to ignore me but I had two problems getting it to work on my machine: </p>
<p>I'm on OSX and the built in <code>grep</code> does not support <code>-oP</code> instead I had to replace it with a perl one-liner <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/16658690/2105639" target="_blank" title="https://stackoverflow.com/a/16658690/2105639">https://stackoverflow.com/a/16658690/2105639</a> it would be nice if this was built in (either perl everywhere? or some case switching depending on the OS) (I can try and send you a patch if you like).</p>
<p>The second is that commit <a href="https://github.com/gebner/mathlib/commit/f073946e12676ae0dd0ae87ac4d2a300fd4c082b" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/gebner/mathlib/commit/f073946e12676ae0dd0ae87ac4d2a300fd4c082b">https://github.com/gebner/mathlib/commit/f073946e12676ae0dd0ae87ac4d2a300fd4c082b</a> breaks everything for me, is my version of lean-community/lean:3.5.0 missing something that yours has?</p>
<p>With these two caveats I got it to run both with vampire and eprover-ho in the end, its very cool (and surprisingly the generated proofs are almost readable), thanks for your great work I can't wait till its done!</p>

<p>Thanks for the encouraging words, Alex!  If you send me the patch to switch to perl, I'll apply it.</p>

<p>The current version requires you to build lean from this branch here: <a href="https://github.com/gebner/lean/tree/feature_search" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/gebner/lean/tree/feature_search">https://github.com/gebner/lean/tree/feature_search</a> You can use <code>elan toolchain link</code> to register your locally built version of lean with elan and then it should just work.</p>

<p>Ah cool thanks! I looked but somehow didn't find that branch oops.</p>

<p><a href="/user_uploads/3121/QZ0fhZdsmb3gXRZIxtXNq-VU/perlpatch.diff" target="_blank" title="perlpatch.diff">perlpatch.diff</a> should do the trick I think. I'll test it once I have <code>feature_search</code>loaded</p>
