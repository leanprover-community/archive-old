<p>Lean seems to be very slow at elaborating calls to <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/finset.affine_combination">docs#finset.affine_combination</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/17912">#17912</a> I have a lemma whose statement involves six calls to <code>affine_combination</code>, where it's necessary to express three of them in the form <code>@finset.affine_combination R V _ _ _ _ _ _ s p w</code> instead of the desired <code>s.affine_combination p w</code> to avoid elaboration of the lemma statement timing out (this is about the statement, not the proof, and the slowness applies even if the proof is <code>sorry</code>) - I don't think it matters which three are expressed in that form, though I didn't try lots of variants. The issue isn't at all specific to that PR, however - the slowness can be seem for lots of lemma statements in <code>linear_algebra.affine_space.combination</code>, it's just that six uses of <code>affine_combination</code> in the same lemma statement is enough for the slowness to result in a timeout.</p>
<p>Can someone figure out why Lean is so slow working with <code>affine_combination</code> and how to fix that slowness?</p>
