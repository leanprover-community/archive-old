<p>I created an adapted version of the <code>continuity</code> tactic for <code>differentiable_at</code> type goals, which is here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/jamesa9283/400a021c9fc6d3c862914ca7c1d0dace">https://gist.github.com/jamesa9283/400a021c9fc6d3c862914ca7c1d0dace</a><br>
and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="266440">@Shing Tak Lam</span> and I were talking about implementing similar things for measurability and integrability and talk of a more general <code>analysis</code> tactic to do all of these arose, is this a good idea? I feel it would be useful as I find the <code>differentiability</code> and <code>continuity</code> useful on their own so one that does all would be amazing in my opinion and I don't want to create three copies of basically the same thing.</p>
<p><code>simp {discharger := differentiability}</code> also solves <code>deriv</code> goals, as probably expected.</p>

<p>I think this is a good idea. In fact I wanted to do it but got scared at the prospect of writing tactics. <span aria-label="upside down" class="emoji emoji-1f643" role="img" title="upside down">:upside_down:</span> I've run into places where I want to prove something is integrable and end up writing <code>apply continuous.integrable, continuity</code> or <code>apply integrable.integrable_on, apply continuous.integrable, continuity</code>, etc, a bunch of times.</p>

<p>I was thinking about this the other day. I don't know anything about tactics other than how to use them but I think some sort of integrability tactic would be great!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="304228">@James Arthur</span> If you find the tactic useful, go ahead and make a PR! (You should add some tests in your PR as well, cf. <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/test/continuity.lean">the <code>continuity</code> tests</a>.)</p>

<p>So I should PR differentiability on its own? Or develop a more general <code>analysis</code> tactic and then PR?</p>

<p>The tactic itself doesn't seem to have anything to do with analysis!</p>

<p>It would definitely be good to have a generalization.</p>
