<p>Hi. I'm not sure if or when, but I was wondering what graduate programs are out there. I have found some, but probably not all, and it would be great to hear from people who might have first hand experience. Thank you.</p>

<p>Graduate programs for what? Specifically for formalized math? I don't think those exist yet. Probably the best bet is applying to computer science departments that have faculty in this area.</p>

<p>I have a student Ashvni Narayanan working in formalised maths (Iwasawa theory) and this week I heard that Jujian Zhang, a former MSc student of mine who formalised transcendence of e in Lean, has been awarded funding by Imperial to do a PhD with me on elliptic curves and modular forms starting in October.</p>

<p>If you've "found some", then you probably have already made a note of CMU, but there are a <em>lot</em> of <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110865">@Jeremy Avigad</span> 's students on this Zulip.</p>

<p>NB my home department is the (unusually mathematical) philosophy department at Carnegie Mellon. It's a really interesting department that opens up all kinds of interesting possibilities for cross-disciplinary collaboration, and I have been blessed with a number of amazing students and postdocs over the years. It's a small PhD program and subject to the usual vicissitudes of funding, but we're always looking for good students.</p>
