<p>Hmm, quite annoying when I think my PR is ready for review, and I have labeled at that, and I’m patiently waiting for a review only to notice a few days later that CI wasn’t actually happy, and nobody is likely to look at it, and I only notice if I happen to check my open PRs. I wonder how best to avoid that? Maybe a bot that looks at PRs that are labeled <code>awaiting-review</code>, but CI is red, and that comment &amp; relabel the PR? Or maybe do that if nothing else is happening for a few days (no need to have bots annoy us when there is activity)?</p>

<p>You can look at either of <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/branches/yours">your Github branches</a> and of <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pulls/nomeata">your open PRs</a>.</p>

<p>You can setup github to send you emails when CI fails; I think this might even be the default</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="470149">@Joachim Breitner</span> I'm sorry to hear that. I agree this can be annoying, because it's sometimes not clear where the responsibility for a PR lies, and so they can fall through the cracks.<br>
I like your idea of a bot that draws some attention to such PRs.</p>

<p>(oh, and I hope it’s not negative to call this “rant”, I’m not blaming anyone or such. It’s just nice to speakout what is bothering a bit.)<br>
I think I might even get these emails, but they are also sent for PRs that I haven’t submitted for review, or for cancelled builds, so most of them are noise and that’s why I probably miss the relevant one.</p>

<p>Indeed, clear responsibilities are probably a good idea. Assuming we only expect reviews on CI-green PRs by default (maybe there is a separate way to indicate “this doesn’t pass yet, and I know, but I still would like a review”), then that label plus a red CI is an invalid state that could be reconciled by a bot, by assigning to the user? But I’m worried it might cause too much noise…</p>

<p>There is also a slight difference between "red because mathlib did not build correctly" and "red but the olean's are available".  I would say that flagging the first one is more important than the second one.</p>

<p>If you look at <a href="https://bit.ly/3zVLgqR">#queue</a>, it's just a fixed URL with some filtering parameters. I see two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a #broken_queue (or something along those lines) which points to such PRs</li>
<li>You can create a URL of your own with red PRs labeled as <code>awating_review</code> and include <code>author:joachim</code> as a parameter so you can see your broken PRs from time to time</li>
</ul>

<p>I do look at my PRs from time to time, that’s how I find these stuck PRs right now. But I’m spoiled and lazy, and would like someone (better something) alert me when I made a mistake  :-)</p>
