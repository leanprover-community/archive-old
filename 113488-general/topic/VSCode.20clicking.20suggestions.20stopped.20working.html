<p>I don't think I have (voluntarily) changed any setting, but clicking on suggestions in my VSCode does not  work any more. By "suggestion" I mean here the clickable "link" that appears in the Infoview when doing something like <code>library_search</code> or <code>squeeze_simp</code>. Am I alone?</p>
