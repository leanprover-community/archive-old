<p>I created a stream called "Is there code for X?". Can other people see it? Is it a good idea? I was thinking it could serve as a kind of a log of what people are searching for and help in creating keyword searchable documentation. Whenever you search for something and don't immediately find it, just create a topic in the stream.</p>

<p>And of course when you do find it, write down where you found it in the topic.</p>
