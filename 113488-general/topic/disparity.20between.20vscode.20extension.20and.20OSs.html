<p>I've noticed a couple of minor disparities between the vscode extensions for osx and windows; I assume the linux ones will be similar.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On OSX, if you press control and hover over an identifier, if you can go-to-def it will underline the name. This is nice for a) discovering the feature (I always used f12!), b) knowing what things go-to-definition will work on and won't.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Windows, <code>{!!}</code> â†’ <code>ctrl</code> + <code>.</code>'s menu has wrap-around scrolling, which is very nice as some of the most-used options are at the bottom (structure creation and such like); meanwhile, in OSX, it refuses to wrap-around at the top.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I wonder which of these are intentional, so that I could either report them to the right places (I assume VSCode) / fixed in the extension itself (I'm happy to help out with this)</p>
