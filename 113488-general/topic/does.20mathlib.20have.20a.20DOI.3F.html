<p>I'm doing some administrative task on Maria's grant, and I'm being asked whether there have been any contributions to research datasets. I cautiously hit "yes" and I was asked for the DOI, the title, and the year the dataset was published. Is mathlib a dataset? If so, does it have a DOI?</p>

<p>We could add mathlib to Zenodo (<a href="https://zenodo.org/">https://zenodo.org/</a>) a repository for research data and software that issues DOI's (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/alexjbest/cluster-pictures/#cluster-pictures">https://github.com/alexjbest/cluster-pictures/#cluster-pictures</a>)</p>

<p>It would certainly be nice to be able to link to something which shows up-to-date stats on mathlib, so that when whoever is intended to look into these things looks into them, they can be impressed.</p>

<p>I don't know. I never clicked this box before because none of my government-funded research ever had anything to do with databases. Oh -- I see that the results of my search explicitly list  Zenodo as "publisher" of much of the information.</p>

<p>Right -- my original question was exactly "although we have solved the problem of citing the library in papers, how do I report to the UK government that money spent by them (on Maria) has resulted in an enhancement of a database, when the web page is clearly expecting that database to be listed in Zenodo". Of course my current solution is "just don't bother reporting it this year", but this time next year when I'm asked again she might well have contributed several thousand lines of code.</p>

<p>We can alternatively make a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files">CITATION.cff</a> file, which github will parse to provide citations in APA and BibTeX formats.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found this to be quite limiting, and it's easier just to link to a markdown file where you can write whatever you like. My guess is that everyone who cares about formalizing mathematics is probably not planning to use APA, so a BibTeX snippet would suffice.</p>

<p>As a grad student, I have some questions for the professors in the room.<br>
Is it really worth going through the overhead of making a zenodo listing and versioning the repo to make a DOI when we could just use the DOI of the mathlib paper instead? <br>
Do the funding agencies really care about the distinction between the repository and the paper (which you might say acts as a kind of landing page for the repository)? <br>
Will a funding agency just look at the number of LOC in the repo and say "looks pretty good", or do they want us to say how much we personally contribute so they know specifically what they're paying for? <br>
As I write up my paper that uses mathlib to verify cryptography, should I cite the mathlib paper? The repository as a URL? Both? </p>
<p>It seems to me like it's often better to cite the paper, since in terms of someone reading <em>my</em> paper who wants to know what mathlib is, the mathlib paper is more descriptive than a link to the repo. If it's an issue of credit, the paper describes its author as "The mathlib Community", which I guess is accurate enough (although you see the maintainers when you visit the main page of the repo, and I think it's good that they can have some extra visibility for all the work they do).</p>

<p>Indeed my suggestion of adding a Zenodo entry was specifically in response to Kevin's original question of how to cite mathlib as a dataset. Versioning number decision aside there is very little overhead in adding something to Zenodo in my experience.<br>
As you say if you want to cite mathlib in a paper using the published description of the project seems way more useful.</p>

<p>And indeed the govt website I was using was specifically searching Zenodo when it was asking me for the names of the databases which their money had gone into expanding</p>
