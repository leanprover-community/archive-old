<p>Hi! I hope it's OK for me to post this here. I'm building a web-based interactive theorem prover at <a href="https://sreichelt.github.io/slate" target="_blank" title="https://sreichelt.github.io/slate">https://sreichelt.github.io/slate</a>, with a rendering infrastructure to improve readability. The basic idea is that every definition in the library also includes a specification that describes how to render it. Seeing the Lean+LaTeX discussion above, I wonder if someone would be interested in combining this with Lean.</p>
<p>Eventually, the goal is that users can directly edit the rendered content online without having to look at the source code at all, but the web-based version only includes a minimal proof of concept at the moment. (It works in a desktop-based predecessor, but I never managed to finish it.) But for a start, read-only rendering of Lean source code already seems useful.</p>
