<p>Given a Lean data structure, is there a way to count the size of the value, taken reference sharing into account?</p>
<p>As a concrete example, consider:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">inductive</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span>

<span class="bp">|</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">A</span>

<span class="kn">open</span> <span class="n">A</span>

<span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="c1">-- 3 / 2</span>
<span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">d</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="c1">-- 7 / 3</span>
<span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">e</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="n">d</span> <span class="n">d</span> <span class="c1">-- 15 / 4</span>
<span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="n">e</span> <span class="n">e</span>  <span class="c1">-- 31 / 5</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>If I walk over the tree and count every node one, I will get that <code>f</code> has size 31. However, in most functional languages, references can be shared, so a more accurate size would be 5.</p>
<p>Does Lean share references? And if so, is it possible to compute the size somehow?</p>

<p>You'll have to define to define what you mean by size anyway. If you really mean reference and not equality, then no that's impossible. If <code>c = d = b a a</code>, then you can't expect <code>size (b c c) = 3</code> and <code>size (b c d) = 4</code>, because then substituting <code>c = d</code> would give <code>3 = 4</code>.</p>

<p>I really do mean reference, unfortunately. </p>
<p>Can you confirm though that Lean does share reference internally? Intuitively it should be, since _not_ sharing seems harder to implement, but I want to be sure.</p>

<p>There's <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/sizeof">docs#sizeof</a> that is used, inter alia, by the equation compiler to infer that terms aren't growing without bound in recursive definitions. Perhaps it is related to what you need.</p>

<p>I think it might help for you to give some discussion about what you are looking to do with this information.  Also there are different levels here.  </p>
<p>There is the pure mathematical level.  In that case, as Yael pointed out, since Lean as a math language, can’t behave differently on equal objects, there is no way to have a math function which takes a value as input and can say anything about its implementation.  (This goes as well for <code>sizeof</code> mentioned above.)</p>
<p>Then there is the expression level.  Your <code>f</code> definition is stored in the environment, and using <code>meta</code> code, you can examine its expression, recursing over the tree.  In that case, I know references are shared since <code>e</code> in the expression for <code>f</code> is just basically a reference to the previous <code>e</code> declaration. You would have to do it as something like <code>refsizeof “e”</code> where <code>refsizeof</code> is a meta function which looks up a name from the environment, gets its expression, and traverses the tree.  (Edit: the <code>refsizeof</code> doesn’t exist.  You would have to write it.)</p>
<p>Finally, there is the execution level, where this datastructure is turned into computer code and uses pointers to other data structures.  It would be silly not to share references, but I don’t know how the VM works exactly and if there is any way to probe it.  Also, for Lean 4 (every thing I’ve said so far is for Lean 3) you might find this paper interesting where they show optimizations to recursive computations exploiting shared references: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3408997">https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3408997</a></p>

<p>Can I ask the dumb question - why do you want/care about this? What is it you are ultimately trying to achieve?</p>
<p>If what you want is not possible, it's possible there's another way to achieve what you actually want without having to resolve this particular issue.</p>

<p>I can't seem to find any meta function in Lean 3 that gives access to the pointer address of an object (this is what makes that Lean 4 code work as well as the optimizations in the paper). However, if you really want to be certain that Lean 3 shares references (in the VM), here is a simple proof by example:</p>

<p>As others have already surmised, this information is not exposed to lean code, although the VM is keeping track of it. It would not be hard to expose though, with a signature like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">meta</span> <span class="kd">constant</span> <span class="n">reference_count</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">A</span> <span class="n">B</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">A</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="bp">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">nat</span> <span class="bp">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">B</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">B</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is used by lean to make some behavioral changes for unshared arrays, for example. But knowing that something has 6 references or 5 is not necessarily so useful, and also you will have to be careful about off by one errors because the <code>reference_count</code> function itself will count as an extra reference (that's why it is being passed through the function in this example instead of just consumed)</p>

<p><code>expr.replace</code> is an example of a function that exploits dag sharing in order to efficiently traverse a highly shared expr data structure. Unfortunately I don't know a way to do the same thing for user types, so for example with the <code>binary_tree</code> type in Jason's example I don't know how you could write a <code>size</code> function that doesn't take exponential time in the highly shared case</p>

<p>we could just do something similar to lean 4 and expose pointer positions so that you can stick them in a hash table. Of course you will lose any ability to prove the correctness of such a function, and there is no way to avoid the unsafety of these accessors because they don't respect equality</p>

<p>Oh, I didn't necessarily want a function like <code>reference_count</code> that "just works" (although it would be cool to have one nonetheless). Having a function that takes a value and return an address (perhaps virtual one) would suffice for me. I can walk the structure and do the counting myself.</p>

<p>But as Jason said, this doesn't seem to be possible to Lean 3. But it is possible in Lean 4, as Kyle's link shows.</p>

<p>As Mario said it would be possible to add access to the pointer as a meta function, but it would require modifying Lean 3 to expose it.  (It would have to be <code>meta</code> since it doesn’t respect equality.  Similarly the Lean 4 version is <code>unsafe</code>.)</p>
