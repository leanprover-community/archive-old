<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110111">@Keeley Hoek</span> could you tell us a bit about <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/837" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/837">#837</a>? Is it something end users should know about? Do we need to do anything?</p>

<p>It's a utility function for tactic-writers mainly, which lets you compute something once in a tactic block or per definition (the idea that I should have different scopes was Simon's). It doesn't save-restore computed proofs like the other code I was spruiking a while ago unfortunately, which doesn't work via this method. Saving and loading expressions is so slow from within lean that barring a small modification to lean which adds io functions which do that for you from C++, I don't think it could be possible in vanilla.</p>
