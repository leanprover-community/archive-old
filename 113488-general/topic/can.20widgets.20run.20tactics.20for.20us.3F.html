<p>I've always been curious what it would be like have <code>library_search</code> run constantly --- I guess anytime that the cursor is at the end of begin end block, I'd like to spin up a <code>library_search</code>, and insert a light bulb if it succeeds and do nothing otherwise.</p>
<p>Is this at all achievable with our current UI? Can I add a widget that calls back to the server to run <code>library_search</code>, and then changes its html appearance if it gets a good result?</p>

<p>It might be possible but it'd be a bit of a disgusting hack. The only ways I know to get the Lean 3 server to run code involve inserting code into the file it has loaded and then filtering the messages for output. So you could insert a <code>by library_search</code> at the beginning / end of the line that the cursor is on and then remove it after Lean returned the result. (There are hole-commands, too, but you have to have <code>{! !}</code> or <code>_</code> in the Lean code to be able to trigger those.) </p>
<p>It'd be much nicer if we had a Lean server command for <code>#eval</code>ing or <code>run_cmd</code>ing at a certain point in a file...</p>
