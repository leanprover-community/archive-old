<p>So <code>discrete_field</code> used to imply <code>decidable_eq</code>.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110044">@Chris Hughes</span>' PR changed that.  Was that intentional?  I'm currently just adding <code>decidable_eq</code> assumptions everywhere.</p>

<p>This was intentional. It's consistent with the rest of the classes, we don't have decidable rings or anything. The convention is that we don't have <code>decidable_eq</code> assumptions for theorems that require it for the proof but not the statement, we just go classical, so I think most of the theorems should be classically provable still and don't require the assumption.</p>

<p>Since a total division function gives decidable equality at least in the propositional sense, there isn't much loss in having <code>decidable_eq</code> as part of <code>field</code>. It might not be possible to prove <code>decidable_eq</code> from the totality of division, but the only obstacle is predicativity. </p>
<p>See, for example, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04126.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04126.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04126.pdf</a> where Kihara and Pauly give a computable reduction of "robust division" for reals to LPO.</p>
