<p>If I have a goal like <code>a + b = a</code> and I have <code>add_zero (a : \N) :
  a + 0 = a</code>. Is it possible to rewrite this to say <code>a + b = a + 0</code> instead of <code>a + 0 + b = a + 0</code> (e.g. from <code>rw \l add_zero a</code>). I have not figured out how to specify this.</p>

<p>Conv mode can do this. You can specify where exactly to rewrite.</p>

<p>Also what are you trying to prove here? If it is that <code>b = 0</code> then there is an existing lemma called <code>add_right_eq_self</code>.</p>

<p>Thank you for your kind and quick answer, this is what I was looking for. I'm trying to prove existing theorems, yes. As you can see, I am quite new to this tool. Thanks again.</p>

<p>No problem. I'm quite new to this as well, I only really got started a week or two ago. Have you seen the Natural Numbers Game yet? This is one of the levels there.</p>

<p>Yes, I saw this yesterday :) Although, trying to hide n00bness with s/mynat/\N/ when posting here.</p>
