<p>Yes, I agree that it is desirable to have a small kernel.<br>
After exploring some approaches, my preliminary conclusion is that as far as I can tell, it is currently impossible to construct an efficient coinductive datatype (Edit: <em>without <code>unsafe</code></em>) even if it is done by hand without developing a general interface for coinductive type definition, at least if we allow arbitrary universe levels for <code>σ</code> in <code>corec</code> above (which I believe is possible if we don't care about efficiency).</p>
<p>So I agree that one probably needs <code>unsafe</code> to realize this, except if somebody has a great idea how we can efficiently transform an instance of <code>SF'</code> with high-universe <code>σ</code> into an efficient instance with low-universe <code>σ</code> (which is possible if we don't require efficiency!).</p>
