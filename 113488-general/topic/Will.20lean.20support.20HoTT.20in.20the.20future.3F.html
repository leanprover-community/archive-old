<p>I find HoTT or CuTT would be more convenient to the mathematicians, would Lean support this in the future?<br>
And I heard of another new language Arend that supports CuTT, would this be a potential proof assistant?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lean 2 supported HoTT</li>
<li>Lean 3 has a HoTT mode</li>
<li>Several mathematicians on this chat are completely unconvinced that HoTT brings useful features</li>
<li>Several other mathematicians have played a bit with HoTT and think it looks very cool and has a lot of promise, but in practice it <em>currently, right now</em> doesn't seem to help with <em>actual</em> formalisation of mathematics. This could change in the future, but it requires fundamental improvements of the proof assistents.</li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, yes, Arend looks cool.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> How do you activate the HoTT mode in Lean 3?</p>

<p>Lean 3 doesn't have a HoTT mode built in. The <a href="https://github.com/gebner/hott3">Lean 3 HoTT repository</a> uses some tricks to "disable" singleton elimination which is inconsistent with HoTT.</p>
