<p>Why does mathlib use typeclasses everywhere? <br>
I'm looking at mathlib seriously for the first time and have odd feelings about the design. There's probably a whole history behind it that I can't really figure out..<br>
If I had to do design a math library myself, I would probably start by not using typeclasses at all. I would use only structures and functions because its so easy to think with just them.<br>
I think typeclasses make sense in software programming contexts, where you start by modeling requirements at high level using abstract types, and you can decide later what implementation you want to plug in or out. Now it's not obvious to me why they are so useful in a proof library. I think you'd want to have a unique canonical representation for a given math concept, and some functions/theorems directly defined on it. I'm not sure why you want to abstract behavior so much.<br>
I have the impression that the main point of typeclasses in mathlib is to make some parameters and conversions implicit in order to make the code shorter. Mathlib design seems to assume that if it's shorter to write, it must be more simple. But is it really simpler to make information implicit if it becomes a hard problem to reconstruct it?<br>
I feel like there is too much effort in making things look extremely short often to the detriment of readability. On the one hand, tactics are really great because they automate work that's hard to do by hand, and it's usually clear what they do. On the other hand, typeclasses remove some boilerplate that would be easy to write by hand, but now it's hard to understand what instance is used where.<br>
I might sound crazy but I think I'd prefer converting inputs and passing instances explicitly every time i call a lemma in a proof. It's really a one time job, unlike in software programming where client requirements move all the time.<br>
When I glance at the chat discussions, and papers about lean, there seems to have been a lot of effort spent on performance problems with instance resolution, with unintended diamonds and cycles, with design choices about bundled definitions, about the hierarchy... Surely I can find a lot about why typeclasses are causing problems, but actually I can't find much about why having them is so great/why not having them is so bad.<br>
Now i'm certainly inexperienced and ignorant of all the history, I'm just throwing naive random thoughts as a newcomer. Were there past attempts at designing a mathlib without typeclasses? Are there papers/historical discussions/ list of examples on the usefulness of typeclasses in proof libraries?</p>

I'm very happy that I don't have to remind it of that fact all the time. And I'm also happy that I don't have to reprove every lemma for groups also for rings, commutative rings, division rings, fields, etc...</p>

<p>yes well it's what I have a hard time being convinced of... I have the feeling you pay a high price for  using them.  I don't think I'd mind writing a function to convert a structure to another and adding them lazily as needed.</p>

<p>Michael, you get a very biased view by only reading messages here. People talk about instance searches here only when they encounter issues. But this hiding millions of uses where everything works perfectly smoothly. The overall outcome is this system works incredibly well.</p>

<p>I don't know how to say it without sounding rude, so apologize in advance, but I think you're underestimating the complexity of mathematics. Carrying around explicit arguments would be a nightmare. Maybe Mario can do it in metamath, but that doesn't prove anything, and the goal of our work is not to make sure only Mario can use a proof assistant.</p>

<p>Yes I understand. People write a lot more about what they have to complain about, than about what they are happy with. But I wonder if it's really that much an advantage to not convert structures explicitly. Do you spend that big of a fraction of your time using lean, calling different lemmas on different representations of a same structure?</p>

<p>I think it's just a question of scale. Explicit dictionary passing works okay -- perhaps better in some ways -- for small examples, but it becomes a huge PITA  if you're working with bigger class hierarchies. Same for tactics versus proof terms. And scale issues are almost impossible to appreciate without experience because we always tend to think in small examples.</p>

<p>Yes later I want to try to make a small dissenting mathlib to see how it feels. I'm not completely convinced by my approach either, it would be an interesting experiment, if it wasn't done in that past.</p>

<p>I think it's great to ask questions like this (even though I am convinced typeclasses provide far, far more value than they cost). I think a cheap way to get some sense of what they're doing for us is just to use <code>set_option pp.implicit true</code> and look at the results.</p>

<p>I have mixed feelings about arguments of this form. While it's true that if you look at the terms that lean produces using typeclass inference that it would be hell to write that yourself, this isn't really a fair comparison because in the alternate world you would have short names for the relevant transitive instances. As Patrick alluded to, Metamath does things a little bit differently, and it basically boils down to having shortcut instances for common paths and using the lemma once per proof. When proofs are long this is a reasonable option since it is a small fraction of the full proof, but it is not incompatible with a prolog like proof search for these lemmas.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the reason lean and mathlib use typeclasses so extensively is because lean was literally designed to use typeclasses as the hammer to solve every problem. It has a huge home field advantage compared to alternatives that are more verbose and less automatic.</p>

<p>I'm not sure I know of a language that does this, but it might be interesting to explore resolving typeclasses by using a distance metric rather than priorities.  The idea would be rather than requiring programmers to pick a priority for the class (and higher priorities are chosen first), you assign a cost to using the class.  This would encourage the solver to take advantage of instances that provide path compression without requiring users to explicitly assign a global priority to each instance.</p>

<p>Ooh, that sounds quite interesting. Using Dijkstra on the hierarchy (-;</p>
