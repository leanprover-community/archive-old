<p>I made a list of links to various resources related to Lean: <a href="https://github.com/fpvandoorn/lean-links" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/fpvandoorn/lean-links">https://github.com/fpvandoorn/lean-links</a><br>
Hopefully this is useful to someone.</p>
<p>I'm probably missing some obvious things. Feel free to point them out here, or PR them there.</p>

<p>Maybe it's time to put up a list of things which we the community would like formalised. I am often being asked this on Twitter/email: "hey, I liked your game, I'm a mathematician, what needs doing?" I would like to be able to point people to a list and say "here's a bunch of stuff". I am envisaging the list containing everything from projects which a beginner with a mathematical background could think about (e.g. structure theorem for modules over a PID, uniqueness of factorisation of ideals into prime ideals in the integers of a number field, or other 3rd year / 4th year UG algebra stuff which I could probably attempt to supervise via Zulip) to wishlist stuff like Groebner bases which will take an expert. I've realised that I keep thinking of things and I never know where to put them. Maybe now is a good time to think of a place for such ideas and then people will be able to add stuff as necessary.</p>

<p>OK I'll take this on. There were some far more primitive "what is in Lean" pages which I wrote two years ago when I was trying to figure out what was in Lean by looking at every file in Lean and mathlib; I wrote some random blog posts but blog posts are manifestly more transient. At some point did these get ported over to some more official place? They will also need updating. But I think it's got to the point where we should have some brief informal descriptions of what we have and some wishlist.</p>

<p>I do think there's a relevant difference between Floris' list and what you're proposing. The list of resources is pretty stable. Individual items may get outdated, and there will be additions, but the list doesn't need frequent updating. Pages on "what's in mathlib" or "what should you work on" need regular attention, or else they'll be misleading.</p>

<p>How about a really detailed roadmap / wishlist of theorems? Sorted by dependency order, with each individual item being no more than say 100-300 theorems (so no "analysis" item, that's useless). If we just write it as a checklist, then it will be pretty stable going forward, we just check off items as they get done</p>

<p>for example, integral of functions R -&gt; C is what we need but mathlib is going for some more general notion over vector spaces. That's fine, as long as the theory applies painlessly to R -&gt; C. If it is not painless, then we need to specialize parts of the theory until this use case works</p>

<p>In the case of undergraduate analysis, you can pretty much pick up any calculus book to get the gist of the proofs (although formalization changes things), but at least I wouldn't have enough guidance given only the perfectoid roadmap. This is probably unavoidable for higher level mathematics, but in these cases, some pre-digestion of primary source materials (i.e. "etale cohomology of diamonds") is necessary, and is an important role played by the mathematicians writing the roadmap to prepare the way for "beginner + computer" (to paraphrase de bruijn) to be able to do the formalization work</p>

<p>I would not imagine the perfectoid roadmap been done by a math beginner, I would envisage it only being done by someone who knows the maths back to front. To be honest I would envisage it being done by either Johan or me, when we get round to it (it's not Patrick's speciality) , so I was really writing it for us. Another possibility is that a PhD student does it with me helping.</p>
<p>I think there are issues here which will only become clearer once I start writing the lists. I don't want to do this today (I want to do real number game stuff) but I do want to do it.</p>

<p>The thing is, writing careful informal proofs is something that practicing mathematicians already know how to do, and it is an important and valuable part of the formalization process. You don't see this as much at the undergrad level because careful mathematical proofs are copious, but for advanced and complex proofs I cannot stress enough how much difference a careful and straightforward informal proof makes in smoothing over the rough bits of big projects.</p>

<p>You could organize a todo list like that using github issues, but they seem a bit coarse-grained; you wouldn't want one issue for each element on that list, so you would have to split it down into topics or something. At least the way I've presented it, it seems like a mathlib .md file would be the nicest way to have a longish list of everything in the near future we care about (I'm thinking something like 100-200 entries total, sectioned according to topic)</p>

<p>I don't think the main difficulty with these things is where to host them. Pages on Kevin's blog, pages on the community site, GitHub issues or projects or wikis, it's all the same content. As long as it's visibly linked to from important places it will be found. The hard thing is actually keeping it up to date.</p>

<p>(By "these things" I mean the roadmaps and wishlists. Floris' list will be much simpler to maintain.)</p>

<p>At the minute the hard thing is finding the time to write the lists.</p>
