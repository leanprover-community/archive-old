<p>I have a student who can't run leanpkg on Windows: <code>leanpkg.bat new test</code> says: "failed to start child process", and doesn't create a new directory.</p>

<p>The fix would obviously be to wipe Windows and install a proper OS.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> one of my colleagues has experienced this. The simplest solution would be using Git Bash if Git is installed.</p>

<p>I've had several problems with git on Windows. There appears to be more than one canonical installation of git.</p>

<p>The mantra I tell Windows users is msys2, git, lean binary, set msys2 path variable so it can see git and leanpkg, then follow instructions in reference manual</p>

<p>We found yet another solution: activate the "Linux Subsystem for Windows", install the "Ubuntu" app, and use <code>elan</code> there. It was incredibly painless and fast (15 minutes?)</p>

<p>Any ideas what the "failed to start child process" might be due to? I am on Windows 10 and I get it when trying to use <code>leanpkg</code> for basically anything. I see that it originates in the C++ code base of Lean itself.</p>
<p>I saw some mentions of this issue in the mailing list, where it was mentioned that it occasionally happens, but for me I'm unable to do almost anything with <code>leanpkg</code>, which means I can't use <code>mathlib</code> as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>I might give using WSL a try, although I'm afraid that configuring VSCode might become a pain in that case.</p>

<p>I suppose another thing I could try is compiling Lean from source and hoping that that fixes the issue.</p>
