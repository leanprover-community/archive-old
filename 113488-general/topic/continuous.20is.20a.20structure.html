<p>Can someone explain me the rationale behind making <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/continuous">docs#continuous</a> a one-field structure? especially why <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/is_open_map">docs#is_open_map</a> in contrast isn't. I'm now defining spectral maps and have to decide whether I will follow the same path.</p>

<p>To be clear, spectral maps are continuous functions such that the preimage of a compact open set is compact (and open thanks to continuity). So I would say it makes sense to extend <code>continuous</code>, but I'd like your opinion.</p>

<p>the docs say "Registered as a structure to make sure it is not unfolded by Lean.", so I guess you want to figure out whether you want the definition to be easily unfoldable or not</p>

<p>The relevant PR is <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/5035">#5035</a> btw.</p>

<p>The main reason was the <code>apply</code> bug</p>

<p>I would guess that <code>is_open_map</code> is of the same age as <code>continuous</code> but it's never really used, so there was no need to change it to a structure</p>
