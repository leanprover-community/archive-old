<p>I am proud to announce a new edition of <strong>The Hitchhiker's Guide to Logical Verification</strong> based on Lean 3.20.0c and a recent <code>mathlib</code>. Two PDFs are available: <a href="https://github.com/blanchette/logical_verification_2020/raw/master/hitchhikers_guide.pdf">standard (A4)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/blanchette/logical_verification_2020/raw/master/hitchhikers_guide_tablet.pdf">optimized for tablets and ebook readers (A5)</a>.</p>
<p>The version of <code>mathlib</code> we use is slighly nonstandard (w.r.t. to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="256311">@Jannis Limperg</span>'s <code>induction'</code> and <code>cases'</code> tactics), but the PRs are underway, and it's not too hard to get used to <code>induction</code> and <code>cases</code> after having learned with the more novice-friendly primed versions.</p>

I'm really happy with all the energy you've been investing in this resource! I'm hoping I will be teaching a Lean course next summer, and I think this will be one of the two texts, next to MiL.</p>

<p>one item of feedback around learning tactics from written material like a book - I think it really helps to tell people that you must be using an environment that shows you the current goals, like vscode or emacs, in order to write tactics-based proofs</p>

<p>Ah I see. It never crossed my mind that these environments would work remotely well with Lean at all. Even with proof terms, you want to see the current goal (type). Anyway, the Hitchhiker's Guide does assume VS Code throughout.</p>
