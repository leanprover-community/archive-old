<p>Hey there! I've been doing some research on automated theorem proving in Lean, during which I encountered a problem: I want my machine learning model to store all the lemmas in the library and to have an ability to insert their names into generated code. <br>
The problem is that, in Lean, lemmas are members of namespaces which, in turn, can also be members of other nested namespaces. With that in mind, I have 2 questions.</p>
