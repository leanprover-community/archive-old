<p>A student on a new Windows machine gets <code>error: file 'init' not found in the search path</code> whatever Lean file they open. This also happens on the command line. I suspected that they'd corrupted their local Lean install (which was 3.45) so I told them to run <code>leanproject up</code> on the project they were working on (which then caused an install of 3.48), which I hoped would fix the problem, but it didn't. I have no idea what to suggest next.</p>

<p>The student has the Lean 3 extension installed. I just got them to <code>rm -rf .elan</code> and then open the project again; Lean was downloaded again and the error was still there. I am totally lost. You wouldn't believe what I've seen, dealing with undergraduate mathematicians. People accidentally edit <code>core.lean</code> or whatever, and I can always solve their problems (unless they're python-related, in which case I know people who can solve them). But this one really has me stumped. Any ideas? The laptop is new and the installation is new. I got the student to make a new one-line file just containing <code>def n := 37</code> and running Lean it on still gave the error about <code>init</code> not found.  And <code>lean --version</code> produced a sensible output.</p>
<p>The student gave me a cryptic comment about how the system had asked them about a file with a very long weird name (probably a hash) and asked if they wanted to replace it, or something odd happened or something; anyway I'm out of ideas.</p>

<p>Is there something uncommon about the user's home directory/user name? Length, special characters, or the like. Windows has a path length limit and some weird restrictions.</p>

<p>Would be nice to know where this hash-named file was located and what it was, too</p>

<p>Yes! This is a Chinese user with a unicode username!</p>

<p>I wonder if the "hash" is a mangled representation of the codepoints contained in the username. I also wonder if there's a particular character causing trouble, because I would guess  Chinese users would have faced this earlier (unless it's common to use generic placeholders or romanized usernames).</p>
