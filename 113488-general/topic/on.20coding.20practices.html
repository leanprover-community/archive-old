<p>Just reading this blogpost: <a href="https://flak.tedunangst.com/post/d2k19d2" target="_blank" title="https://flak.tedunangst.com/post/d2k19d2">https://flak.tedunangst.com/post/d2k19d2</a> by Ted Unangst. Contains the quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To return to the present, we canâ€™t just encapsulate everything or we end up with needless abstraction. But a useful technique is to leave a comment in the code noting which changes were more difficult than they should have been. If we return to this code, and have to make another such change, it may be time to redesign it. I thought this was useful. Experienced developers know where the pain points are in a codebase, but often this knowledge is hidden in the revision history where newcomers are unlikely to find it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like a good idea. I'll try to leave such comments in the future.</p>
