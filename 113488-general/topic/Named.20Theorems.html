<p>Could we establish a convention that "named theorems" for instance "Bézout's lemma" be distinguished by bolding the name in the theorem/lemma doc string, that is "<strong>Bézout's lemma</strong>" or "<strong>triangle inequality</strong>"?</p>

<p>OK, the PR for bolding named theorems was accepted into mathlib (my first!). Do we need to do the same for definitions, which would allow the creation of an index of standard math concepts using their normal names?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="397140">@Hunter Monroe</span> I guess that most mathlib definitions already use "normal names" quite closely. (E.g., a ring is a <code>ring</code> and a topological space is a <code>topological_space</code>.) So probably there is less direct benefit there. Do you have particular definitions in mind where you would want to apply this?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> there is a need for a far more comprehensive auto-generated index of definitions and theorems covered in mathlib, with their conventional names not the mathlib names, than provided on the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-overview.html">overview page</a>, which would: (1) be more thorough, for instance, by including probability concepts (present in the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad.html">undergrad page</a> but not the overview page), and (2) by being thorough, would make it obvious from a glance what is not covered, for instance, random variables, expected value, central limit theorem). Mathlib has outgrown the manually maintained overview and undergrad pages. The documentation does not fill this need, for instance, see the search results for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sitesearch=https%3A%2F%2Fleanprover-community.github.io%2Fmathlib_docs&amp;q=probability">probability</a>.</p>

<p>OK but the same shortcoming applies to graph theory, where it takes a good deal of work to determine that simple graphs are covered but not subgraphs and homomorphisms, and likewise for every other field of mathematics. Just as with theorems, bolding the name within the docstring could flag these for inclusion in auto-generated index--providing the human judgment.</p>

<p>That may be true at the moment, but I don't think we want to keep people from using bold in docstrings for a reason like this. Also, from the doc-gen point of view, I think it'll be easier to work with a list of declarations that have been tagged by an attribute than trying to parse bold text out of docstrings.</p>

<p>It might be worth considering now whether we want more metadata attached to notable theorems than just a name. We could maybe follow the current tactic doc functionality and have a user command which allows us to also include URLs, DOIs, etc.</p>

<p>For tagging definitions in mathlib, I prefer the bold (<strong>) approach--it is user friendly to tag a definition for indexing with no new tags to learn, inline tagging avoids repeating the concept name, and doc_gen can easily extract what is between the </strong>...** pair with a regular expression. URL/DOIs would be great not just for stacks but across multiple resources such as Wikipedia/MathWorld pages. I would like to see a free standing database of definitions/theorems that spans Lean, Isabelle, Coq, etc.</p>

<p>If we're looking at attribute-based tagging, perhaps overview.yml should be generated from attributes, which also has the advantage that moving a lemma doesn't break the yaml file</p>

<p>I guess the downside of that approach is that it's harder to bulk recategorize things</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="112680">Johan Commelin</span> there is a need for a far more comprehensive auto-generated index of definitions and theorems covered in mathlib, with their conventional names not the mathlib names, than provided on the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-overview.html">overview page</a>, which would: (1) be more thorough, for instance, by including probability concepts (present in the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad.html">undergrad page</a> but not the overview page), and (2) by being thorough, would make it obvious from a glance what is not covered, for instance, random variables, expected value, central limit theorem). Mathlib has outgrown the manually maintained overview and undergrad pages. The documentation does not fill this need, for instance, see the search results for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sitesearch=https%3A%2F%2Fleanprover-community.github.io%2Fmathlib_docs&amp;q=probability">probability</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not convinced at all, especially by the idea of collecting things based on visual markup (<code>**</code> tags). I think we're pretty far from having exhausted the capacity of manual overview pages. We simply need more PRs adding stuff to the overview.</p>
