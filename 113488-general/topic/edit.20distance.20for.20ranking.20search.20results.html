<p>I've actually never implemented any text search algorithm myself so I wouldnt know, but if it turns out to work nicely in doc-gen I dont see why we shouldnt port it to doc-gen4 as well.</p>

<p>At least for the way I search, (unweighted) edit distance works very poorly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Often I don't know or don't want to write the correct namespace.  Say I know the lemma is called <code>add_is_o</code> but forgot the namespace, I want the search to return <code>asymptotics.is_O.add_is_o</code> (sixth hit atm).  Edit distance penalizes the missing namespace enormously, making <code>rel_iso</code> a better match.</li>
<li>Similarly, I'm lazy and don't want to write the whole lemma name.  The search should give me reasonable results even if I just write a prefix.  If I want to know something about the union of dynkin systems, then <code>dynkunion</code> should help me out.  (four hits at the moment, all relevant)</li>
<li>I really don't want the search to ignore my query.  If I type <code>eq</code> then I want something about equalities!  However e.g. <code>or</code> is only a distance of 2 away.  Similarly <code>mul</code> is closer to <code>add</code> than <code>addition</code> in edit distance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for testing and for the insights, Gabriel!<br>
I hadn't thought about testing locally. I thought we'd need to deploy the demo before being able to test it.</p>

<p>If we're interested in improving search results, note that <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/doc-gen/pull/131">doc-gen#131</a> is still open. There are some outstanding issues -- apparently it's very slow to load, and the 404 page needs to be fixed</p>

<p>It was already very slow compared to the old version of doc-gen, but the search (start up) has gotten an order of magnitude or two faster last week.  I'm not sure how much we can or want to salvage from 131 anymore.</p>

<p>At the same time, it's a much more complete search. Maybe it could be an opt-in ("full search" or something) but I still think it's valuable.</p>

<p>For instance, searching for "pythagorean" doesn't turn up anything about the Pythagorean theorem right now. I don't have a build of 131 to test whether <code>pythagorean_triple</code> outweighs the real answer on that search, but searching for "pythagorean theorem" should certainly turn up what you'd want.</p>

<p>I'm trying to achieve improvements without big code shake ups. More specifically, I'm more interested in the similarity metric/heuristic per se. I'm very happy to know that what we have on master is fast and provides good results (that could clearly beat a common metric like edit distance)</p>

<p>Right now, it seems that using whitespace causes a bug in the search and it doesn't return any result</p>

<p>I also like that it searches the docstrings as well.  The goals of the PR are certainly great!</p>
<p>But I'm very concerned about the actual implementation.  As Eric noted, the performance is really problematic and I can confirm that it takes more than half a minute to start up on my laptop at 100% CPU.  The google search is more realistic than that.  (Then there's also some minor stuff like the javascript creating html by string concatenation, and further polishing like enabling line wrapping, making the search auto-update again, making the filter menu non-modal, etc.  But the performance is really the main issue here.)</p>
<p>I don't think merging the PR in its current state will make the documentation more useful.  One realistic option might be to just take the changes to <code>print_docs.py</code> and <code>searchWorker.js</code> and hook them up to a new "full search" button.</p>
<p>There are useful insights from the PR though.  For example, it is surprisingly cheap to ship more search information in addition to the declaration name.  The declaration list is 1 megabyte gzipped, if we add module names &amp; docstrings that's only 2 megabytes.  It might also be possible to add declaration types.</p>

<p>The thing I care most about in the PR is searching doc strings! (And tactic docs/library notes/etc?) Secondly, the UI and filtering.</p>

<p>I'm enjoying the search too. Sometimes the results are a bit oblique, though. I was just searching <code>shadow</code>, and the first result is <code>complex_shape.down</code>, but <code>finset.shadow</code> (which is what I was looking for) doesn't make the list.</p>
