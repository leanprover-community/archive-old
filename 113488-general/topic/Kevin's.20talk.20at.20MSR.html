<p>I also barely understand this stuff. As far as I can tell, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> 's §3.1.2 is talking about how you can perform a reduction <code>t ⟿ u</code> such that Lean's typechecker will say that the types are not equal <code>a ⇎ b</code>, but which are actually equal if you added transitivity in <code>a ≡ b</code>. Which doesn't sound that bad. But ppedrot in the issue seems to be talking about subject reduction breaking because of adding in <code>quot.lift f _ (quot.mk a) ~~&gt; f a</code>.</p>

<p>I wrote a response, but I'm wondering whether I should post it there. I don't want to cause a flame war. However, I also don't see the email address of Pierre-Marie Pédrot anywhere publicly, so that I can discuss this in private.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi, long-term Lean user here. I don't want to start a flame war, but I just want to address @ppedrot's concern about quotients causing a failure of subject reduction.</p>
<p>The reason that quotients cause a failure of subject reduction is a historical design issue with quotients, and not anything that comes up in practice. The problem is the interaction between quotients and definitional proof irrelevance (which Lean has for its bottom universe <code>Prop</code>). The problem is that quotients can be defined for types in all universes, even for propositions. In this case, we can get a failure of subject reduction (described <a href="https://github.com/digama0/lean-type-theory/releases/download/v1.0/main.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/digama0/lean-type-theory/releases/download/v1.0/main.pdf">here</a>).</p>
<p>Note that taking a quotient of a proposition is a useless operation, because all propositions are already subsingletons. We only take quotients of types that are not in <code>Prop</code> in practice, and the problem doesn't occur there.</p>
<p>Ideally, we would remove the ability to take quotients of propositions from Lean. This would remove this failure of subject reduction (there is still another failure with inductive families of propositions + proof irrelevance) and would not decrease the usability of quotients.</p>

<p>Does Lean obey, vaguely, a sort of weakened form of subject reduction? For example, that one can always exhibit an <code>Id(a,b)</code> if <code>t: a --&gt; u: b</code>.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="128280">@Wojciech Nawrocki</span> The "weakened" subject reduction is that <code>≡</code> in Mario's paper satisfies subject reduction. I think this translates to "if <code>t</code> reduces to <code>u</code>, and <code>t : A</code> then you have to apply a finite number of type ascriptions <code>(... : T)</code> to subterms of <code>u</code> and that term will have type <code>A</code>." (EDIT: as Mario pointed out below you need to use <code>@id T ...</code> instead)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, because the algorithmic equality just fails transitivity. So if you give each intermediate step manually (so that the algorithm doesn't have to apply transitivity itself), then Lean can type-check it. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> can you confirm?</p>

<p>Unfortunately this doesn't literally work in lean, because the elaborator only uses type ascriptions for elaboration, and does not pass that info along to the kernel. But you can make it work if you use <code>id</code> or <code>show</code> to do the type ascription instead</p>

Is there any place where if we're interested in special functions, algorithms, or <br>
 differential equations we can help prove some stuff in lean? or has that work mostly been taken over?</p>
