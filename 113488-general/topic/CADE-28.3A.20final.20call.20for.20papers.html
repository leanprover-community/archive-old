<p>The 28th International Conference on Automated Deduction (CADE-28)<br>
Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA. 11-16th July 2021.<br>

In cooperation with ACM SIGLOG &lt;<a href="https://siglog.acm.org">https://siglog.acm.org</a>&gt;</p>
<p>CADE-28 will be virtual due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>CADE is the major international forum for presenting research on all aspects of<br>
automated deduction. High-quality submissions on the general topic of automated<br>
deduction, including logical foundations, theory and principles, applications<br>
in and beyond STEM, implementations, and the use/contribution of automated<br>
deduction in AI, are solicited. CADE-28 aims to present research that reflects<br>
the broad range of interesting and relevant topics in automated deduction.</p>
<p>Important Dates</p>
<p>Abstract deadline: 15 February 2021<br>
Submission deadline: 22 February 2021 (AoE, no extensions)<br>
Rebuttal phase: 29-31 March 2021<br>
Notification: 9 April 2021<br>
Final version: 30 April 2021<br>
Conference: 12-15 July 2021</p>
<p>Submissions can be made in two categories:</p>
<p>Regular papers. Up to 15 pages in LNCS style. Proofs of theoretical results<br>
that do not fit in the page limit may be provided in an appendix. Reviewers<br>
may consider additional material in appendices, but submissions must be self-<br>
contained within the page limit.</p>
<p>Short papers (including system descriptions, user experiences, domain models,<br>
etc.) Up to 10 pages in LNCS style.<br>
Submissions must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere.<br>
They will be judged on relevance, originality, significance, correctness, and<br>
readability. If software or data is relevant to a paper, a link that provides<br>
access to the software/data must be provided to enable reproduction of results.<br>
The review process will include a feedback/rebuttal period where authors will<br>
have the option to respond to reviewer comments. The PC chairs may solicit<br>
further reviews after the rebuttal period.</p>
<p>The proceedings of the conference will be published in the Springer LNCS/LNAI<br>
series. Formatting instructions and the LNCS style files can be obtained at<br>
