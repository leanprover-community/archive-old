<p>I'm thinking about buying a new Mac laptop to replace my struggling 2013 MacBook Pro.  If you were speccing out a machine that's primarily intended for mathlib work, what would you be looking for?  For example (and sorry for the very basic questions!): </p>
<ul>
<li>Should I be looking to get more memory or more CPU/GPU cores?</li>
<li>Is there a threshold on memory or cores beyond which I won't see any noticeable benefit, or can VSCode use whatever I can throw at it?</li>
<li>I saw that some people were having issues with getting things set up on M1 machines.  Are these issues generally resolved now?</li>
<li>If you're using a Mac, what are you using?</li>
<li>If you've upgraded from an old Mac to a new one have you seen appreciable improvements in performance when working on mathlib, or should I lower my expectations?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you only care about running one lean project at a time, 16~20 GB RAM should be fine. Maxing out on CPU will help a lot, there's a lot of stuff that can be parallelized when building Lean projects. GPU isn't helpful at the moment.</p>

<p>I'm assuming that even with a powerful new computer I would still be relying on pushing stuff up to GitHub and letting the remote machine do the heavy work, rather than recompiling mathlib locally?</p>

<p>For completeness, I'm on an M1 MacBook Air with no upgrades == 8GB RAM, and have no real complaints honestly, but I do do a lot less work than others so it's possible I'd be more frustrated if I did. If I have a need to compile mathlib I do it on a beefier machine, or really I let GH do it and just pull the oleans, but I compile lean, lean4 and friends regularly.</p>

<p>My data point. I had a M1 Macbook Air with 8 gb and building all mathlib was not possible. I now have a MacBook Pro with an M1 max with 64gb and it takes a little under an hour to build mathlib. </p>
<p>My belief, from experience and looking at other benchmarking, is that the processor bump from M1 to M1 max would not be seriously noticeable for these tasks.</p>

I have the impression that the 6 cores/6 threads of the desktop are faster than the 4 cores/8 threads of the MacBook, so upgrading a CPU definitely makes sense to me.</p>

<p>Can I use reported benchmarks to extrapolate anything about the day-to-day experience of doing mathlib work?  For example, I'm looking at a computer whose single-core Geekbench scores are 2-3 times better than my current machine, and whose multi-core scores are 6-8 times better.  So, for example, when I edit a file and I'm waiting for the orange bar to chug through, should I expect it to go about twice as fast, or 7 times faster — or is there nothing informative that can be said about this?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="422543">@Stuart Presnell</span> Lean 3 has features to process multiple parts of a single file in parallel, so it might go above 2-3x, but I am guessing it depends on how independent parts of the file are, and it would not be by much. That is, is it a sequence of lemmas where each depends on the previous - not very parallelisable - or a bunch of more independent definitions - maybe it can go above 3x. Where multicore really helps is building whole projects such as mathlib, since then many files can be processed in parallel. Lean 4 processes single files sequentially, so as far as a single elaboration pass is concerned it could not go above 3x, although having more cores still helps the editing experience - we handle changes to the file and various requests such as printing the goal using all the available cores.</p>

<p>I did some benchmarking when I set up the benchmarking bot and my experience was that the mathlib build does not scale super well beyond 4 cores. 6-8 still got faster, but not by as much as one would expect. Things might have changed since then, of course, but I would prioritise single-core performance if you have a choice.</p>

<p>I think Lean 3 checks proofs of lemmas in parallel, after elaborating their statements (and definitions). A proof cannot depend in another proof in Lean (unfortunately it can in informal maths).</p>

<p>Parallel proof compilation could be added as a future optimization, but I believe it was decided not to add it for now because it introduces lots of engineering complexity and the gain is not as great as it might seem. In practice one cannot just elaborate the statement first and then move on with the proof, as the full statement might <em>depend</em> on the proof. Here is a silly contrived example of where we must descend into the proof term to find out which assumptions to pick up.</p>

<p>No, inspecting the (final) proof term is what makes it <em>work</em> with arbitrary tactics, and is what Lean 4 does in contrast to Lean 3's lexical analysis of the surface syntax. Thus there is no need for an <code>include</code> statement in Lean 4.</p>

<p>Does it mean you chose to avoid needing <code>include</code> rather than allowing parallel proof checking?</p>

<p>Because I would clearly choose the other option (favoring parallel proof checking and using <code>include</code> from times to times).</p>

<p>No, that was a distant secondary reason for removing parallel checking. The main reason was that it's complex to implement, and we wanted to do better than Lean 3's hacky implementation. But as Wojciech, I am somewhat optimistic that it could return in the future, preferably after we measure its potential impact on e.g. mathlib4.</p>

<p>Ok, thanks. That seemed a very weird reason to drop parallel checking. And indeed I may be imagining only that parallel checking is crucial. We'll see when measurement will be available.</p>
