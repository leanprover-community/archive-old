<p>let's say i need to use Algorithm X in my new tactic. Algorithm X can't be implemented efficiently in Lean but it can be implemented efficiently in C. how can i write a tactic in C and use it in Lean? is it even possible? i think it should be because the gptf tactic uses the OpenAI API, which is of course not a Lean feature</p>

<p>I've watched the metaprogramming video in the Logical Verification course so i think i know the basics</p>

<p>The short answer is that lean tactics have io.  So you can run command line stuff and process the results.  See <a href="https://agentultra.github.io/lean-for-hackers/">https://agentultra.github.io/lean-for-hackers/</a>.  Also see other posts by me mentioning “io”.</p>

<p>Since you mentioned it, <code>gptf</code> specifically works by running a <code>curl</code> command via the command line which sends a request to the openai API (over the internet).  You can similarly run a local script via the command line or communicate with a locally running process.  This io interface is largely undocumented (except through the lean code and random posts here on Zulip).  Also, there is now built in support for JSON parsing in lean which makes this communication easier.  (But again, no good documentation.)</p>

<p>Another answer is: use/wait for Lean 4, and search for "FFI" here on zulip to find discussions about how to connect to external C code.</p>
