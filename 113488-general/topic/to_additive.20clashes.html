<p>While porting, we are discovering that several multiplicative statements are being mapped to the same additive statement.<br>
I don't know how to modify <code>to_additive</code>, but I think it should error when a decl already exists.<br>
And then we pass a <code>+force</code> flag to make it shut up, so that the following still works</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">some_mul_thing</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">foobar</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">baz</span>

<span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">some_add_thing</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">fooquux</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">bumsdings</span>

<span class="kn">attribute</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">to_additive</span> <span class="bp">+</span><span class="n">force</span> <span class="n">some_add_thing</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="n">some_mul_thing</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Maybe something more self-explanatory e.g. <code>[to_additive as_existing some_add_thing]</code></p>

<p>Additivizing a declaration to an additive declaration that already exists is quite common: sometimes <code>@[to_additive]</code> is not good enough to translate the declaration automatically (this happens basically with all lemmas that involve powers that should be translated to <code>smul</code>).</p>
<p>In rare cases it's even useful to have multiple multiplicative declarations that map to the same additive declaration (so one of the <code>to_additive</code> calls will then refer to an existing declaration. I responded in <a href="#narrow/stream/287929-mathlib4/topic/to_additive.20align.20failures/near/323303372">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/287929-mathlib4/topic/to_additive.20align.20failures/near/323303372</a> why this is sometimes useful. </p>
<p>I agree that it might be good to have a syntax for the cases where the additive declaration already exists. I think this can be a Lean 4-only thing? It's easy to implement if we decide on a syntax.</p>

<p>(I actually want to implement something similar for <code>simps</code> where in some cases it will run in "expensive mode", which can be slow in certain cases. I want to add a token like <code>simps!</code> that runs in expensive mode.)</p>
