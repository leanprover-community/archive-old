<p>I think I use <code>leanproject</code> in a very different way to Patrick and I've always found it difficult to explain to him the problems I'm having. I use leanproject to manage multi-user projects with mathlib as a dependency, and when someone in my team bumps mathlib there can be problems for the other people. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> you will probably tell me that if I see this error when I am using leanproject then I've done something wrong:</p>

<p>But I claim that I have done nothing wrong. What has happened here is that there has been a bump of mathlib recently which seems to have deleted <code>ring.lean</code> and replaced it with <code>ring/*</code>; the <code>default.lean</code> trick is to ensure that code doesn't break when mathlib is updated. But it breaks for me anyway because someone else changed the toml, so my understanding is that I cannot at this point use <code>leanproject up</code> because this will change the toml again and I don't want to do this; I am not in the mood for bumping, mathlib has just been bumped in this project a few days ago and my co-author has it compiling with lean. Currently in <code>_target/deps/mathlib/src/algebra</code> I have <code>ring.lean</code> and <code>ring.olean</code> and <code>ring/basic.lean</code> and my toml says that my version of mathlib should have no file called ring.lean. How can I make leanproject get rid of it?</p>
<p>Patrick I don't think you see this situation because you are typically either working on mathlib (where <code>leanproject up</code> is essentially always the right thing to do because you're tracking a branch) or working on a single-user project which has mathlib as a dependency. All this stuff is being ignored by git and we have some branches which are working with one version of mathlib and some with a different version, because only master got bumped, and I think the system cannot handle this. But my problem is that user1 bumped mathlib and now user2 has a broken local installation through no fault of their own because <code>leanproject get-mathlib-cache</code> does not seem to remove out of date lean files. </p>
<p>I think I want a command which simply deletes _target and re-installs mathlib + oleans from the version in the toml. This seems to me to be a failsafe workaround.</p>
<p>Deleting oleans doesn't fix it</p>

<p>OK so I just checked this with guinea pig user3. user1 had bumped mathlib in master on github and user3 has not<br>
yet updated. If they do <code>git pull</code> and then <code>leanproject get-mathlib-cache</code> on leanproject v0.0.8 and then they have both <code>ring.lean</code> and <code>ring/default.lean</code> in <code>algebra</code>. But this complaint is currently on hold because perhaps you changed it on 0.0.9</p>

<p>Could you please try with 0.0.10? I would really like to help you here.</p>

<p>Here is a question which we can try with 0.0.10. I have a repo and different branches are on different mathlib commits. For one branch algebra/ring.lean exists, and for another one <code>algebra/ring/basic.lean</code> exists. Here is what I thought was a reasonable usage of leanproject (I'm using 0.0.10):</p>

<p>After <code>leanproject get-mathlib-cache</code> I have both <code>ring.lean</code> and <code>ring/basic.olean</code></p>

<p>I would just tell my users to reclone with <code>leanproject get</code>, which of course works, but some of them have branches which they haven't pushed</p>

<p>the thing i would do is commit and push (maybe to a separate branch), and then nuke, re-clone, and delete extra files / sort out merge conflicts by hand. This tactic is maybe more error-prone than you would like, but it was enough to get out of the messes i made for myself while refactoring data/polynomial.</p>

<p>Yes, I agree that my advice is too brittle to routinely give to undergrads.</p>
