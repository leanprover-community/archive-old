<p>The CoCalc talk in another thread reminded me that I should start getting things ready for my course next year. This led to a chat with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="128565">@Harald Schilly</span> about how CoCalc installs Lean/mathlib. Irrelevant for my course, but probably relevant to others, so I'm bringing it here.</p>
<p>It would probably be good to install Lean through the version manager elan, with a reasonable default version (3.5.1?) and a handful of options pre-installed. Right now it's a plain install of a 3.4.2 binary.</p>
<p>What about pre-installing versions of mathlib? leanpkg has a notion of a global install of a package. But I'm not sure it's the best move here. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110043">@Gabriel Ebner</span> doesn't think it will play well with elan. And it probably interacts badly with non-global mathlib dependencies, which people might use if they want a newer version than whatever CoCalc gives.</p>
<p>CoCalc could provide directories containing (compiled) mathlibs for each Lean version it pre-installs. Users would have to set up projects with leanpkg.toml files pointing to the right spot. Fine for courses that can distribute this project, trickier for someone who just wants to open a .lean file in CoCalc and start using real numbers.</p>
<p>As I understand it, free CoCalc doesn't allow accessing external websites. So adding packages from GitHub won't work, nor will elan on new versions of Lean, nor will cache-olean/update-mathlib. This is why I'm suggesting pre-installing things, although of course this a reason to pay for CoCalc :) </p>
<p>Thoughts? ( cc <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="116034">@William Stein</span> )</p>

<p>I can tell you that by default it is very confusing for people to get access to mathlib on CoCalc if they aren't experts.   We CoCalc admins definitely do NOT know what to do in order to make mathlib (or other libraries?) available by default, though we've tried and failed repeatedly.    If you want to see precisely what our lean install is on cocalc now, just open a Terminal in any cocalc project (+New --&gt; Terminal), then type <code>cd /ext/lean</code> and <code>ls</code>:</p>

<p>Note that we have a copy of mathlib but it's not in either of the directories of the default lean search path, which might be why it doesn't work.  Should we move it into a subdirectory called "library"?</p>

<p>The <code>library</code> subdirectory is for the core Lean library. I'm guessing you'd have trouble moving mathlib there. With your current setup, you can do the following:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>~$ leanpkg install /ext/lean/lean-3.4.2-linux/mathlib-lean-3.4.2/
</pre></div>


<p>(don't do it inside <code>/ext/lean/lean-3.4.2-linux/</code>, apparently). This is a global install of mathlib so it should be available whenever you open a Lean file -- you might need  to restart the Lean server if it was running already.</p>

<p>One can think that users of CoCalc don't need many versions of mathlib (they would use Lean locally if they were that serious about it). But I'm worried for teachers: what if I start a course using mathlib and suddenly CoCalc updates mathlib? What I did last year was to distribute a compiled mathlib using CoCalc distribution mechanism. Let's dream a bit here. Let's say some script downloads a mathlib nightly on the first of every month and call it <code>mathlib_january</code> etc. Then users could add a leanpkg dependency to <code>mathlib_february</code> or something. Then every year automatically erases ancient mathlibs.</p>

<p>This shouldn't be a Lean specific issue however. What happens to existing projects when Sage is updated? I guess Sage has some breaking changes from times to times.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>We keep all past versions of Sage, and have a sage_select command so users can choose a default.  Right now things are extra complicated because the last Sage update was python2 --&gt; python3!    With Jupyter the situation is very good since there is no default sage version  for Jupyter notebooks  -- you have to explicitly choose a version the first time, and then it defaults to that afterwards and is encoded in the ipynb file, so you get that version henceforth when using that notebook.  If an instructor prepares course materials with Sage-8.9, then all students will be using sage-8.9 when they open that notebook, even if we installed sage-9.1... unless sage-8.9 isn't available and then they get a message and select from the closes related kernel.       This is one thing  Jupyter really got right. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We do have several point in time <em>snapshots</em> of the entire (several hundred GB) install stack for a project, which can be selected in project settings.  Then no matter what upgrades happen for a default cocalc project, they don't happen for that project.   People asked for this, but in practice don't use it much -- for most software, people tend to prefer the newest version with whatever bugfixes are in it (plus documentation parity with the web) to a static version.   We also have many completely custom images (using the mybinder spec) and some classes use this for the whole class.    We could do more to make this more straightforward to use though.</p>

<p>ok, I tried that <code>leanpkg install ...</code>and all that happened was it changed files in my <code>$HOME/.lean</code> directory.</p>
<p>So, just to clarify: what we here at cocalc aim for is to have lean + mathlib + other libs (if there is a need) at a global location, which is read-only. That directory is accessible from each and every project on cocalc. Then, when lean starts, it should pick up that global mathlib. With Linux or Python, it is possible to tweak a <code>PATH</code> or <code>PYTHONPATH</code> variable, containing a list of directories where it should search for binaries or a library. I suppose with LEAN there is nothing like that and you have to configure this in your local directory? If that's the case, this might only work if we install mathlib + other libs in that <code>builtin_path</code> directory (I saw that in a <code>leanpkg.path</code> file)</p>

<p>Note: Rob points out that some of this post is incorrect</p>
<p>I think <code>install</code> is how a user installs dependencies for their project. For example many mathematics projects have a dependency on mathlib. The <code>install</code> command, for me, would edit <code>leanpkg.toml</code> to indicate that my project relies on mathlib (or more precisely on a certain commit of mathlib). Then <code>leanpkg configure</code> would download that particular commit and put it into <code>_target</code>, and then, if you have all the user tools installed, <code>update-mathlib</code> would download compiled binaries for the version of mathlib you chose. </p>
<p>Having a stable version of Lean is eminently sensible. 3.5.1 is just a bugfix for 3.4.2 really, I think, so you should probably use that. But I have always downloaded my own mathlibs when using lean on cocalc, because different project rely on different things and mathlib changes can be non-backwards-compatible.</p>

<p>Hmm. When you're outside a Lean project (ie no leanpkg.toml in a directory below you), the <code>leanpkg_path_file</code> value shown by <code>lean --path</code> is different. It doesn't exist on my machine. I wonder if creating that file would act as a "default" path file, and what exactly needs to go in to direct it to a default mathlib install.</p>

<p>I could make it so that when cocalc is about to start the lean server it first checks to see if ~/.lean is empty, and in that case runs <code>leanpkg install /ext/lean/lean-3.4.2-linux/mathlib-lean-3.4.2/</code>.  Then mathlib would work for random users (esp without internet access on cocalc), but if anybody needs to do something custom, they can just delete and customize ~/.lean however they want and it won't get touched.</p>

<p>Anyway, making a change to run a leanpkg install of mathlib when first running lean wouldn't be too hard...  it also doesn't waste disk space.</p>

<p>My main motivation is new students and random people who want to solve some problems using mathlib + lean that say <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span>  tweets about.   They wouldn't have access to github if they are using cocalc for free, and anyways it would be nice to avoid the friction of opening a terminal and using <code>leanpkg add</code>.

<p>If one does <code>leanpkg install /ext/lean/lean-3.4.2-linux/mathlib-lean-3.4.2/</code> in a clean account, then later does <code>leanpkg add ...</code>, what happens?   Maybe the second command gives them the latest mathlib version and all is good?</p>

<p>Okay, I think you're safe with this setup. Run <code>leanpkg install /ext/...</code> in/below <code>~</code>. If someone creates a Lean project anywhere in <code>~</code>, the new <code>leanpkg.path</code> seems to override the global install. This happens whether or not mathlib is added to the project with <code>leanpkg add</code>. The global install is unavailable in the project as soon as the project is created.</p>

<p>I implemented this and it is NOW live in CoCalc.  mathlib will "just work" with no manual intervention by users for any newly started (or restarted) project that doesn't already have a ~/.lean directory.   In particular, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> you could post lean files on <a href="http://share.cocalc.com" target="_blank" title="http://share.cocalc.com">share.cocalc.com</a> that rely on mathlib, and when people open that content (e.g, as an anonymous user), it'll work (or at least lack of mathlib won't be the issue).</p>
<p>Here's an example on the share server: <a href="https://share.cocalc.com/share/df81e09e5b8f16f28b3a2e818dcdd4560e7818ae/support/2020-02-19-lean-natural-numbers.lean?viewer=share" target="_blank" title="https://share.cocalc.com/share/df81e09e5b8f16f28b3a2e818dcdd4560e7818ae/support/2020-02-19-lean-natural-numbers.lean?viewer=share">https://share.cocalc.com/share/df81e09e5b8f16f28b3a2e818dcdd4560e7818ae/support/2020-02-19-lean-natural-numbers.lean?viewer=share</a></p>
<p>If somebody clicks the green button to open the document it should work, automatically adding support for mathlib on first use of lean and they will see this:</p>

<p>thank you, I discovered that already. However, regarding mathlib, my impression is that it is fine to grab the master-tip of the repository, but there are also "snapshot" like releases in it's repo. Last one from Oct'19, though. I'm aware of that mathlib-tool, and reading the sources of that script, it looks like grabbing the nightly build is what I should do. For me, as an "outsider" to lean, this is a little bit confusing ^^</p>

<p>Using the master tip of mathlib is fine, if you're building it yourself. There are supporting scripts for downloading pre-built olean files. But there's no need to install them in CoCalc. You could do it locally to create the mathlib image if you wanted.</p>

<p>thank you <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110596">@Rob Lewis</span> … yes, it's different. So, what I ended up is writing a script to grab the latest nightly build of mathlib from the mathlib-nightly repo. Just one minor detail was off: it extracts as "src/*" without these two toml and path files. I ended up writing them on my own, without specifying the lean version. With what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="116034">@William Stein</span> came up with will point to the matlib path, which will be next to the default version of lean we at cocalc symlink to. Therefore, the mathlib package will correspond to whatever the default version is, i.e. 3.5.1 right now.</p>

<p>The ticke is still open, so I assume the server starts in the home directory. </p>
<p>One question about the logic: if running <code>lean -p</code> in the directory where the <code>.lean</code> file is says <code>is_user_leanpkg_path</code> is <code>true</code> → start the lean server in <code>$HOME</code>. If it is <code>false</code> → start it in the directory where <code>leanpkg_path_file</code> is. Correct?</p>

<p>Can you clarify this? Do you mean that a panel off to the right is displaying something when it shouldn't?  What's a minimal example to reproduce this?    CoCalc just takes exactly the same LSP language server protocol data as VSCode and displays it, though how it does so is different.</p>

<p>Thanks.  In VSCode how does one display the help?      In CoCalc it would probably be very easy to change things so that the help is always displayed in a completely separate panel, and if you don't want to see it, you just close that panel...   Would that work for you?</p>

<p>I've just released the software update, that includes the newer lean/mathlib setup. So, in CoCalc, projects have a "software environment" setting (in project settings → project control). "Default" is what I just updated and if your project is still running from before the update, you have to restart it to get the update. If you're set to "Experimental", you're one step ahead and use what will be the Default soon.</p>

<p>when you open it (anonymously, or a fresh project), cocalc's lean editor will start, notices that there is no config in ~/.lean and creates it (that's what william coded up one or two days ago).</p>

<p>quick update from my perspective at cocalc: I tried to upgrade to lean 3.6.0 + mathlib 2020-02-27 nightly, but it doesn't work. I have no idea why. The symptoms are high (never ending) cpu usage and then it fails with "excessive memory usage error" or the whole cocalc interface is unresponsive. So, something must have changed that causes an issue. Hence there won't be 3.6.0 on cocalc for now.</p>

<p>One thing you could try is this: upgrade the Lean binary to 3.6, upgrade the mathlib Lean files, and then compile them yourself with <code>lean --make src</code> in the mathlib root directory. It will take a while but it might be the easiest way to just make everything work.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="137337">@Harald Schilly</span> If you're installing versions of Lean manually (i.e. you're not using the version manager <code>elan</code>), you'll always need to check by hand that your lean and mathlib versions match.

<p>hi, I am trying to update lean + mathlib on CoCalc. When I looked into this the last time, I wrote a script to get the latest nightly mathlib build, but somehow it stopped being updated. That makes me suspicious.  If I download the latest nightly of mathlib, is there a way for me to know, for which version of lean it is? (there is no toml file in it)</p>

<p>The overview is: you shouldn't install Lean, you should install <code>elan</code> which is a tool which works out which version of Lean you should be using, and if necessary downloads it. For CoCalc you might want to consider downloading all ten or so recent versions of Lean, or you might want to offer one by default and let users download more if they want. I had problems with sharing Lean projects on CoCalc precisely because they were written with the wrong version of Lean (and new Lean releases come at the rate of one per month right now, which is not a problem for us because of elan but which might be a problem for CoCalc if it doesn't want to adopt elan).</p>

<p>Speaking personally, as a Lean user I want the world. I want to be able to develop using bleeding edge Lean and bleeding edge mathlib on CoCalc, and I want the <code>leanpkg.toml</code> file in my Lean project to tell CoCalc which version of Lean and mathlib to use. Furthermore, if I share a Lean file, perhaps one which depends on a local installation of mathlib in my Lean project in my CoCalc project, and runs on Lean 3.9.0 because I didn't update to 3.11 yet, it would be brilliant if this <em>just worked</em>.</p>

<p>Here is the reason that you at CoCalc might be motivated to make the system so flexible: if I have a Lean project stored on CoCalc and I want to share one file with the world, and this file has other local files as imports as well as mathlib imports, then currently there is no easy way for me to do this unless I set up my own web editor. CoCalc will be fussy about which version of Lean I use, and which version of mathlib, and I never figured out how to get it to play well with local imports unless I zipped up the entire project and shared it as a zip file, which is very inefficient; start-up times are already bad. Your main rival is the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-web-editor/">Lean Web Editor</a> and here I can share a file given e.g. its URL, but the only imports I am allowed are imports from mathlib. The mathlib is very up to date though. This means that a sharing of a file might break if I don't maintain it.</p>

<p>thank you for all the explanations. there are certain constraints which make some aspects impossible. so, one solution could be that there is no default lean on cocalc any more and therefore simple sharing of lean projects will not work out of the box.</p>

<p>How does sharing work? Here is what I could imagine. One looks for a file and sees if it is in some directory which contains a <code>leanpkg.toml</code> file, and if it is then it reads the version of Lean from the toml file. This is exactly what <code>elan</code> does if I'm not mistaken.</p>

<p>What I have been doing in CoCalc is that all my projects live in different directories and each one has a different mathlib in it</p>

<p>I don't like creating an extra distribution system to make it easier to use mathlib in an unsupported way.  You can get the almost the same thing as the mathlib nightlies by running <code>leanproject get mathlib</code> (instead of downloading a zip file from the release page).</p>

<p>so, elan is not easy to install either. there is just one script (something from rust?) and I would have to audit what it is doing before I can run it. it would be better if there is somewhere a short explanation what it is supposed to do or few steps to do it manually.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can compile <code>elan</code> yourself.  It builds a small rust program called <code>elan-init</code>.  You then just need to install it to <code>/usr/bin/elan-init</code> and then symlink <code>elan-init</code> to <code>/usr/bin/elan</code>, <code>/usr/bin/lean</code>, <code>/usr/bin/leanpkg</code>, and <code>/usr/bin/leanchecker</code> if you're installing it manually.</p>

<p>ok, I'll try that. installing elan on cocalc isn't supported, because it want's to download files into the user's home directory – but it must be global. I could try moving files around, but who knows if that will help at all.</p>

<p>By default, elan will look for toolchains in <code>~/.elan</code>.  I would suggest that you preinstall all Lean versions (like every single one from 3.4.2 to 3.11.0).  You can either symlink <code>~/.elan</code> to <code>/opt/elan</code>, or set the environment variable <code>ELAN_HOME=/opt/elan</code>.</p>

<p>yes, directories will be different. so, I also assume, that all cocalc projects then will have to set <code>ELAN_HOME=/ext/lean/elan</code> ?</p>
