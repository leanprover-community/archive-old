<p>Does anyone have any suggestions for how I might go about studying the axiomatic details of Lean? I'm aware of the main.pdf at <a href="https://github.com/digama0/lean-type-theory/releases" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/digama0/lean-type-theory/releases">https://github.com/digama0/lean-type-theory/releases</a> but.. what is the large arrangement of weird looking symbols in section 2 supposed to mean? Also, the paper says that type checking in Lean is undecidable. Does this mean that Lean might not be able to check some proofs?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> is the author of that pdf. He also happens to be superhuman, so he'll probably be right over... :)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>You will have to be a bit more specific, there are a large number of symbols in section 2. Do you mean the first displayed formula in section 2.1 (after "following grammar:")? That is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form" target="_blank" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form">Backus[-Naur|normal] form</a></p>

<p>Many of the other displayed formulas are typing/inference rules: if all the conditions above the line hold, then the condition below the line holds.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There are indeed proofs in the type theory that are not accepted by the Lean kernel. However, you should note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can always give a bit more information in your proof to help the type-checker along, so that it can verify your proof</li>
<li>This is incredibly rare. I have never encountered this myself, and I don't know of any case in mathlib where we have to give this extra information to Lean (but maybe it has happened once or twice).</li>
</ul>

<p>Is this about things like the pathological example of non-transitivity of definitional equality in the reference manual? Yeah, I have never seen anything like this happening "in real life". Leo is good ;-)</p>

<p>I think it happens quite a lot with <code>acc.rec</code>. I also think this is more or less the only place it comes up in practice.</p>

<p>The main place it shows up in practice is that definitions by well founded recursion should result in definitional equalities in principle, but in practice you usually only get a propositional equality</p>
