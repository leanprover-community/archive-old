<p>Hold the date: I am planning to hold Lean Together 2020 the week of January 6, 2020, a year after the Lean 2019 meeting in Amsterdam. It may be a while before I get going on this in earnest, but I will keep you all posted.</p>

<p>Formal Methods in Mathematics / Lean Together 2020 is official!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Formal Methods in Mathematics / Lean Together 2020</em> will run from Monday, January 6 to Friday, January 10, 2020 at Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The web page is here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/meetings/fomm2020" target="_blank" title="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/meetings/fomm2020">http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/meetings/fomm2020</a></p>
<p>The meeting is a successor to Lean Together 2019.</p>
<p>The first three days will focus on formal methods in pure and applied mathematics, including interactive theorem proving, automated reasoning, verification of symbolic and numeric computation, and general mathematical infrastructure.</p>
<p>The last two days will be devoted to specifically to the Lean Theorem Prover and its core library, mathlib. Users and library developers will have opportunities to present work in progress and discuss plans for the future.</p>
<p>Attendance is free and open to the public, but we ask you to let us know by December 6 if you plan to come.
