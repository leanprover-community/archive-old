<p>Is all I found, and that page literally has nothing on it that I can use as a new person to Lean4.  Just show me how to declare a category, some objects / arrows, and possibly the proof that id for each object X is unique.  That would teach me a lot.</p>

<p>Considering that you are using Lean 4 that tutorial will probably not be <em>that</em> useful since Lean 4 doesn't have all the category theory definitions from mathlib yet. If you are into mathematics and want to do Lean 4 right now you usually have to build up your own theory.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="236489">@Daniel Donnelly</span> there is essentially no mathematics in Lean 4. There is a gigantic mathematics library in Lean 3 called <code>mathlib</code> with lots of category theory, and there's even more category theory in the Liquid Tensor Experiment, a Lean 3 project which builds on <code>mathlib</code>. The computer scientists are writing a program which will translate all of Lean 3's mathematics into Lean 4. It's not ready yet.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="395550">@Henrik Böving</span> okay Henrik, thank you.  Please define Category for me?  I can take it from there, leave some of the parts out so that I can complete if that makes it easier.  I just want to see what the proof looks like for id uniqueness.  Also, is it possible to have side effects to the Lean4 code?  For example can I communicate to another program that is displaying a CD (commutative diagram)?   I know about Widgets, but I'm talking about my own thing which will allow a two-way communication between the diagram editor and Lean4 code/interpreter.<br>
Iow if the user types "f:A \to B" in Lean4, that will be drawn and vise versa.</p>

<p>I can definitely try to define a category but I'm a computer scientist with almost no category theory background so the mathematicians will probably jump at me :P</p>
<p>We can have side effects and what not in Lean 4 sure, Lean 4 is also a full blown programming language on top of being a theorem prover and things like the lean 4 compiler itself, our project management tool, our documentatino tool etc. are all written in pure Lean.</p>

<p>Decided to Keep going with Lean4.  If Mathlib is converted to Lean4 by the time I'm ready great.  If not I'll copy the essentials from the Lean3 mathlib, converting them to Lean4 by hand.  I can only really move as fast as my own project will allow anyway.  But if I can comehow parse Lean4, then when the category library is imported, I could have all that visual content generated automatically.  Thus I can bootstrap off of existing Lean4 efforts.</p>
