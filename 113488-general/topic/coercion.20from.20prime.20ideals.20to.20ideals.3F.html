<p>I don't know what makes a good coercion. We have the following type in <code>algebraic_geometry.prime_spectrum.basic</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">prime_spectrum</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">I</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">ideal</span> <span class="n">R</span> <span class="bp">//</span> <span class="n">I.is_prime</span><span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Unsurprisingly, given a term <code>v : prime_spectrum R</code> one sometimes wants to look at the underlying ideal <code>v.val</code>. I was expecting there to be a coercion, but in fact there is</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">abbreviation</span> <span class="n">as_ideal</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">prime_spectrum</span> <span class="n">R</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">ideal</span> <span class="n">R</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">x.val</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I think <code>abbreviation</code> is the same as <code>[inline, reducible]</code>. I don't really understand <code>inline</code> and am wondering if this is some kind of way to say "I would be happy if the simp normal form is just <code>v.val</code> but my silly users want to call it something". For example this is a <code>simp</code> lemma:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">@[simp]</span> <span class="kd">lemma</span> <span class="n">comap_as_ideal</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">prime_spectrum</span> <span class="n">S</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span>
  <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">comap</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="o">)</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">as_ideal</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="n">ideal.comap</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">y.as_ideal</span> <span class="o">:=</span>
<span class="n">rfl</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Would it be better or worse if there was just a coercion to <code>ideal R</code> and the simp normal form was <code>\u v</code>? It would make statements like this look less clunky.</p>

<p>I think that I introduced <code>as_ideal</code> to make explicit the transition from the "geometrical" picture to the "algebraic" picture. Points of the spectrum can be denoted <code>x</code>, because they are points. But a prime ideal should be <code>P</code> or <code>I</code>, or something.<br>
Of course this is not a Lean reason, but a linguistic(?) one.</p>
<p>At the same time, writing <code>x.as_ideal</code> helps the elaborator, so it's not only a disambiguating flag for the user/reader, but also for Lean. Since we want Lean to also find an instance of <code>is_prime</code> for these ideals, it helps a lot if TC isn't stuck finding a coercion before looking for <code>is_prime</code>.</p>
<p>My guess is that you would end up writing <code>(x : ideal R)</code> explicitly quite often. And then <code>x.as_ideal</code> is actually shorter in the end.</p>

<p>I really like the "geometry v algebra" distinction :-) I was looking at adeles code and there the non-zero primes of a Dedekind domain don't feel like they have any geometry attached to them, although we use the Zariski topology I guess in the sense of "being integral on an open set containing the generic point"</p>
