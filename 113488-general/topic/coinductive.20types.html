<p>Can someone (<span class="user-mention" data-user-email="simon.hudon@gmail.com" data-user-id="110026">@Simon Hudon</span> ?) explain what a coinductive type is and, more specifically, whether a mathematician would ever need them?</p>

<p>As to the comments about them made here and linked to here, this might be another of those "perfect is the enemy of good" situations where we could either have Simon's "does the job to a certain extent", or the observation that one could do this much better if only we could find a Lean C++ hacker that just sat down and wrote a bunch of complicated working code, I would vote for Simon any day of the week.</p>

<p>We don't need a C++ hacker for this one. I hope to implement the next version of (co)inductive types in lean</p>

<p>Mathematically, the theory of coinductive types is very elegantly dual to the theory of inductive types. A simple example of a coinductive type is the type of "possibly infinite lists", which is defined with the same clauses as <code>list</code></p>

<p>This is a type that contains the empty list, finite lists, as well as all infinite lists (a.k.a "streams")</p>

<p>(These are often called <code>llist</code> or "lazy lists" for reasons to come.) The type <code>llist</code> has a <code>cases_on</code>, i.e. you can ask for any <code>llist</code> whether it is nil or a cons of an element and a <code>llist</code>, but there is no <code>rec</code>, because a <code>llist</code> is not well founded</p>

<p>terminal co-algebra of an endofunctor, instead of initial algebra of an endofunctor</p>

<p>if you want to look at them in terms of category theory</p>

<p><code>llist</code> are easy enough without <code>coinductive</code> types but I imagine if you care about (possibly) infinite objects such as trees, it will be hard to study them without coinductive types.</p>
<p>I personally care about them mostly for modelling programs that do not terminate such as operating systems, controllers for pacemakers or any internet protocol</p>

<p>maybe bass-serre theory, aka doing group theory by way of group actions on (infinite) trees</p>

<p>i'm struggling to think up examples from pure math where coinductives would be handy</p>

<p>it's a big world out there though</p>
