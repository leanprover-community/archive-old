<p>Some change to mathlib in the last month or so (I don't know which) caused <code>lean-homotopy-theory</code> to break because Lean now wants to synthesize a <code>setoid</code> instance on the hom types of <code>Top</code> using <code>subtype.setoid</code> and <code>fun_setoid</code> from core, while I want to use a different one. I don't really understand how this is possible; for now I'm working around it by setting an instance priority. But, I am pretty sure that <code>fun_setoid</code> (in <code>init/funext.lean</code>) should not be a global instance, just an instance for the scope of the proof of <code>funext</code>. Maybe that can be changed in 3.5.0?</p>
