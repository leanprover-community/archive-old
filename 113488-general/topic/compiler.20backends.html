<p>Hi, I'm aware that Agda has compiler backends so that we can compile Agda code into Haskell or Javascript (<a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.1.3/tools/compilers.html?highlight=backend#backends">https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.1.3/tools/compilers.html?highlight=backend#backends</a>). I was wondering if this exists in Lean as well. If it isn't, are there any plans to support such a feature? Thanks!</p>

<p>There's nothing like that for Lean 3 (although you can run a WebAssembly version of the Lean 3 interpreter in the browser - see e.g. <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-web-editor">#webeditor</a>). </p>
<p>Lean 4 can be compiled to C, though I don't think the details have been added to <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/">the docs</a> yet.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="123965">@Bryan Gin-ge Chen</span>! I'm not sure the WebAssembly interpreter option is what I would like though.. Do you know if anyone has ever used Lean in order to compile proven code into another language (a bit like Extraction in Coq)? I'm a web developer and would love the ability to write proofs in Lean that compile to Javascript (to run code that has been proven rather than depending only on unit tests).  I guess with Lean 4 at least it will be doable in C?</p>

<p>I don't know if anyone has done so yet, but I think a lot of folks are aiming to do that eventually. See e.g. <a href="#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/lean4-balance-car/near/227876687">this post</a>.</p>
<p>(I'm probably not the right person to ask about this.)</p>
