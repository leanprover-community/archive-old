<p>I'm sure this has been asked before, but how difficult would it be to make <code>library_search</code> a little smarter and a little less frustrating?</p>
<p>For example, the following fails:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">data.nat.basic</span>
<span class="kn">open</span> <span class="n">nat</span>

<span class="kd">example</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">ℕ</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">h</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">m</span> <span class="bp">≠</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">ℕ</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="bp">&lt;</span> <span class="n">m</span> <span class="bp">+</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">:=</span>
<span class="kd">begin</span>
  <span class="n">library_search</span><span class="o">,</span>
<span class="kd">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>because <code>library_search</code> can't fill in <code>h.bot_lt : 0 &lt; m</code> that would then let it find the solution <code>exact add_pos_left h.bot_lt n</code>. </p>
<p>A similar obstacle arises when we have something of the form <code>h : x &lt; y</code> in context but a lemma takes <code>x ≤ y</code>, and <code>library_search</code> can't produce <code>h.le</code> to use the lemma.</p>
<p>So how difficult would it be to get <code>library_search</code> to (virtually) add things like this to the current context before searching?</p>

<p>Library search has a fairly new feature where you can write <code>library_search with h</code> (maybe it's <code>using</code> instead of <code>with</code>? I can't remember). Does this work in your example?</p>

<p>Lines 60-63 of <code>tactic.suggest</code>, in  <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/tactic.suggest.allowed_head_symbols">docs#tactic.suggest.allowed_head_symbols</a>, seem to give special support for ≤ and &lt; on ℕ.  Maybe, simply adding some support for <code>≠ 0</code> could be a simple modification with good results.  The main heuristic would be that the missed conversion <code>n ≠ 0 ↔ 0 &lt; n</code> may be one of the most frustrating failures of <code>library_search</code>.</p>
<p>I have not looked deeper at the tactic, so I'm not really sure if this is a good idea or not.</p>

<p>Every tweak of the algorithm to make one random case work better of course comes with the risk that it makes everything else worse. <code>library_search</code> is already slow when there are heavy imports. But I think there's a more fundamental reason why one shouldn't be doing this.</p>
<p>It's pretty clear what the job of <code>library_search</code> is, and that's to find <em>exact matches</em> against results in the library rather than to do any thinking for itself. That's the formal spec of the tactic. If that spec isn't right for you then this doesn't mean the tactic needs "fixing", it means you're using the wrong tactic. Like Adam I use the workaround he describes: if I'm not sure what the input will be to the function I'm hoping is there, I hedge by adding more stuff to the local context, like h.le or <a href="http://h.ne">h.ne</a>' or whatever.</p>
<p>I was once frustrated by <code>linarith</code> for similar reasons: I couldn't see why it couldn't use <code>h : a &lt; b \and P</code> to deduce <code>a &lt; b</code> until it was spelt out to me that this sort of idea goes under "mission creep" which is not the sort of thing one wants in general from a tactic.</p>
<p>However my memory is that actually some minor tweaks were added to <code>linarith</code> to deal with a very small number of edge cases of this nature, and there is a chance that someone will come up with a minor tweak that solves the problem above. As I say there's then a risk that ten other people want other bells and whistles of this form. And if you want a tactic which applies <em>two</em> results from the library to solve a goal rather than one then this <em>isn't library_search</em>, it's a hammer, which typically takes much longer to run.</p>
<p>The alternative fix is to come up with a convention for how these functions should look in the library. For example we could try and stick to the convention that for hypotheses we always demand <code>ne</code> and for conclusions <code>lt</code>, or that hypotheses and conclusions should always have the same choice, and then the user will know when to add stuff to the local context to maximise the chances that things work. Another possibility is <code>library_search!</code> which starts by adding all these extra bells and whistles to the hypotheses and conclusions before starting, and of course comes with a health warning that because it's now trying to solve 2^n times as many problems it will be 2^n times slower, which might not be what everyone wants but at least they can now avoid it.</p>

<p>I'd definitely vote for a library_search! if not just adding these tweaks to library search, for me the goal of library search is to be maximally useful rather than appear in final proofs, so I don't mind it being a bit more hacky than other things spec-wise personally. The slowness argument is of course something to worry about, but I think changing nat ne 0 to 0 &lt; would save a lot of people frustration in the long run.</p>

<p>Besides the excellent videos that Rob has and that Kevin mentioned, I also learned a lot of meta-programming thanks to the help of Arthur Paulino.  Arthur wrote a preliminary version of the <code>move_add</code> tactic that I wanted to have and this has been incredibly beneficial for me.  And of course, all the follow up discussions that we had about it!</p>
<p>I am not really in a position to prepare a canvas for the tactic, but I try to answer questions in the <code>meta-programming</code> stream, if I think that I can add anything helpful!</p>

<p>As I understand it, the purpose of <code>library_search</code> is "find the lemma that I expect mathlib already knows but whose name I can't remember/work out".  At least, that's very much how I use it and how I imagine a lot of people use it.  I'm not proposing that we change that, just that we make it more capable of doing that job.</p>

<p>While I agree with you in spirit, observe that to convert <code>h : m ≠ 0</code> to <code>h : 0 &lt; m</code> you are using a second lemma from the library.  Thus, either you add a lemma <code>add_ne_zero_left</code> to the library or what you want is a 2-step library search...</p>
<p>I am still in favour of having an option of tweaking library_search to allow looking a little deeper into the library, but I agree with the comment that this should be an optional behaviour, not the standard one.</p>

<p>I appreciate the concern about this change making <code>library_search</code> slower, and if that turns out to be a problem then the modified version should be a variant rather than a replacement.  </p>

<p>I personally found that the speed of library search is mostly affected by the number of imports that I have: depending on how much I am importing, I can either expect it to not timeout, or to timeout.  If it is ever successful, I normally do not care how long it took, though!  <span aria-label="wink" class="emoji emoji-1f609" role="img" title="wink">:wink:</span></p>

<p>Thus, either you add a lemma <code>add_ne_zero_left</code> to the library or [...]</p>

<p>In fact it was just such a situation that prompted this suggestion!  I'd proposed (in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14245">#14245</a>) adding <code>mul_lt_one</code> to <code>algebra/order/ring</code> as a counterpart to <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/mul_le_one">docs#mul_le_one</a> when I found that mathlib apparently didn't know that <code>a &lt; 1 → b &lt; 1 → a*b &lt; 1</code>.  But as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="387244">@Yaël Dillies</span> pointed out, it doesn't make sense "to write <code>2^n</code> version of each lemma where <code>n</code> is the number of times <code>≤</code> appears in it".</p>

<p>Maybe I should point out that I agree with not expanding the library: my suggestion was a hypothetical one with which I disagree!</p>

<p>Oh, I agree!  It's impractical to explicitly list all the things we consider 'obvious'.  That's why I want to broaden the beam of the searchlight instead, so that lemmas like <code>add_pos_left</code> and <code>mul_le_one</code> gain an implicit neighbourhood of equally obvious statements that can also be found.</p>

<p>Can I add a complaint/suggestion regarding <code>suggest</code> to this discussion?<br>
When I use <code>suggest</code>, I frequently observe that when it does not come up with some <code>exact ...</code> suggestion, the list of <code>refine</code>s it presents me with rarely contains anything useful. Say, if the goal is some equality, it seems that I mostly get the same list of stuff that can be used to deduce any kind of equality, but nothing that is specific to the terms occurring on the left and right. I assume that this comes down to the way <code>suggest</code> orders its results. Would it be possible to change that in such a way that more specific proposals appear higher up in the list? I guess the question here is how one can measure the "specificity", which may not be so easy to do...</p>

<p>For the people suggesting to make <code>library_search</code> two-step, consider that assuming no other guidance, finding a one-step proof is O(n) in the size of the library while finding a two-step proof is O(n^2). Now consider how slow <code>library_search</code> is already and how long you would be waiting for the two step version... Brute force search is <em>slow</em>.</p>

<p>It's not quite as bad as that as long as you can give a small enumerated list of glue lemmas like <code>has_lt.lt.ne</code> but I think you will have difficulty avoiding extending the list, so it won't stay small for long</p>

<p>Also, in some cases, there are no local hypotheses that would be useful.</p>
