<p>If anyone else likes/uses <code>bat</code> (<a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/">https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/</a> -- a <code>cat</code> replacement), it was pretty easy to add Lean syntax support to it. The file is here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/Julian/062e5ae6a6a5edfea23f8c89a7ff5d41">https://gist.github.com/Julian/062e5ae6a6a5edfea23f8c89a7ff5d41</a> which was just converted from the vscode-lean file. Stick it in <code>$(bat --config-dir)/syntaxes</code>, run <code>bat cache --build</code> and yeah should work then. Trying to see if a PR to bat would succeed but will see if it meets their inclusion criteria.</p>

<p><code>cat</code> is a program whose function is essentially "print the contents of a file" (technically I'm lying, its real purpose is "conCATenate" a bunch of files together, but everyone uses it essentially for the former). <code>bat</code> is <code>cat</code> but with modernities like "highlight the file you outputted". Basically you use either one when you want to view stuff and aren't sitting inside an editor already (or when say, you are piping outputs from some commands to each other, which seems a bit less likely in this case).</p>
