<p>I just tried to make my first change (in ages) to the core library.</p>
<p>I didn't want to build Lean myself. I had to run <code>elan override set leanprover-community-lean-3.16.5</code>. Is that the intended way to do this?<br>
Am I correct that <code>leanproject</code> will not help for this?<br>
Shall I add a message like this to <code>README</code>?</p>

<p>I'm not an expert, but I think the answer is "yes", "yes", "yes please".</p>

<p>That will work to a certain extent, but I think "go-to-definition" in VS Code will take you to the wrong place. There may be other editor-related things that are broken too.</p>
<p>I don't know a good way to get all of that working without rebuilding Lean, sadly.</p>

<p>Ah, good to know. I think it's still useful to mention this option in the Readme, but I added a warning: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/issues/368">lean#368</a></p>
