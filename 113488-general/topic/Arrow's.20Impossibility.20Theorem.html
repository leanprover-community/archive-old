<p>This summer, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="314430">@Benjamin Davidson</span> and I formalized Arrow's Impossibility Theorem in Lean! We have our Lean project <a href="https://github.com/asouther4/lean_social_choice">on my GitHub</a>. This theorem has been formalized before in Mizar and HOL, but it was a fun project. </p>
<p>Eventually, I'd like to formalize some more Social Choice Theory or Microeconomic Theory in Lean.</p>

<p>Are we going to have a <code>social_choice/</code> folder in mathlib soon?</p>

<p>In the meantime, you may want to set up the github action that keeps bumping mathlib (so that your repository doesn't bitrot).</p>

<p>I would be very happy trying to prepare a <code>social_choice</code> folder...  I wasn't sure if people would be interested in this kind of work on mathlib.</p>

<p>At the very least, I would like to add it as a project and set up that action.</p>

<p>I've heard talks about Arrow's theorem in maths departments, and therefore it's maths, and therefore it's welcome in mathlib?</p>

<p>I doubt we should have a top-level <code>social_choice/</code> folder quite yet. I'm not really sure where to put it. We have combinatorial game theory under <code>set_theory</code>. Perhaps there, or perhaps both of games and social choice should find a new home together.</p>
