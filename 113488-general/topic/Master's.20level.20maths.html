<p>From the <a href="https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/part-iii-guide-courses">Cambridge Part III course list</a>, I was wondering roughly how much of each course has been done in Lean - I believe Category Theory is the highest (around 85% would be my guess), though if we're counting last year's courses then Topics in Set Theory arguably wins from the flypitch project (the course was essentially inner models and forcing for both parts of independence of CH; flypitch obviously does the second but uses forcing instead of inner models for the first, so it's arguable). I'm curious if any other course there comes close to Category Theory on this metric</p>

<p>I guess Lie algebras and algebraic number theory we might make it through the first lecture? :-)</p>

<p>Differential Geometry has quite a bit more done than the first lecture. Maybe something like 15-20%?</p>

<p>Once we have six of these courses done recently we can say that we have trained Lean to know as much as Cambridge would expect from a starting PhD student. They would expect a distinction in Part III which would mean top marks in six of these courses</p>
