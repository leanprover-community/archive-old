<p>I've been looking at "verification down to the metal". Robert Baruch has been designing a CPU in an FPGA and documenting each step with video. One of his videos is "Very Basic Introduction to Formal Verification" which involves formal verification of Verilog (hardware design language) modules. See (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9e7F1XhjhKw" target="_blank" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9e7F1XhjhKw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9e7F1XhjhKw</a>) and also the paper "Veriflog Synthesis and Formal Verification with Yosys" (<a href="http://www.clifford.at/papers/2016/yosys-synth-formal/slides.pdf" target="_blank" title="http://www.clifford.at/papers/2016/yosys-synth-formal/slides.pdf">http://www.clifford.at/papers/2016/yosys-synth-formal/slides.pdf</a>)</p>

<p>Yosys is using things like BDDs or model checking. But a lot of "metal" level "modules" in Verilog are basically either Mealy or Moore state machines. It seems to me that these could be modelled in logic and Lean-like proof machinery could be applied. I'm reading a book on hardware state machines at the moment with an eye towards a potential implementation. That would mean that, for instance, microcode implementations would be fully verifiable at the hardware level.</p>

<p>Lean seems to have an advantage over, say ACL2, in that we have dependent types. It should be possible to declare a 'register type' that knows the size of the register, for example.</p>

<p>Lets play 'assume'. Assume you can prove that a hardware finite state machine (FSM) implements a specification. (Since the implementation is finite state then it seems you can use a SAT solver?). Assume that the specification is Lean's proof checker (so the FSM can check a Lean proof). Assume the state machine(s) is small enough to fit in an Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) (which are huge these days). Then there is a piece of hardware to proof check. Note that the large data center companies (but not ordinary mortals) have access to the new Intel CPU which has a built-in FPGA. So... one could have a hardware "instruction" to check a proof.</p>

<p>The X86 instruction set is beyond my powers to fully specify (I've tried). So trying to validate an implementation is also outside the possible (at least for me). However, an "instruction set" that is specific to proof checking and/or CIC and is well designed (say, as an FSM) then it would be easier to validate.</p>

<p>In addition, data centers used FPGAs all over the place (e.g. they run compression algorithms "on the wire" so the CPU can send/receive at higher bandwidth, they run encryption/decryption "on the wire" so data in flight can't be read or modified). So if code "carried proofs" then you could check, in parallel, that the code is valid.</p>

<p>Modern Intel CPUs contain an FPGA which, in principle, allows you to define your own instructions. So you could "side load" a proof checker.</p>

<p>So you package the proof checker FPGA binfile, the code, the code proof, all "under signed encryption", and then I (well, not <em>I</em> since I don't have access to the new CPUs) can send a "proven GCD" algorithm.</p>

<p>Rather than a Peano succ(succ(succ zero))) computation you'd rather work in normal machine binary (which, as I understand Univalence, says they are "equal"). So Lean can use much higher level (h-level) kinds of reasoning if you can "insert a computer algebra system" into Lean. But you need proven algorithms, presumably "down to the metal".</p>

<p>Yes, this is possible, but lean is not optimally positioned for such an effort. You really want a simplified kernel that doesn't take tens of thousands of lines to write and especially to specify</p>

<p>Comments on your x86 paper.</p>
<p>(1) "information on Linux system calls"... yeah, I had to skip over system calls in the 7000 page paper. System calls were "on the list" to be thought about but our Malware project got cancelled.</p>
<p>(2) "bootstrapping a theorem prover"... I can see where we've crossed paths. I gave up on the x86 path and decided to look at FPGA finite state machines (which a SAT solver can check). </p>
<p>(3) The link I gave above to the Baruch video "Very Basic Introduction to Formal Verification" shows a "prove" mechanism that can be applied to Verilog (hardware spec) code. It includes inductive proofs.</p>

<p>I don't handle very many linux system calls, but you need a few in order to do anything. I have <code>open</code>, <code>read</code>, <code>write</code>, <code>fstat</code> and <code>mmap</code>. In addition to that, you need to axiomatize the program loading behavior, which is surprisingly subtle and context dependent. I think it's not actually possible to guarantee that your program will not run out of memory and access out of bounds before it gets to the first line of the actual program (the ELF <code>_start</code> label)</p>

<p>The linking loader is a self-modifying program. It takes "data" of your program and "data" of libraries, constructs a program, and then "passes execution" to the constructed binary. I'm outlining a paper on "Self Modifying Code" using the linking loader as an example. The idea is to view the linking loader in a "continuation passing style" so the loaded program "returns to the linker.</p>

<p>Not sure how much overlap there is with what you want to do, but I saw a talk once by Adam Chlipala about work his team was doing on verifying hardware/ISA stuff for riscv using coq and a tool they built in coq called Kami. The repo is still pretty active and seems to have examples, it might give you some insight into how people have applied a DTT-based prover to that domain.<br>

<p>Further, since the proof checker basically takes an input and returns either true or false, it is essentially a Binary Decision Diagram (BDD).

<p>I am spending time writing Lean code (working thru TPIL). I just don't have anything worth saying about it. I'm sorry you feel that I'm "trolling". The whole Lean community only seems to care about issues related to mathlib. So, obviously, trying to introduce topics of program proof and "down to the metal" are "off topic". Note that these are active topics in Coq (e.g. Bluespec (Chlipala), Deep Specification (Appel, Pierce, et al), and PhD work on the subject.</p>

<p>It's certainly true that the two provers seem to have attracted two different communities. I think Leo wants to attract more program-proof people with Lean 4, I get the impression that certain design decisions have been made in order to tempt these people over.</p>

<p>mathlib is certainly useful. Its results need to be woven into the inheritance hierarchy of Axiom so individual programs can use the theorems. I'm working on that "weaving" (hence my discussion about parsing and comments about naming conventions and non-unicode). With a focus on proving (math) programs correct it is also vital that proofs have execution semantics (hence my "trolling" on proglib). But since I"m not "contributing" to mathlib development it is clear that any other topic is "off topic". So I don't think Leo will attract any program-proof people, especially from computer algebra who already think proofs are not worth writing.</p>

<p>I speak from experience since "proving programs correct" was one of the main issues that caused a hard fork of the Axiom project. You would think that mathematicians who write algebra would want proofs but apparently not. And mathematicians who write proofs don't want programs.</p>

<p>If you want executable proofs, a system with built-in proof irrelevance does not seem like the best choice, yes. Nothing of that will change in Lean 4.</p>

<p>Why on earth would you write a new kernel for a proof system and not prove it correct? The most trusted part of the trusted system should be proven "down to the metal". Program proofs are central to the whole issue. I'd expect the kernel to be written starting from the judgments with incremental development down to code with each step proven correct. This is computational mathematics, not a game design.</p>

<p>But I am "singing the dual of that argument" in the computer algebra clade. Why on earth would you write a GCD algorithm and not prove it correct, down to the metal? This is computational mathematics, not game design. Somehow computational mathematics has forked into two clades that don't have the same notion of "computational mathematics", although it is probably just me thinking they are related, given the evidence.</p>

<p>Dear Tim, I think it's statements like this that rub some of us the wrong way. You are highly invested in Axiom, and that's fine. But often you write as if there is a logical necessity that Lean and Axiom work together. Or that Lean is designed to be some piece in the big grand toolchain of Axiom. That's just not true.</p>
<p>Working on building interaction between Lean and Axiom is a great idea. Very important. But both systems are also valuable (maybe less, but still) without that interaction.</p>

<p>by that argument, most programs in logic are "basically" a BDD. But inputs are of arbitrary size, so it doesn't work that way!<br>
A kernel for CiC is a complicated thing to write (afaik, the most complicated kind of kernel of trust found in proof assistants). Doing it purely in hardware would be a research problem.</p>
