<p>The <a href="https://exlean.org/what-the-rec-types-dependent-on-terms-lean-eliminators-and-threshold-concepts/">latest exlean post</a> is on the topics I struggled with in <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/">#tpil</a> Chapter 7, viz. motives, minor and major premises. I've done my best to motivate the motive concept in the special case of eliminators on <code>nat</code>. I plan to do a follow-up post looking at other inductive types.</p>
<p>From a pedagogical perspective, I posit that having to treat a particular mathematical object as both <em>having</em> a type and <em>being</em> a type raises similar challenges to those faced by students needing to treat an object simultaneously as being a set and being an element of a set.</p>
