<p>I never use <code>simp</code> really, because I don't understand how it works. Here is a simple example <a href="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/topological.20space.20from.20filter/near/189336789" title="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/topological.20space.20from.20filter/near/189336789">from this thread</a> where I write a simple 7 line tactic mode proof of something which any mathematician would be able to work out in their head.</p>

<p>I am in the middle of a big tactic mode proof so I can't really massage the hypotheses and there's no advantage slipping into term mode.</p>
<p>I observe that (a) this proof is pretty simple; (b) both of the theorems I use from <code>data.set.basic</code> (<code>mem_prod</code> and <code>mem_univ</code>) are tagged <code>@[simp]</code> (and one proof is <code>iff.rfl</code> and the other is <code>trivial</code>); (c) <code>simp * at *</code> doesn't work.</p>
<p>Now what I don't really understand is whether I should even be expecting the simplifier to solve this little logic puzzle, even though the proof looks very much "follow your nose". I don't even know if <code>  simp [hXU, hUV]</code> is meaningful -- it compiles, it doesn't solve the goal. Is this clearly too much for the simplifier? Does the simplifier <em>only</em> prove goals of the form <code>X = Y</code> and only in the situation where subterms of X can be rewritten using simp lemmas until X becomes Y? How should I be solving this goal in fewer than 7 lines? What would a mathlib proof of this look like? This is a big hole in my understanding of how to write mathlib-ready Lean code and it's things like this which are a major contributor to the fact that I've not written more mathlib code.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm barking up the wrong tree and I should just concentrate on building terms as compactly as possible.</p>

<p>Basically, <code>simp</code> has a whole bunch of basic unfolding type rules in its database, and we just apply everything until it stops changing. Now subset is not usually a thing you want to unfold eagerly, however once you have membership there are a whole bunch of simp lemmas that can trigger, to unfold what it means for something to be an element of a complicated set. So here it cleans up all the unions and images and complements, but it hasn't really done anything with the "logic" part - you still have to plumb <code>hXU</code> and <code>hvV</code> together, but it is much more obvious what to do this time</p>

<p>Because these are almost all definitional simplifications, the direct term proof is not much longer in this case. The only real change is you don't have to do that <code>rcases with &lt;a, rfl&gt;</code> dance</p>

<p>Your second proof is almost exactly what I would have used for the mathlib proof of this. (I would have used <code>by</code> and squeezed it on one line because it's basically a short term proof.) I wouldn't use the <code>simp</code> proof because that is slower and the savings in proof size are minimal here</p>
