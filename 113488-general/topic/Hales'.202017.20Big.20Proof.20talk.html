<p>I'm giving a talk today at Inria and in the talk I mention Hales' July 2017 talk at the Big Proof Newton Institute workshop: <a href="https://www.newton.ac.uk/seminar/20170710100011001">https://www.newton.ac.uk/seminar/20170710100011001</a> (I always love the binary link, I think it means 10th July, 10am to 11am, room 1). It's worth investing an hour watching the video, but there's also a link to the slides on that page (although, like any good slide talk, the slides don't make sense by themselves, so you have to watch the video to hear the full story). I watched it again yesterday, to remind me of exactly what he had said and what the state of the art was in 2017. This was the talk that got me interested in Lean (I had never heard of Lean before this talk, but he mentions it in the answer to a question).</p>
<p>p11 of the slides talks about Lessons from the formalisation of Kepler, and one is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Formalizers should be part of the tactical response teams that<br>
routinely intervene in prominent, difficult, unpublished proofs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that the work going on right now in the <a class="stream" data-stream-id="267928" href="/#narrow/stream/267928-condensed-mathematics">#condensed mathematics</a> stream fits this description very well. We are formalising a prominent, difficult, unpublished result of Clausen and Scholze. Hales explicitly mentions the ABC conjecture on the next slide, and I had a discussion with Ivan Fesenko about whether this was feasible recently (I think the difficulty is getting someone to start doing it, I think a top-down formalisation would be one way to make progress). </p>
<p>Slide 32 talks about difficulties with Fabstracts and his attitude is "ignore them for now" -- my understanding of his point here is that we need to look at the greater goal of getting a deliverable to working mathematicians which they can actually understand. Right now we have difficulties with porting mathlib to Lean 4 but the overall goal of getting mathematicians interested in this area in general is greater than this obstruction which is why I am still highly motivated to continue working on mathematics in Lean 3. Someone in private conversations raised the possibility of just porting mathlib by hand, as did Daniel Selsam publically recently, and if this is what we ultimately have to do then I'm sure it will get done. This is going to be a hard problem but I don't think we should let it get in the way.</p>
<p>The final thing I want to flag is that on slide 34 Hales lists a bunch of things which would need to be done just to formalise statements in automorphic representation theory (the branch of number theory that Hales and I work in). I think that at the time that list just looked like a big joke to some people. But the first thing on the list is schemes and the last thing is perfectoid spaces, and we've shown that these things can be done. There is also measure theory, functional analysis, Galois theory, category theory, and we have many of the main definitions in mathlib now. There is also a bunch of stuff which we don't have but which I absolutely have one eye on. I think Hales' point with this slide was that even formalising part of number theory is going to be a huge amount of work, however I am not sure that even he would have envisaged that four years later one could look at his list and say "well a whole bunch of that stuff is either done, or could be done soon".</p>

<p>I tried really hard but I think my comments about Voevodsky could upset some people. I wanted to give the impression that you'll never attract most mathematicians unless you work classically, and basically I'm saying that Voevodsky's constructivism was a big mistake, but i know there are people who worship him</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> are you aware of some typical theorems that don't work in a constructivist setting? (I mean not just painful to prove but known to not be provable)</p>

<p>The issue with this question is that it kind of assumes that the theorems I think about can even be <em>stated</em> in a constructivist setting. In algebraic geometry there is something called a scheme, which is a topological space which locally looks like an affine scheme, and an affine scheme is a topological space which is built from a commutative ring, and without LEM you cannot even prove that the thing you construct from the ring is a topological space, so in some sense an answer to your question is "every theorem about schemes". Here is a link to (something which unfolds to) a 7000 page pdf which has a few theorems about schemes: <a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/">https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/</a> . </p>
<p>The answers that the constructivists give to this is "well you have to reformulate the statements so that they make sense construtively, you need to go and learn the theory of locales". But the moment I start talking about locales, I have lost all of the algebraic geometers in my department, who have never heard of locales. So for me this is not a satisfactory way to proceed.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="235513">@Daniel Fabian</span> Every ring has a maximal ideal. You need choice for that. And it's a fact that's used a number of times in getting commutative algebra of the ground (and hence algebraic geometry and a bunch of number theory)</p>

<p>Also,</p>
<ul>
<li>existence of algebraic closures,</li>
<li>existence of bases of vector spaces,</li>
<li>bipartite iff 2-colourable</li>
</ul>
<p>are further examples of statements that are equivalent (I think) to the Axiom of choice.</p>
<p>On the other hand, "most" algebraic geometry used in practice is for schemes of finite type over ℤ (or ℚ, if you really need a field).  In such cases, my guess is that many statements could be salvaged, but it would probably be hard, non-rewarding work.</p>

<p>Something that took me a while to internalize is the difference between "closed under specialization" and "closed": it is tricky to come up with examples of "reasonable" properties of schemes that are closed under specialization, but not closed.  Such properties would be good challenges for constructivism, I think.</p>

<p>It's maybe worth pointing out that a lot of the strangeness of constructive mathematics comes from absence of LEM rather than choice. A pedestrian example of a theorem that's not valid constructively is "Z is a PID". The problem is that even if you have a decidable subset of Z, you can't tell if it has a non-zero element. Similarly with algebraic closures you can't tell if a polynomial is reducible or irreducible, so splitting fields are already problematic</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="238446">@Anne Baanen</span>, I'm curious to what you extent you think it would be viable for someone who cared about <code>wf_dvd_monoid</code>s  to contribute to refactoring mathlib "from the bottom" to introduce and use constructivist ideas. It would be essential that all the 90% that was still classical could stay essentially as it is (but that's okay, I presume, as PID -&gt; wf_dvd_monoid). Presumably actually the question is about whether you think it would work from a community-interaction point of view.</p>

<p>I think making mathlib, as it stands right now, constructivist behind the scenes would require more than one person. There are quite a few fundamental definitions like <code>finsupp</code>, where treating them constructively was causing too much work for the classical side of things. If some of the technology improved (e.g. we wouldn't need to be so careful with <code>decidable_eq</code>), my hope is that making one definition constructive wouldn't break downstream usages (or at least, not as much as it does right now). In that case, people who care about constructivism don't make life worse for working classically, and I can see one or perhaps a pair of interested contributors making most of mathlib constructive.</p>
<p>One aspect of Lean that I think is an advantage for the constructivists, is that it is still ultimately based on type theory: there is a good notion of data in Lean, and you can point out instances where having access to this data is really useful for the working mathematician.</p>

<p>My arguments against constructivism are: (1) mathematicians in maths departments are brought up to think that constructivists are crazy, so even <em>talking</em> about constructivism involves some risk when it comes to being taken seriously by the mathematicians who matter (2) constructivism makes the library harder for mathematicians to use (c.f. Peter Nelson with his finset woes) (3) constructivists tend to overestimate the importance of constructivism in mathematics, perhaps due to their mathematical tastes not being aligned with what is actually going on in mathematics departments (i.e. a mismatch between what I think the word mathematics "means" and what a constructivist thinks it means).</p>
<p>Anecdotal evidence: when I read the odd order paper I was really turned off by the explanation of how they struggled to do representation theory because they didn't have access to the complex numbers, and simply could not understand what the point of working extra-hard to develop enough of a constructive theory of representation theory to push the arguments through. It was that, and the fact that they also highlighted their idea of defining a group hom from G to H as a partially defined map from some bigger group which contained G and H which just made me think that these people were crazy -- somehow they seemed to be investing a lot of time into issues which I felt should not be there in a proof system. However I really don't know how many other mathematicians would react the way I reacted to that paper. One can contrast that with what Patrick wrote in the perfectoid paper about extending continuous maps defined on dense subsets, and how he had the insight of not working with subsets at all but finding the correct abstraction and thus "beating Bourbaki" (a phrase he would not use himself, I know) where here he is proposing diverging from the standard literature but in a way which makes a lot of sense to me.</p>

<p>Those three points are good ones, and IMO they are sufficient to show that we shouldn't replace mathlib with a purely constructive library. The way I approach constructivism is not as much a project to replace existing mathematics, but instead ask a new question, which I believe is interesting and can lead to useful insights: what do we need to do to make sense of these notions in a constructive/computational setting?  And if the topic is not formalized at all, a classical formalization is much more useful to mathlib than an unfinished constructive formalization.</p>

<p>Sure you can do neither, either, or both (and I think it makes a lot of sense for mathlib to do one but generally not the other), but they're not totally separate issues. There's a lot of synergy between constructive mathematics and formal mathematics. If you want to prove things about your definitions, it helps if the computer can unfold your definitions, and this is easier if your definitions are constructive. I think there's even more synergy in univalent foundations, with its hProps. One of the fundamental obstructions to making mathlib constructive is the proof-irrelevant <code>Prop</code>. On the one hand it's very useful because you get lots of defeqs, on the other hand it's constructively problematic because you can't extract data from it.</p>

<p>I guess they are not totally independent in the sense that if you go both formal and constructive then any natural number you define (like the rank of some elliptic curve over Q or the order of the torsion of some homotopy group) automatically comes with an algorithm to evaluate it. That algorithm probably won't be practical or efficient but there is some psychological comfort in having it.</p>

<p>This case is particularly subtle, because there is actually also an algorithm which should in theory define a computable predicate which cuts out the same subspace, but nobody can prove that it terminates in general (although it always terminated whenever anyone ran it on a concrete elliptic curve).</p>

<p>I don't really buy this argument anymore. "Constructive" means "computable" only in the barest possible sense; if you actually <em>really</em> care about computation, the stuff intuitionistic mathematics gives you is not very useful. Put another way, constructive mathematics tries to be both mathematics and computation, and ends up being a poor approximation of both.

<p>I wouldn't call this a fundamental obstruction. The basic idea is that if you want to extract data from something, put it in <code>Type</code>, otherwise put it in <code>Prop</code>.

<p>There are a few notable exceptions, like <code>finsupp</code>, <code>polynomial</code> and <code>real</code>, where we could be computable and made a conscious decision not to be in order to make the maths smoother, but in all cases there is actually some subtlety to picking an appropriate data representation to be not just computable but also computationally efficient, and the plan is to make computational analogues of these types if and when they get used for some algorithm, so that they can be appropriately tailored to that use-case.</p>

<p>It's not a fundamental obstruction in the sense that you can do constructive reasoning in Lean using <code>trunc</code>.

<p>Note I was only trying to make the weak claim that constructivism and formal mathematics have some synergy, not that constructive mathematics is easier to formalise.

<p>Yeah, I guess that would require a whole lot of work, one would need theorems of the form "if x is in this box with rational endpoints then sin(x) is in that box with rational endpoints, and if we make the first box smaller then the second box gets smaller". I suspect the reason this sort of thing isn't happening is that you can formalise a huge amount of mathematics without ever even caring whether sin(0.1) is positive or negative, and the current driving force in mathlib is somehow people doing other stuff. My guess is that if you were to start prodding the Coq people you'd find a ton of stuff done in this direction.</p>

<p>My guess is that this stuff will happen organically when it's needed. Right now we are romping ahead with theorems of Scholze involving real numbers without ever actually mentioning an explicit real number at all. The only reason we can evaluate pi to even one decimal place was that we decided it would be a fun thing to do on pi day two years ago :-) But I would imagine that there are people here who might well one day need this kind of stuff. Growth of mathlib can often be motivated by people having lofty goals and then focussing on what needs to be done next in order to attain them. Right now I don't see a lofty goal which needs to know whether sin(0.1) is positive or negative, but one I guess could imagine it appearing in the future.</p>

<p>Actually this is impossible, at least with cauchy representation, even if you use efficiently converging cauchy sequences. Given a particular cauchy sequence, you can get an arbitrarily good rational approximation computably, but once you take the quotient, different cauchy sequences will give different approximate results and even though any of them would be "fine" you still can't get a particular answer out.</p>

<p>Yes, that's clear.  But you can't do that with <code>trunc { y : ℚ // abs (x - y) &lt; 0.01 }</code>.  If you define a function on the truncation, you need to prove that it is constant, i.e., it returns the same value for every approximation.

<p>For a simpler example, let's say we want to prove <code>0 &lt; e</code> given an algorithm for <code>e</code>. We can build <code>trunc {q | abs (e - q) &lt; 1}</code>, and if we run it let's say we get <code>2</code>, but it's behind the quotient so we aren't allowed to tell the difference between this and <code>2.5</code> and other numbers that we can't be sure about. Now if we see <code>2</code> we can conclude that any other number in the equivalence class is within 1 of 2 and therefore <code>e</code> is positive. <em>But we don't know that we can only get <code>2</code></em>. We need to know that all values within 1 of 2 have this property, and so we aren't sure that <code>1.5</code> isn't in the equivalence class too, or <code>1</code>, or <code>0.5</code> or <code>0</code> where we're definitely hosed. We want a function that says "yes", "no" or "inconclusive", but the line between "yes" and "inconclusive" is itself fuzzy and basically makes everything "inconclusive"</p>

<p>But my point is that once you take that step, it becomes utterly irrelevant whether the object language has choice or LEM or uses constructive logic or can run proofs, because you are looking <em>at</em> the proofs and can compute whatever you want. Isabelle uses a code generation scheme along these lines and the idea that you need constructive mathematics to be able to run functions from the logic is very foreign to them</p>

<p>Sure. But if your definitions aren't constructive from the beginning, and you want to compute with them, then you need to add lemmas and tactics to compute with them. Whereas if you had a computable model of say the reals from the beginning, then you'd get computable rational approximations for free</p>

<p>I don't understand what you mean by this. If you have a setoid version of the reals, with no quotienting, then you don't even need to wrap your approximations in <code>trunc</code>. But if your reals are equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences (or a recursive HIT like in the HoTT book), can't you still get approximations wrapped in <code>trunc</code>?</p>

<p>Sometimes, the mathematical definition is also good computationally. Maybe <code>list.map</code> is an example.

<p>I think the issue here is that in intensional type theory you can have non-equal real numbers with the same sequence of digits. So when you are talking about "pi" you are really talking about several different objects.</p>

<p>Right, so this idea about different reals with the same digits might be interesting to some foundational people but it is also a massive red flag when it comes to attracting conventional mathematicians to proof assistants (which is my ultimate goal and the motivation behind a lot of my work).

<p>This is not about constructivism. It's true that there are (also in Lean) terms like <code>0 + pi</code> and <code>pi</code> that represent the same real number but are not defeq. I guess in some sense this is due to the fact that they represent different ways of computing pi. But it doesn't matter much to theorem proving, since they're still (propositionally) equal. (You can construct other computable real numbers which are "actually" equal but not provably equal, by Gödel, but that's really beside the point.) The equality <code>0+pi = pi</code> is perfectly constructive. Constructive reals (like the HIT reals) have exactly the same extensionality as you'd expect</p>

<p>But, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="130377">@David Wärn</span>, the equality <code>0+pi = pi</code> won't necessarily be an equality if you leave the reals unquotiented (actually in that particular example it probably is, but there are minor variations that won't be like <code>(2 * pi) / 2</code>).

<p>I claim that you still retain some good computational properties with the quotient. You don't get total computable <code>(=)</code> or <code>(&lt;)</code>, but that's unavoidable and unrelated to the quotient. What you do get is computable <code>trunc</code>-wrapped rational approximations. Given this, writing a tactic to prove inequalities in the reals is trivial. Whereas with mathlib's noncomputable reals, proving <code>sin(e + pi) &lt; -0.4</code>, which should just be a matter of unfolding definitions, is not that easy.</p>

<p>It is possible to implement a prover for <code>sin(e + pi) &lt; -0.4</code> by associating computational methods to <code>sin</code>, <code>e</code>, <code>pi</code> and <code>+</code>. This is essentially the same as what you would need to do with a computable real definition of <code>sin</code>, <code>e</code>, <code>pi</code>, etc except that you would also have to prove equivalence of these computations to the real thing. The computable real approach skips this step, but instead you would need to work with this computational method when proving that <code>sin pi = 0</code> and all those other pure maths facts</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="403138">@Joachim Hauge</span> Mario has now explained what I presume you mean, but for mathematicians there is only one kind of equality. The reason the natural number game makes sense to mathematicians is that I explicitly had to "disable" checking for definitional equality so that mathematicians could not tell the difference between the defeq n+0=n and the theorem 0+n=n. No mathematician would accept the idea that these two kinds of equalities are distinct because we think of mathematics in a very symmetric way and breaking the symmetry is confusing to us. We have one equality to rule them all, namely mathematical equality -- the idea that two things are "the same". We have done well for centuries never going into any further details and these things need to shielded from mathematicians. In NNG n+0=n is proved with <code>rw add_zero</code> and not <code>rfl</code>, and I think this is key to the accessibility for mathematicians. Our instinct is to prove equalities by rewriting rather than unfolding.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7084">#7084</a>, I had to modify the definition of power, so that <code>x ^ 0</code> is not defeq to <code>1</code>, and <code>x ^ n.succ</code> is not defeq to <code>x * x^n</code> any more. This means a lot of proofs broke because they were abusing these definitional equalities, and instead I had to <code>rw [pow_zero]</code> or <code>rw [pow_succ]</code> a lot. I feel this is really for the better, because now the proofs are both more readable and more robust. I came slowly to the conclusion that the only place where defeq really matters is not in userland, but in instanceland where the kernel is checking things and you don't have control on what it is doing.</p>

<p>I think it's a bit unfair to say for mathematicians there is only one kind of equality. As well as the "usual" one, once you receive your licence to use the word "canonical", you can arbitrarily use the <code>=</code> symbol instead of <code>≅</code>. <span aria-label="shrug" class="emoji emoji-1f937" role="img" title="shrug">:shrug:</span></p>

<p>defeq:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The version I heard is that Pauli was lecturing, and he said "this is obvious". A student raises his hand and says "sorry professor, I don't think that is obvious". Pauli stares at the board, back at the students. He thinks for a bit. He starts pacing in front of the class, thinking. He looks back at the board. Eventually he leaves the room, comes back 20 minutes later and says "I've thought about it and yes, it is obvious".</p>

<p>It worries me a little that this ends up adding 500 lines of what are essentially repeated proofs, and makes translating proofs from finsupp to polynomial (an activity which the original problem is partly due to the neglect of) harder. Is there any way we can better handle this with automation?</p>

<p>Thank you for the hard work! I don't think the translation from <code>finsupp</code> to <code>polynomial</code> becomes much harder, since we still have the isomorphism between the two, <code>to_finsupp_iso</code>. (Indeed, I suspect the total amount of changes could have been smaller by using <code>to_finsupp_iso</code> rather than re-proving the existing results, although I have not tried doing so yet.)</p>

<p>In fact, there isn't a lot of proof repetition. Most of the additional code is to set up all the operations on <code>polynomial R</code> by lifting to <code>finsupp</code>, then declaring everything irreducible and registering the basic properties. Once this is done, all proofs are essentially straightforward (and when they're not one-liners we can either lift things to <code>finsupp</code> or use <code>to_finsupp_iso</code>. Another source of addition is that several concepts were only defined for <code>finsupp</code>, but used liberally for polynomials (like <code>erase</code> or <code>frange</code>), so one has to register again the definitions and the basic properties.</p>

<p>The only real pain I encountered is that, after the refactoring, Lean can not at all compute with polynomials (before, it could compute their support), so <code>0.coeff n</code> is not definitionally equal to <code>0</code>, and <code>0.degree</code>, <code>0.nat_degree</code>, <code>0.leading_coeff</code> and so on have to be handled by rewrites instead of <code>rfl</code>. Once the basic few files had been done, this was essentially the only thing that needed fixing all over the library.</p>

<p>This sort of thing is what makes computer scientists shudder, and I think that this is a good reason for trying it, because it is trying to set up a theory in a way which is not at all intuitive for the kind of people who have been setting up theories of polynomials before. Mathematicians prove n+0=n by a rewrite in the natural number game because 0+n=n needs a rewrite and the proof of n+0=n feels like it should be the same because of our internal symmetry</p>
