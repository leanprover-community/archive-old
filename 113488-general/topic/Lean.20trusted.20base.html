<p>Does anyone know if there is a breakdown of the Lean trusted base somewhere? As in, "to trust your Lean code/proofs, you have to accept ...", which is done for Coq in its wiki: <a href="https://github.com/coq/coq/wiki/Presentation#what-do-i-have-to-trust-when-i-see-a-proof-checked-by-coq" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/coq/coq/wiki/Presentation#what-do-i-have-to-trust-when-i-see-a-proof-checked-by-coq">https://github.com/coq/coq/wiki/Presentation#what-do-i-have-to-trust-when-i-see-a-proof-checked-by-coq</a></p>
<p>And is there anything similar to the Coq <code>Print Assumptions &lt;name&gt;.</code> command (<a href="https://coq.inria.fr/refman/proof-engine/vernacular-commands.html#coq:cmd.print-assumptions" target="_blank" title="https://coq.inria.fr/refman/proof-engine/vernacular-commands.html#coq:cmd.print-assumptions">https://coq.inria.fr/refman/proof-engine/vernacular-commands.html#coq:cmd.print-assumptions</a>) in Lean?</p>

<p>I'm sure others are more knowledgeable than me, but for the first question you might be interested in <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span>'s paper on <a href="https://github.com/digama0/lean-type-theory/releases" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/digama0/lean-type-theory/releases">the type theory of Lean</a> and <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/doc/faq.md" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/doc/faq.md">the 2nd to last question of the FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>For the second question, does:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="bp">#</span><span class="kn">print</span> <span class="n">axioms</span> <span class="bp">&lt;</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="bp">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>give you what you want? There's also a <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/blob/caa2076038e2d5a84fd05e9988fbe31d01a7f6ba/tactic/where.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/blob/caa2076038e2d5a84fd05e9988fbe31d01a7f6ba/tactic/where.lean"><code>#where</code> command in mathlib</a> which will give you some more detailed environment info as well.</p>

<p>hmm, assumptions seem to be different from axioms (section variables apparently don't count). But I guess print axioms can give some hint of what has been added.</p>

<p>Section variables are added to the types of any definitions in the section which use them, and so they would be supplied where that definition is used.</p>
