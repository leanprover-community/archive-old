<p>Running <code>lean --make</code> on a file with sorries gives the warnings, but only the first time it's run; is there a switch I can do to make it show the warnings every time?</p>

<p>Seriously, <code>worry</code> might have been a better name for <code>sorry</code>. In Isabelle, where it's from, we also have <code>oops</code>, for "forget this proof attempt". A common mistake is to mix up <code>oops</code> and <code>sorry</code>, ending up with a "lemma" one knows is unprovable. The names are clever and funny, but perhaps too clever for their own good.</p>
