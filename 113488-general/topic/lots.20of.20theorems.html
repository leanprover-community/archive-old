<p>I just came across this very nice list of "fundamental theorems" in many different areas of mathematics:<br>

<p>Oliver says we are welcome to use his list, and he gave me the latex source and gave permission to use it. (He also said he's interested in adding a paragraph about interactive theorem provers in the second half of his article.)</p>

<p>I would suggest that a good presentation would be to only show the "area" and "satz" (Knill's term for the pithy version of the statement), as well as any "author" and "decl" fields we add as links to mathlib. Possibly clicking on an item should unfold the "long" description.</p>
<p>I think with a list like this, where we are not very far along at the moment, it is better to display the entire list, with clear formatting showing which ones are in mathlib and which ones aren't (green and red shaded backgrounds?)</p>

<p>I'm sure you meant this implicitly, but let's make it explicit: stating 90% of them on top of the same unified library of concepts.</p>

<p>This way you know for sure that your dependencies won't change but if you want to refactor a definition, then you have to "republish" all reverse dependencies.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I may be wrong. I think I've spent less than a day looking at Mizar. I disliked the idea of an interpreted with source available only to people who actively used the binary for some time.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span> (sorry for the slow answer,  this got buried). In part, it is because of what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="214703">@Yury G. Kudryashov</span> mentions. But also, there is definitely the issue that there was no curation of the library, no 'gatekeeper' that suggested that things should build on one another. What happens is that different (but equivalent) definitions provide different levels of convenience in different contexts.</p>
<p>But also, there is a definite first-mover effect: Mizar was first at so many things, slowing people down by requiring that they must build a coherent whole we it's unclear that the parts themselves are even possible, is/was simply too high a bar. Only in retrospect can we see that this led into chaos.</p>
<p>Note that Coq has the same problem. They are trying to fix it, but it is difficult.</p>
<p>The problems are well-known: <strong>none</strong> of the current theorem provers have good abstraction facilities. By 'abstraction' here I mean the CS structural version of that, as obviously most of them are happy quantifying over all sorts of stuff that are increasingly 'abstract' from a math POV. This is why we have the bundling/unbundling problems (save for Arend), that so much ink has been written about coerce and transport, that we need to care about 'definitional equality', proof (ir)relevance and so on.</p>
<p>In other words, my opinion is that 'mathematics' as a _unified whole_ does not <strong>yet</strong> exist. And that it will be quite a bit of hard (potentially thankless) work to do so. Because, as others have said, mathematicians do know what they are doing, so it _will_ work.</p>

<p>I'm (a little perversely) quite pleased to see all the struggles with <code>finset</code> and <code>fin</code> in a variety of discussions. In my opinion, this is one of the symptoms of the gap between 'semantic' mathematics and the convenient-on-paper-only short-cuts that are used all the time. </p>
<p>Math uses indexing <strong>a lot</strong>, but because all the theorems you need to be true for dealing with indexing really are true (lots of finite combinatorics at play), there is simply not reason to worry on-paper. But when you try to be precise, wow does it ever become a mess.  Linear Algebra, multivariate polynomials and Multicategories were the two things that brought this into focus for me. (Following the 'Universal Algebra' method of looking at things, eventually you wonder why polynomials seem to inhabit this weird half-semantic, half-syntactic worlds, and so you ask <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/73664/what-is-the-theory-of-polynomials">What is the theory of polynomials</a> and get some super gratifying answers).</p>

<p>I've been playing around with universal algebra in Lean, so I wanted to see how polynomial rings work as universal objects.  Here's a gist: <a href="https://gist.github.com/kmill/546049b5251afdcea9acc7564e7c4fa5">https://gist.github.com/kmill/546049b5251afdcea9acc7564e7c4fa5</a></p>
<p>It uses the formulation that polynomial ring construction is left adjoint to the forgetful functor from pointed commutative rings to commutative rings.  (I didn't prove anything about the structure of the polynomial ring though.)</p>
