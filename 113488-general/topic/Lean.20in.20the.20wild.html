From a first glance, <code>esverify</code> is a Javascript/ECMAScript verifier, and these are some semantics with soundness...</p>

<p>A slightly unusual "Lean in the wild" story:</p>
<p>My partner was out at an aerials (circus stuff) class this evening, talking to someone, who at some point in the conversation asked "Coq or Lean"? (Context: they worked in CS at a research institute here in Canberra, my partner mentioned to them I was interested in automated theorem proving.)</p>

<p>I'm not sure I know enough about schemes to know how to write them down in HOL. You essentially need to relativize everything, i.e. make every definition relative to a set. As far as I understand it, for schemes the biggest advantage of dependent types is that we can ad hoc use the subtype of a open set. This is not possible in HOL.</p>

<p>I understand from the "pitch to journalists" standpoint the 'crisis' story is great, and I fully appreciate that the mathematics literature is crap. Nevertheless, I think when talking to other mathematicians, I'd prefer to emphasise more the "this is fun" / "this isn't quite helpful yet, but if you pitch in someday soon this is going to be an awesome tool" / "if you don't pay attention now you're going to be a dinosaur" arguments.</p>

<p>"A case in point was Andrew Wiles’s proof of Fermat’s last theorem. Only a handful of experts were qualified to evaluate the dense, 200-page proof when it first appeared. "</p>
<p>This is extremely misleading. I'm not even sure that it is true, but even if it is true, within a year or two of the proof appearing there was a very detailed survey article by Darmon, Diamond and Taylor explaining the proof which needed only the kind of background which a graduate student working in this area in algebraic number theory would have, so hundreds and maybe even thousands of people were able to verify the proof within a couple of years of it appearing.</p>

<p>I could give a far harsher talk where I point out various serious mistakes by prestigious people and then point to various recent extremely technical papers by these same people which I know because of insider information did not go through as rigorous a refereeing process as they should have done and then flat out accuse the mathematical community of not having done its job correctly. I am not sure who is the crackpot but recent events in number theory have made me start to firmly believe that it's not me but them. I have thus far refrained from telling such stories in public, but believe you me this is why I am here in the formal proof verification community.</p>

<p>Exactly. There was some discussion about this a while back. The point is that however well we attempt to archive this site, you can't just email the man at Google to say "whenever someone googles for Lean questions, point them here and not at Stack Exchange please". Have you noticed more and more people coming out of the woodwork recently asking random questions? This guy today is asking about modules over a ring -- they have a mathematical background and they are going to SO not here. It's something we need to think about.</p>

<p>Let me return to the main topic of this thread today (Lean papers in ITP). It's probably obvious to computer scientists, but I prefer to write it just in case. As was pointed out to the perfectoid team, forgetting to write that Lean is developed at Microsoft research is not helping to keep Lean funded. So everybody should make sure their papers and slides mention Microsoft research.</p>

<p>Is there any effort to collect and catalog copies of all Lean papers? I would be willing to maintain a bibtex bibliography of papers. One of the key problems of doing "independent research" (as I am) is that papers get locked behind paywalls or lost due to authors leaving the field.</p>

<p>I'd like write access to someplace where people would expect to find a lean bibliography (e.g. a link on the leanprover-community page. Anybody with write access could then add bibliographic entries to their (or other's) papers. A central resource for finding biblio links would make it easier to cite papers. A central repository of copies of the papers would mean that your bibliography could also include a hyperlink.</p>

<p>I note that a discussion began in the comments at <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=11053" target="_blank" title="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=11053">Woit's blog</a> .</p>
<p>I regard this sort of thing (online chat) as not unimportant. I have had over 1000 blog views in the last thee days, just from the fact that he mentioned my blog (the wordpress software tells me that people are clicking on his link) so I think we can assume (if we didn't know already) that Woit's blog is very widely read. If people feel that they have something to say about the issues being discussed there and want to contribute, I can pretty much guarantee that there is an audience reading it.</p>
<p>The reason they're not unimportant is that I am still convinced that the mathematical community is still overwhelmingly completely ignorant of software like Lean, and the more "chat" about it, the better.</p>

<p>I don't like the idea that there would be significant notational differences between  for all and lambda. I think we shouldn't have a completely different syntax for each binder. If we pick <code>.</code>, we should use it for <code>forall</code>, <code>exists</code>, etc</p>

<p>Sigh. I wish there weren't so many meaningless syntax changes. I don't really care what the syntax is, but I like consistency and these changes should be considered in the light of all the people that will have to learn the new syntax. I hope there is at least a rationale posted for all these things at some point</p>

<p>I would actually prefer to use backslash than unicode lambda (but with lambda available as alternate notation). It would be nice if the core syntax didn't use so much unicode, since this makes it difficult for those that don't want to use a lean-approved editor</p>
</blockquote>
<p>there are non-unicode alternatives for lambda, though? Just like coq, I think you can type <code>fun</code> or <code>assume</code> for lambda, and so forth. The implication arrow is the very awesome <code>-&gt;</code>. I mean, you probably know this, so I'm not quite following.</p>

<p>I'm very close to creating a Twitter account only for the purpose of voting here. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span> wouldn't it make more sense to have a GitHub vote? You could created and issue with one message per proposition, and we can use the emoji reactions to vote. I think the period option is really awful. I don't know any language (I mean real language, not programming language) where period is used for anything else than ending a sentence. In what sense does <code>λ x. e</code>ends after <code>x</code>?!? Of course every mathematician would vote for <code>x ↦ e</code> but I'd be happy to keep <code>λ x, e</code> if it is important for CS people.</p>

<p>Period is used in Isabelle. It took me a lot of time to get used to the comma in Lean, and in the end I think I prefer the period because the comma is already used to separate expressions in anonymous constructors. My point is rather that I would like to have two different symbols here, be it <code>. ,</code> or <code>, ;</code> say.</p>

<p>I'd be interested in thoughts about the arrangement of code for this sort of thing.  I think it's desirable to have a static snapshot on the arxiv and a maintained repository on github.  Certainly some of the code on my github repository could move into mathlib.  We could have a policy and/or aspiration that all code supporting a published paper should move into mathlib.  Or we could have a separate repository for that purpose, but still under leanprover-community and set up with travis so we can maintain compatibility with mathlib.</p>

<p>It's a little ambitious to expect everybody to keep their code up to date. An arxiv submission should contain git hashes of any dependent packages. Probably also a specific Lean version number too, in order to ensure reproducibility, maybe using Elan? Then even if the paper is read years later the code should still work without squiggly lines.</p>

<p>I think you're probably more concerned than I am :-) I think that when I was younger I would have been running around panicking, but now I understand the internet much better and it seems to me that most Lean stuff on the internet is sane, and then this one piece is a bit more extreme but it will just disappear into the general noise. I think much more interesting is Frank Calegari's claim that some humans completely understand the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, so I wrote a blog post about that instead.

<p>I guess my interest in proof checking stems from a very different thing, where we have a general proof that something is (unprovable? -- i dont want to say false), but in special cases can be proven true, the general cases tend to throw shade on the special case, and the special case tends to require a lot of setup... It's probably best if I just give an example...</p>
<p>like the idea that nand has no inverse and loses information, but in the case where nand is the partial application of a reversible universal logic gate like a fredkin gate, or a toffoli gate the complete gate has an inverse.  I like proof checkers for their ability to convey all these special assumptions, when trying to convey a counterintuitive truth ... This is somewhat the dual of Kevin's what if its false when we think it true I guess.</p>

<p>This comment from Hacker News is quite a marvel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IMO the final paper had too much technical jargon which was convoluting some simple concepts.</p>
<p>This is symptomatic of IMHO the biggest single problem with the world of mathematics today. This discipline should be about developing ideas based on rigorous foundations and logic, which is a useful and important purpose. Once you have understood those ideas, even "advanced" results often seem quite simple and intuitive, and we can take that understanding and apply it to other work if helps us to make useful progress. However, the amount of needlessly obscure terminology, poor notation and just plain bad writing in formal papers make the whole field absurdly inaccessible, even to many who might have no trouble understanding the underlying concepts and important results.</p>
<p>Just imagine what would happen if we tried to write engineering specs or software the way postgraduate mathematics research is done. We'd be trying to debug source code where every identifier was a single character, taken from one of three or four different alphabets, with several of them looking similar enough to mistake one for another, with a bunch of combining accent modifiers on top that were used to fundamentally change the semantics of the program, interspersed with comments by someone who needs a remedial class in basic writing skills, full of technical terminology that is defined in terms of other technical terminology from other software packages, except that sometimes the meaning is subtly different in this context but that isn't noted anywhere on the screen at the time, resulting in needing to spend half an hour doing a depth-first-search of all the definitions only to find that a function whose only identifier is the name of the developer who wrote the second version (because the first person to work on it already has another function bearing their name) is actually equivalent to what a programmer would write as</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>const DAYS_IN_WEEK := 7
</pre></div>


<p>I write this as someone who studied mathematics to a high level and has touched on the field many times since in connection with heavily mathematical software development. It's the worst sort of closed-world gate-keeping, and we could do so much better, but sadly inertia and vested interests are not our friends in this matter.</p>

<p>Mathematica won in the computer algebra field for a simple reason. It had the best documentation. The learning curve for any computer algebra system is quite steep and all of the other systems relied on "learn by trial".</p>
<p>Now look at Lean. Take, for example, group.lean. It is a wall of text. Finding a theorem relies on odd names like mul_eq_of_eq_inv_mul. The whole of the "communication" with people, such as it is, is contained in that name. Programmers made the mistake of this "pile of sane" (POS) approach, witness the "src", "inc", "tst", and (usually empty) "doc" directories with "semantic naming" like parser.c, <a href="http://SMTFuns.pl" target="_blank" title="http://SMTFuns.pl">SMTFuns.pl</a>, or <a href="http://catsim.ml" target="_blank" title="http://catsim.ml">catsim.ml</a>.</p>
<p>Suppose, instead, there was a group theory textbook in latex. The textbook explains the ideas in natural language. It contains all of the lemmas in group.lean, each  one with a paragraph or so of explanation. The lemmas are in named "chunks", basically a verbatim block with a name. Lemmas should only be accepted when they contain a paragraph or section in the group theory volume.</p>
<p>Now you have a book, with a table of contents, a table of equations, chapters, sections, paragraphs, an index, and a bibliography, all hyperlinked and searchable. Since each lemma is in a named verbatim chunk you can extract any or all lemmas automatically, letting the compiler do it. You can find relevant lemmas by looking in the table of contents or the index.</p>
<p>Code to extract a named chunk is 170 lines of C. Axiom already uses this technology.</p>
<p>The idea is called "literate programming" (Knuth). You write for people, and incidently, write for the machine. And, as a benefit, you get a book to publish, which counts on your resume rather than a file of code that doesn't.</p>

<p>I'm suggesting that the "library" format for lean is books, not files.

<p>One clear problem is that probably 5% to at most 10% (just a guess, an authority can jump in if they please) of the lemmas in <code>mathlib</code> are actually even stated in a mathematics book. At the very least, in mathlib proofs of important and hard, "real", propositions and theorems are often chopped up in order to remain manageable. I think just the act of <em>stating</em> many of the broken-up pieces as they are phrased in lean would be totally unbearable to read in a mathematics book. Imagine, for example, such a direct translation of <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/group_theory/sylow.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/group_theory/sylow.lean">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/group_theory/sylow.lean</a><br>

<p>but even if it does grow to millions, most of those lemmas wouldn't benefit much from extensive documentation. <br>
i suppose the normal workflow is the following: you encounter a technical issue in one of your proofs that is intuitively obvious but would be bothersome to prove. you use library_search or some other lemma search tool to resolve the technicality, and then go on with your proof.<br>
there's really not much beyond the lemma type that matters.</p>

For instance <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/geometry/manifold/manifold.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/geometry/manifold/manifold.lean">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/geometry/manifold/manifold.lean</a>, that I wrote recently and for which the more than 100 comments in the PRs made me vastly improve the documentation. Does it correspond to what you are looking for, or how would you envision things for better documentation?</p>

<p>I'm looking at several systems (COQ, AGDA, IDRIS, HOL, ISABELLE). HOL88 is interesting because it is implemented in Common Lisp and I can embed it in Axiom directly (which is also Common Lisp). Lean is interesting in particular due to Jeremy Avigad. I used it a bit and now I'm trying to communicate between it and the compiler. Axiom is typed everywhere, at every level, and is dependently typed so I need a robust system.</p>

<p>FWIW I figure most people don't use ITPs because being formal is a chore. Nobody cares about Bourbaki, and nobody cares about convincing a computer they are correct. In that sense they are a solution in search of a problem. I think they will take off once we true believers formalize enough math and develop enough useful tactics that the software starts being a net gain in productivity as opposed to a 10x reduction.</p>

<p>Andrew, I'm not sure how far tactics can carry you toward that goal. The undecidability issue is an issue. Axiom uses heuristics at runtime to resolve type questions that can't be computed at compile time. I expect to run into the same issue once I try to prove some of Axiom's algorithms correct. Also, tactics have to somehow be related to the specification language of the algorithms and I'm not sure what to think about that connection yet. It is still an "open research question" for me.</p>

<p>The Axiom Sane project (Sane is a synonum for rational, coherent, judicial, and sound) is trying to build a bridge between these two fields, merging computer algebra and theorem proving machinery.</p>

<p>I see that Axiom wants to call Lean under the hood. Is it feasible that I could call Axiom from Lean and get a proof certificate for things that a CAS can do? For example, I would love to call out to a cylindrical alg decomp algorithm, or matrix decomposer alg, or symbolic integrator.</p>

<p>I guess in these cases it's difficult since not only the result needs to be returned, but also the sequence of transformations that lead up to it</p>

<p>Andrew, that's exactly the goal of the Axiom Sane project. Axiom should be a trusted oracle for computing algorithms. Libraries like complex numbers, computing primes, doing CAD, etc. are easy in Axiom but providing a trusted algorithm and a proof certificate is the center of the research question. The oracle response should provide the answer and a proof that the checker can check</p>

<p>I can't imagine trying to encode the Risch integration algorithm in Lean. It requires too much algorithmic machinery, most of it at the PhD thesis level. But it already exists in Axiom.</p>

<p>The idea of "encoding all of mathematics" doesn't seem to mention the computer algebra field. Certain algorithms (e.g. Buchberger's algorithm) seem to have been proven but the whole subject of Infinite Group Theory, which is mostly non-terminating procedures, doesn't seem to fit into the proof systems easily.</p>

<p>I think that Andrew's suggestion is the more profitable angle here. Rather than attempt to have lean be a component of axiom, see if you can modify axiom to produce certificates of its results that can then be checked in a theorem prover like lean</p>

<p>The problem with treating Axiom as a black box is that you don't trust it, and the very purpose of the project seems to be to make it more trustworthy. The only way you can achieve that is either by whiteboxing the algorithm and proving it correct, or by having the algorithm validate any outputs it gives by producing proofs alongside.</p>

<p>If you want ITP mathematicians you have to grow them. So you need courses. You need documentation. You need degrees which recognize programs as well as papers and books. Current mathematicians are successfully set in their ways and they know where credit lies.</p>

<p>I am taking a risk in my job by not producing the standard research papers which I used to produce. My justification for this is that I am attempting to put courses together. But I won't be able to change our UG maths degree, other than by adding a pure Lean course to it (which I no doubt will try to do at some point). It will still just be one of many.</p>

<p>We didn't prove the snake lemma in the Lean HoTT library. We actually needed very little homological algebra for our project, much less than we initially suspected. I think we proved some other lemmas, like the four and/or five lemma, but never actually used it.<br>

<p>Edit: I think I misunderstood the question, apologies. Here is what i originally wrote which doesn't  answer your questions. If you click on the link you'll see lean is already on that list. Maybe there are a some more things that have more recently appeared in mathlib that we haven't updated Freek about (mean value theorem <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="214703">@Yury G. Kudryashov</span> ?) but more-or-less the answer is we have a fair number of these goals formalized (including at least one which is present in no other system) but less than the more mature systems.</p>

<p>To answer the questions in the post:<br>
1) which of these can make use of work done in which other ones?<br>
There are two ways in which systems can make use of work in others, either via an automated conversion/ or embedding of the logic of one into the other, for this you might be interested in <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> 's work embedding some metamath0 proofs inside of lean, the other way is that those with similar logic can also draw inspiration / replicate ideas from one in another system more easily. For lean this would likely be coq, where a lot of work (tactics especially) in lean have learned from prior work done in coq, rather than reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p>2) which of these would be the easiest for mathematicians with some programming experience to learn to use to create machine-verifiable proofs?<br>
Lean of course ;). More seriously that's  a very difficult question to answer as the answer depends on personal preference, how much experience the user has with different types of programming languages. </p>
<p>3) which of these have a good translator that turns a machine-readable proof into something a human reader might gain insight from?<br>
None of them? ISABELLE/NAPROCHE  and forthel are projects that go in that direction, but is more aimed at writing a human readable proof that a machine can read, rather than translation. Peter Koepke and Tom Hales have thought about how this might work in lean but I'm not aware of any publications (yet).</p>

<p>I took this to mean untrained human, but for lean at least it completely depends on the style, level of comments and whether you have an interactive viewer open, if you show me a random term mode proof in mathlib without lean open what I'm going to get from it is what lemmas are used probably, wether induction is used or not, and at the end of the day I'll be reconstructing the proof "flow" in my head, I don't know what level of insight that is, compared to say a normal proof in a book or paper. I feel like this question is really getting at a system where I can show the output to a random mathematician and they will not think it looks odd (a la Ganesalingam-Gowers).</p>

<p><code>tidy</code> originated in a (completely unsuccessful) attempt to imitate what they did. Ed Ayers (who is Gowers' student) has been pursuing this properly.</p>

<p>For the record: the "completely unsuccessful" is a very modest description with a lot of irony. <code>tidy</code> is probably one of the best hidden tactics in mathlib. You don't see it, but it get's called a lot. And that's just the way it was meant to be.</p>

<p>I think it's fair to say that while it is a useful and powerful tactic, it does not really act like the Ganesalingam-Gowers prover. It's still not clear to me whether this is a failing of <code>tidy</code> or the GG prover</p>

<p>This is a bit off-topic, but this title got me thinking about lean in the wild more literally. To what extent do you think theorem provers will be present in everyday life? </p>
<p>For example, I have type 1 diabetes, and as pumps and sensors get more automated we currently can't do much more than trust that their software won't go wrong and potentially do terrible things to us. Of course there is a lot of testing that is done to prevent that, but being able to prove things about these devices seems nice to me.</p>
<p>Another thing would be voting systems, of course. And more or the sci-fi side, I wonder what would it be like to have formalized laws and jurisdictions, and lawyers who prove theorems and debate about hypothesis (but of course this kind of thing would certainly come with its own problems)...</p>

<p>One area where formalization of laws could be useful is in hours of service regulations (i.e. how long truck drivers can work). The rules can get quite elaborate, especially in the US, and in fact formalization is already underway with the move to electronic logbooks.</p>

<p>There were some debates on how one should interpret the "2 terms" rule in Russian Constitution. Putin interpreted the phrase as "no 3 terms in a row" while others did argue that it should be interpreted as "one may be a President either for 1 term in a lifetime, or for 2 terms in a row". (Later he just changed the Constitution).</p>
<p>And there was another debate a few years before Putin. The law says that a president suggest a candidate for the position of the prime minister, and the parliament votes to accept or deny the candidate. If the parliament denies 3 candidates, then elections must be held immediately. The question was: may the president suggest the same person 3 times in a row or he has to suggest 3 different candidates?</p>

<p>Disclaimer: these two paragraph were meant to be examples of difficulties with interpreting laws written in natural language. Though I have my opinion about the political situation in Russia, I would prefer to avoid discussing it here because I assume that people should be welcome to contribute to <code>mathlib</code> regardless of their political views (and thus it's better not to discuss these views unless such a discussion is required to resolve something withing the community).</p>

<p>Students at Imperial, working with preliminary versions of the definition, have proved that Gamma (Spec(R))=R and that Gamma and Spec are adjoint functors between rings and locally ringed spaces. All of this is yet to hit mathlib. We've never done products but we have tensor products so there's a clear path to it.</p>

<p>We should make a roadmap for other things about schemes. I'm working on several things still, but would prefer if other people who actually knew algebraic geometry did it. :-) Proving that sheafification is an adjunction is the most immediate need, I think, so that opens up lots of the basic categorical properties of <code>Scheme</code>.</p>

<p>In terms of a roadmap for a roadmap, we should do some thorough crosslinking of mathlib and the Stacks project. Ideally we could even produce visualisations of the Stacks tag network, coloured according to what's in mathlib.</p>

<p>I am not sure whether this counts as a roadmap, but two results that I use quite frequently are </p>
<ol>
<li>the Miracle Flatness Lemma (<a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00R4">https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00R4</a>)</li>

<p>Henrik Lenstra always preferred bold. He told me that bold was the notation in the books originally when notation began to be standardised, and then blackboard bold was invented for blackboards, so the correct notation when working in a non-blackboard format (e.g. print)  is bold.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Henrik Lenstra always preferred bold. He told me that bold was the notation in the books originally when notation began to be standardised, and then blackboard bold was invented for blackboards, so the correct notation when working in a non-blackboard format (e.g. print)  is bold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a very strong opinion on this subject. It is one of the few places where I dare to disagree with Lenstra (and Serre!).</p>
<p>Typography is the art of making things invisible. If you notice the design of some piece of text, it is distracting you from the content. If something stands out, it better be important. For that reason we <em>emphasize</em> the word that is being defined in a certain definition. For that reason, it is okay to print the word <strong>Theorem 2.1</strong> in bold when you state it (but not when you refer to it, probably).<br>
In my thesis I went so far as to not have <em>any</em> bold text anywhere. But I think that judicious use of bold text is fine. If a user is searching for a theorem statement, then it can help if the eye is attracted to <strong>Theorem 2.1</strong>.</p>
<p>However, the eye need not be attracted to the symbol <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{N}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68611em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbf">N</span></span></span></span></span>. Of course it is a very important notion in mathematics. But probably not for the topic/page that I'm writing right now. I therefore think that the blackboard bold letters (<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="double-struck">N</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi mathvariant="double-struck">Q</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{N}, \mathbb{Q}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.88333em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">N</span></span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">Q</span></span></span></span></span>, etc) strike an excellent balance: they are elegant and unintrusive.</p>

<p>If someone would like to figure out what shorter names for everything should be, feel free to rename things (you'll probably want to do some renaming in inner product code alongside that for geometry). Likewise for shorter statements using <code>^ 2</code> (which might indicate a few lemmas elsewhere that could do with <code>^ 2</code> variants, but I expect the geometry lemmas themselves should only be stated with one of <code>^ 2</code> or <code>*</code>, not in both variants).</p>

<p>Indeed, if you wanted to compare a synthetic proof in Euclid vs a synthetic proof in Lean. What we can take OP to be, though, is a quantitative comparison of a synthetic proof with a fully unfolded one (modulo <code>tactic</code> modules and so on).

<p>I've said this elsewhere, but I think that for "named" theorems we should use the names, modified as appropriate to indicate syntactic differences when there are multiple versions of a theorem. The symbol-based name is only useful if that's the main identifying feature of the theorem, which makes it good for things like group lemmas but not so good for advanced maths theorems</p>

<p>That is, we should ask the question "what is the most likely way someone is going to attempt to find this theorem" and name the theorem after the identifying features in the head of that hypothetical someone</p>

<p>I'm glad they clarified.  I also find it funny the article is called "Hacker-Proof Code Confirmed", and has the quote “We are much more clear about what we can and cannot do.”</p>
<p>Formal methods can show code satisfies specific properties, but it's pretty much impossible to formalize what it means for a complex system to be "hacker proof".</p>

<p>FWIW I tried out MMJ2 but gave up after running into various text editing bugs. So I think something fairly minimal that runs in VS Code would get me interested enough to experiment more with metamath.

<p>mmj2 uses a "collaborative editing" model, where you type some stuff, press a button and the computer edits the same text you are writing to insert more information. This makes it somewhat synchronous by design; after you press the button you need to wait for the result or else your input will be clobbered. Syntax highlighting works at an even higher frequency; it basically needs to run any time you type a character or even scroll around. Java text boxes weren't really designed to support that, and the result is super janky as Brian observed</p>

<p>One question: is Metamath Zero sufficiently different from classical Metamath that it can't be pitched as the next great Metamath verifier?</p>
<p>One of my biggest "problems" with metamath is I think readability. Lean is pretty unique, in the sense that you can give a pseudorandom theorem statement to a mathematician who doesn't know Lean, and then they can understand the statement. (The definition of a group is completely understandable, infinitude of primes is very readable.) With metamath, I know that you shouldn't try to read the source code, but even the dedicated website that renders the readable form is not really readable to me.<br>
So I guess that my point is: readability (of at least one rendered form of the library) is <em>extremely</em> important. I can now barely read coq, but I don't like their ascii-art syntax either. Lean really hit a sweet spot here, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Just my two lay cents.</p>

<p>It's a different formal system, which means that none of the accumulated metamath verifiers over the years will verify .mm0 files. So it's a question of whether to migrate to the new system, which is kind of an all or nothing proposition. That thread is concerned with how to integrate with the existing language, so that it can be used to help develop <a href="http://set.mm">set.mm</a>, for example.</p>

<p>The state of the art of metamath rendering right now is the "structured view" that you can see in examples like <a href="http://metamath.tirix.org/fsumf1o.html">http://metamath.tirix.org/fsumf1o.html</a> . (There is a "structured view" button in the top right of any metamath web page, but note that these files are hosted on an external website so sometimes the pages are missing.) Some of the plans I discuss in the thread have the possibility to improve rendering by associating notation to constructs in a tree-structured way, something that metamath.exe has historically not been able to do, limiting it to sequences of GIF images that you usually see (I think unicode is the new default though).</p>
<p>The other reason you might find metamath web pages unreadable is the high density of symbols due to the presentation style that puts every step on a separate line. I'm sure if you presented lean proofs like this it would also be quite dense (generally single lean steps take up a whole page for the context, so the full thing would be huge). I can imagine a variety of tool assisted ways to make this more focused. Perhaps we can do something like the lean tactic view, where you see one step at a time and can scroll around; I'm not sure how effective this would be.</p>

<p>But MM0 can verify all of <code>set.mm</code>, and it's fast. Is the difference between <code>set.mm</code> and <code>set.mm0</code> so big that it would be a big hurdle for the metamath community to jump over? Apparently yes. I'm too much of an outsider to really help here.<br>
But mm0 has a couple of major benefits (like mmc, etc) that you would loose if you would start building a new version of mm, right?</p>

<p>Aah, I just see that you answered this in the google groups thread:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One issue is that MM1 is a proof assistant for MM0, it doesn't currently support MM. One way I would like to support this is to be able to "import "<a href="http://foo.mm">foo.mm</a>";" in an MM1 file, which will convert the MM theorems into MM1 and import them into the current file; this will make it easy to build on <a href="http://set.mm">set.mm</a> from within an MM0 development, but it doesn't "give back" to the MM database, it is a one way conversion (at least so far), and even if the reverse conversion were added it would probably not be the inverse map, resulting in ugly proofs after round-tripping.</p>

<p>I joined this chat after watching that video by quanta magazine. I've always felt a need for something like Library of Mathematics to help me learn and fill the gaps in my knowledge. And watching Kevin in that video got me real excited about Lean, and I went through whatever links related to lean I could find haha</p>

<p>Hello <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> , </p>
<p>thanks. <br>
There may be a misunderstanding here, it's not really about the current state of pure maths, but about the current state of peer review. Of course, the problem is that both are intertwined in subtle ways.</p>

<p>Rather than focusing on the benefits of higher assurance from formalized computer mathematics, I wonder if the main benefit will be enabling collaboration on a larger and more rapid scale. <br>
As a computer scientist, it is impressive the way the folks in the mathematics community are able to remotely collaborate on the proof process for mathlib and the condensed mathematics work.  Is Lean facilitating that collaboration or is that more common in mathematics than computer science?</p>

<p>In collaborating on research we mostly work on our own or in groups of at most 3. But mathlib and the condensed stuff are of a different nature -- this is not people working together to make new mathematics, this is people translating old mathematics, and so there is a huge group of people who knows the maths well and it's easy to work on your own thing and then find that other people are using it. The condensed stuff is basically being led by Johan Commelin and he constantly makes it clear what needs doing, and people find their own sub-projects (e.g. I messaged him this morning to say "I have a few hours today, what shall I do?" and he pointed me to a lean file and a page of a maths pdf and I just got on with it).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> That makes sense.  I don't know of corresponding analogs in computer science/software engineering, but I can see how that enables a more distributed and larger effort.   For software, there is no group I know of out to formalize something like Windows 95.</p>
<p>A slightly different angle on selling this to mathematicians would be if formalization accelerated acceptance of an idea.  e.g., if the condensed mathematics formalization work convinced people the work was good and well-founded faster than traditional peer review.  I suspect proof assistants have a ways to go before that pans out.  That's how I'd eventually like to be able to convince people of the value of formal methods in software -- a client/end-user can trust a new system or software because we have rigorous evidence that it works as intended even though the traditional social processes (e.g, existing system developers) are trying to convince that person to be skeptical.</p>

<p>Maybe something like Jepsen (<a href="https://aphyr.com/tags/Jepsen">https://aphyr.com/tags/Jepsen</a>) is an analog in computer science? Someone (in this case one person really, aphyr), a piece of software, trying to increase the correctness of distributed system software, but each individual software component driven by its own small groups, and generally being pre-existing systems?</p>

<p>I hadn't heard of Jepson, but that seems relevant.  It seems like somebody doing a more rigorous analysis than most pen testing or fuzzing.  I think there are a lot of small analogues like that in computer science where a person or group (like Google Project Zero).   I guess the Linux kernel and Debian are also analogues given the huge number of people from different backgrounds collaborating to make a reliable system that gets adoption even though they use tests and other software engineering practices rather than formalization.</p>

<p>It's probably also worth saying that I don't really know of anything  else going on in mathematics which is like this whole mathlib adventure. We have these polymath projects, an idea of collaborative mathematics set up by Gowers which worked very well, and of course we have mathoverflow, but the mathlib project is not really like either of these things.</p>

The main theorems proved are the matroid intersection theorem (<code>matroid/intersection-union/matroid_inter.lean</code>) and Kung's lemma ( <code>matroid/uniform_minor/kung.lean</code>).

<p>Thanks - I will look into cleaning the basic stuff up and making it PR-ready. </p>
<p>One concern I have is with stuff in the project that is just kinda kooky. For instance, I use a function called <code>size</code> rather than <code>finset.card</code> (or really, <code>fincard</code>, which I'm waiting to find its way in). The difference is that <code>size</code> is <code>int</code>-valued rather than <code>nat</code>-valued, and the reason for this choice is because subtracting sizes from eachother and other <code>int</code>-valued expressions happens all the time, and I never want to worry about <code>nat</code> subtraction. The alternative would involve a bunch of fussy bookkeeping before each invocation of <code>linarith</code>. </p>
<p>And <code>size</code> gets used from the very beginning to do everything. I'm very comfortable with this decision for my project, but I don't imagine it would suit mathlib very well to have a separate API simply for the coercion of <code>finset.card</code> or <code>fincard</code> to <code>int</code>. Is there a workable solution to this?</p>

<p>Part of the problem is stupid things I said in 2019 when I had no idea about the CS aspects of things and could not explain properly why lean was a better fit for Scholze mathematics -- at the time it was simply obvious to me and I had no idea why because i never used Coq, I had just seen what they had achieved and felt that lean could easily do something completely different. I really tried to apologise for my actions in my INRIA talk last year. It is not my intent to create enemies of any kind. I am not horrible, I am just quite autistic and occasionally say or do stupid things without thinking about the consequences of my actions. I do not bear a grudge against anyone who said anything about me in the Coq community. I think that what is happening now in Lean now with the Scholze challenge speaks far louder than "man in stupid trousers says all maths is wrong" or "ignorant non-CS person says Lean is better than Coq". I am much better able to express myself now and my views are far more refined and educated.</p>

<p>I noticed yesterday that the Nature article "Mathematicians welcome computer-assisted proof in 'grand unification' theory." appears to be missing.  I've tried the link above and the DOI link <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-01627-2">https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-021-01627-2</a> .  It says "Server Error", so hopefully it is just that.  I've also tried to search on the Nature site.  It doesn't show up in all searches (for example searching by the Author), but it show up when searching for the title.  In that case, same server error.  (And to be clear, other articles work fine on nature.). Google can still find the <a href="https://media.nature.com/original/magazine-assets/d41586-021-01627-2/d41586-021-01627-2.pdf">pdf of the original published version</a>.  Anyway, if someone knows the author (or a Nature editor), they might want to point this out.</p>

<p>I repeatedly told him that the proof-at-large was a) really joint with Dustin and b) really occupied us for a year. (Well, it was kind of done after that week, but writing it up only occured towards the end of the year, and certainly my mind wasn't at rest until it was written.) But it's also true that a part of the proof, and essentially the one you've now formalized (ie Lecture 9) is something where I've spent a week as described in the article.

<p>He does quote <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> as someone who "gets it", so maybe he agrees that the folks working on formalization now are enjoying it, but worries that it will not stay that way? In any case, I agree that it's a weird litmus test. I don't think that "mechanized mathematicians" who work in the area for a living (or simply because they want to guarantee correctness) instead of enjoyment are more likely to ruin the fun for regular mathematicians, which is the only thing I can think of as to why he'd use this as the litmus test for a good colleague.</p>
<p>A lot of it seems to be directed at ATP, but the other criticism of ITP in that post that I can see is that formalization may result in mainstream mathematics that is easy to understand by computers and not easy to understand by humans, and that less rigid notions of proof may end up being rejected outright:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would mathematicians who refuse to adapt — for example, because they find the rigidity of the system an obstacle to expressing their ideas — be forced to resort to samizdat, or even blogs, to get their work published?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think one of the goals of ITP is to close this gap, so that less rigid notions of proof can still be used for formalization. Hence whether this concern is justified depends on whether ITP manages to close the gap and the success of ITP in mainstream mathematics.</p>

<p>From many mathematician's viewpoints, mathlib looks like a library where there are theorems stated and the statements are pretty easy to understand, and then there are the proofs which look incomprehensible. So it is nothing like a marked improvement in readability. Of course this can be fixed by learning the language but this is not something that one would expect the mathematician of 2021 to do in general -- they already learnt how to decipher the heiroglyphics in maths papers and they don't want to learn a completely new way of doing it.</p>

<p>I admit that the trouble I find with his posts is that they are long, and fully of flowery prose and side remarks.  I can’t for the life of me get the main point, much less the argument for that point.  I <em>think</em> after my second reading is that he is saying this: What people in the computer proof world talk about (at least in the articles and statements he reads about this topic) is “progress” and the technological advancements that would come from formal proofs or computer generated proofs.  In his mind however, the main point of pure mathematics (and life in general) is the enjoyable activity of the pursuit of knowledge.  He admits that both Kevin Buzzard and John Harrison share this view, so he might be arguing more about either the way this is presented in articles or a fear that math will be less fun in the future when formalization has taken over.  I certainly have heard this argument before (and much more succinctly!).  I think it is a view that shouldn’t be taken lightly.</p>

<p>However, I do think one needs to be careful not to conflate ITPs and ATPs too much.  They are of a very different flavor and I think they will effect mathematics in different ways.  Also, I think that one talks about mathematics being taken over by machines, no one talks about how this will be a gradual process. When Szegedy talks about a decade he isn’t probably talking about Sholze level research (or really any research involving building new branches and tools in mathematics).  Also I don’t think Szegedy is talking about mathematicians loosing their jobs.  But he is also talking about a real noticeable advancement in the field of ATP as it relates to research mathematics.</p>

<p>Beyond <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="115715">@Jason Rute</span> 's troubles with Harris' prose and remarks (and pompous quotations), what disturbs be most is<br>
1) That he speaks for "mathematicians", as in his <strong>bold</strong> sentence <strong> What pure mathematicians find valuable about what we do is precisely that it provides a kind of understanding whose value is not determined by the logic of the market.</strong>: as a mathematician myself, I can say that my position towards the "logic of the market" is different from Harris';<br>
2) In general, the level of political economy he needs for the lens through which our work is looked at;<br>
3) When he says "Far from heralding a step toward making digitization routine, then, Scholze's initiative clearly expressed an intention to reserve such a step for exceptional circumstances.  And there are reasons to digitize with caution.  As historian Stephanie Dick observed in her study of early efforts to digitize mathematics, <em>In developing theorem-proving software, practitioners endowed mathematical objects with computational properties - they were translated into dynamic, algorithmic, discrete things.</em>": I might be too naif myself, but I have never seen in Scholze's initiative any "clear intention to reserve such a step for exceptional circumstances". I thought that he wanted to be sure of his theorem with Clausen, and was probably also a bit curious of the efforts needed for such a task, but it comes to me as a surprise to read that in Scholze's mind <em>digitization must be done with caution</em>. I wonder whether Harris has directly asked Scholze about this (as an aside: I am not sure that the quotation from Dick advocates for this caution neither, but this is another point).</p>

<p>Jason, I understand that Harris fears that math would become less fun with proof assistants. But he simply has no evidence to support that claim, only his fantasies.</p>

<p>I think his points are poorly argued, but it is not an unrealistic fear.

<p>As far as automated theorem proving, I’ve often heard the fear that it could take away the beauty of math.  For example, here is a quote from some private correspondence I’ve had:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I agree that advances in machine learning give us a lot to think about. I sometimes worry that everything we love about mathematics -- the clever ways that the right conceptualizations extend our cognitive reach -- are just crutches that we humans have developed to cope with the fact that we can't fit everything in our heads at once, and that we'll eventually give up and leave it to the cloud and machine learning will do everything we need.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="115715">@Jason Rute</span>  Honestly, I, as a computer scientist share much the same concerns about machine learning. I find that as machine learning has improved, it seems popular to just toss it a problem and hope it magically figures out a solution without the user ever having to understand the solution themselves. In fields where this works, it tends to decrease interest in research to fully conceptualize or formalize the problem as the machine can just produce the desired results.</p>
<p>When it comes to ATPs, though, I would think this would be a bit less of a concern. One can at least inspect the generated proof to figure out the way the machine got from point A to point B. Most other applications of machine learning don't have that luxury.</p>

<p>I certainly don't want to be dismissive, but I often imagine a world where some kind of formalisation becomes necessary, and I actually find it very nice! Of course this should not happen suddenly, and each community must find it <em>natural</em> before requesting this as a standard. But in the long run I simply see it as a very good thing, precisely as LaTeX. But I wonder if I am too naif.</p>

<p>I can't help but mention that <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-prove-2d-version-of-quantum-gravity-really-works-20210617/">one of the highlighted Quanta</a> articles of 2021 featured both my PhD supervisor (Antti Kupiainen) and my former PhD student (Eveliina Peltola) <span aria-label="big smile" class="emoji emoji-1f604" role="img" title="big smile">:big_smile:</span>. On the topic of counting doors, Eveliina is also nowadays <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span></span></span></span> doors from me on the same corridor at Aalto, where <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span></span></span></span> is a small positive constant, which is perhaps just a bit worse than Kevin's constant <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>4</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">4</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">4</span></span></span></span>. <span aria-label="grinning face with smiling eyes" class="emoji emoji-1f601" role="img" title="grinning face with smiling eyes">:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:</span>.</p>
<p>Ok, that was not Lean-related... But the mathematical topic of that Quanta article was probabilistic / constructive quantum field theory, and my longer term hope/goal is that mathlib's probability theory will catch up with at least some such uses in mathematical physics!</p>

<p>Not sure if this has been shared, maybe in the Lean for teaching stream. Happy to discuss it in a sibling thread. Edit: upon reading it, I think it's worth discussing only until section 4, inclusive. I think the later sections are not of substance that deal with mathlib-related issues.</p>

<p>I read this twice when Kevin retweeted it; I had a hard time discerning the author's point and it took me a second go to realize it wasn't my fault. They seem to be upset that proponents of formalism are promoting something as "proof" that lacks the elements of his definition of "proof" (as elucidated in the quote about Wiles). I haven't met anyone who thinks these concepts of proof are really in direct competition for anything, so I'm  not sure what they're upset about.</p>

<p>In Lean 3, you don't really want to use reflection because it moves computation from the relatively fast vm to the slower kernel. I understand Lean 4 has special support for fast proofs by reflection, and Coq definitely supports it well.</p>

<p>I don't know if it's written somewhere else, but the main feature in Lean 4 is the <code>reduceBool</code> operator: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/master/src/Init/Core.lean#L1035">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/master/src/Init/Core.lean#L1035</a></p>

<p>Note that <code>reduceBool</code> goes a bit further than proof by reflection in the lean 3 sense. It is more like "trusting <code>#eval</code>", it is an extra axiom and it goes outside the regular type theory (external verifiers can't follow it)</p>

<p>A smaller step toward faster kernel computation in lean 4 (which does not require new axioms) is that bignums are now part of the kernel spec: the <code>nat.add</code> and <code>nat.mul</code> functions work directly on nat literals represented as bignums in the kernel so they are orders of magnitude faster than lean 3.</p>

<p>I wonder whether there should be an attribute for "(un)trusted <code>implementedBy</code>", such that proofs by <code>reduceBool</code> are only allowed to use the trusted ones. (There are other reasons to use <code>implementedBy</code> where the concern is more about good codegen than proving, and so you probably want to default to untrusted.)</p>

<p>I would like at least to defend some of the ideas of the post. The central thesis I distilled is that this currently trendy branch of mathematical formalism, that a proof is a proof iff it can be transformed into a formal arrangement of symbols checked for syntactic correctness by an automated process, is merely an ideology that can/should/will be subverted by another. (I use ideology here in a more epistemological sense, as a set of beliefs that define which topics are considered useful to know, discuss or research.) Formalism certainly is not a universally accepted standpoint, even though it would be in the interest of the ITP community to agree with it unanimously.</p>
<p>What I really miss in the post is engaging with previous iterations of debates on mathematical formalism  — getting rid of the details about computers and cryptocurrency I can imagine Brouwer writing such an essay against Hilbert. So what makes the current situation interesting? Are there differences in kind or degree to that of the early 20th century?</p>

<p>This is exactly my issue with Harris' article and a previous one I had read as well. It feels like he's criticizing ITP by criticizing a strawman of the ITP community - there are certainly ITP folks with a hard formalist position, ones who think that formalized proofs should replace peer-reviewed formal proofs in natural language or ones who think that mathematics should be done by AI, but I don't think that these are positions held in general by the ITP community, or that they are even the main reasons why people are interested in ITP. <br>
This may in part be due to the running theme of his blog, with ITP being just one of multiple areas that he's commenting on from the same perspective, thus limiting the scope. </p>
<p>I'd also be more sympathetic to the article if the points were made less rhetorically (i.e. they'd read less like an LSD trip :-)), and I didn't feel like I'm spending more time trying to understand the points in the article than the author spent time writing it.</p>

<p>I personally found the article interesting.  It may be a bit meandering and have some strawman arguments, but the author was careful to insist this was about his values.  I've certainly heard FM researchers express disdain for results that haven't been formally specified and verified.  It's usually younger researchers and not the majority, but a sometimes vocal subgroup.<br>
I really like the field, but think it would be a tragedy if reviewers were to reject papers with interesting ideas that were not fully backed by formal proof.  That would only serve to further limit what could be expressed and considered, and academic CS is often too narrow as is in my opinion.</p>

<p>I have to say, I was somewhat taken aback by being characterized as putting forth a "militant but unsubstantiated attempt to ventriloquize mathematics." It's far from straightforward to try to extract from the post a clear understanding of what Harris' concerns are, and the extent to which they are incompatible with the aims of the Lean and mathlib community. I will leave it to others to engage in that debate. But, for the record, I'd like to point out that the quotation is taken from the first section of this paper:<br>
<a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/16725/1/reliability.pdf">http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/16725/1/reliability.pdf</a><br>
I hope that readers of the post will at least have the courtesy of reading that before weighing in on whether the snippet is militant and unsubstantiated.</p>

<p>Maybe this is for the mathlib ML channel, but given that the model can now prove statements, perhaps it can be modified to invent new tactics. What I mean by that, is create sensible subgoals, and extrapolate what steps it would like to take. Then if there are sequences of tactic states it would like to take, and that occurs often, maybe that's a missing tactic in our conceptual vocabulary that would be good to have. Stan, have you done training/validation where you ablate lemmas or tactics available to the model?</p>

<p>After reading Harris's article, the thing that struck me was that he seems to be confusing/conflating proof verification vs proof construction and logical vs rhetorical argument. The former is evidence by his rigorous vs heuristic distinction (which is exactly the separation between proof verification and construction lie) and the latter is by his artifact vs social process distinction (which is exactly where the separation between logical and rhetorical argument lie).</p>

<p>It also slightly concerns me that Harris thinks mathematical proof is primarily a social process (i.e., rhetoric). While it is true that arguments for parts of mathematics are fundamentally rhetorical in nature (i.e., belief in the plausibility of first principles like the law of the excluded middle), the hope (as I see it) is that rest of mathematics follows objectively/logically from these principles and is not merely a matter of rhetorical consensus.</p>

<p>Rhetorical consensus has a big part to play in practice (bigger than what some in the CS world realise, I suspect). As a formalist I would argue that logical deduction should have something to do with it but thinking about it now I think that one could argue that when it comes to getting your paper published all you're asking is that the referees say it's fine, and if none of them read section 4 properly because it was technical and they were busy then maybe Harris has a point that rhetorical consensus is actually what's going on in practice</p>

<p>The "social construct" part also means that what you write as a proof in a paper is not a proof, but a discourse intended to mean something along the lines of "let me convince you that somewhere in the cavern exists a proof of my result, if you wanted to recover it you would start from first principles and do this, that and the other thing, but <em>of course</em> this is not doable in practice" and so a large part is convincing other mathematicians rather than actually writing a proof.</p>

They get a bunch of UG speakers and a couple of bigshots and have a two day event. Of the 25 or so talks (covering pure and applied mathematics), three undergraduates chose to speak about Lean. Furthermore, none of those undergraduates are from Imperial! We have Yael (Cambridge), and then Hernan Ibarra Mejia from Sheffield (presumably they talked to Neil Strickland) and then Paul Lezeau from Warwick who worked with Damiano. I find this very exciting because it means this stuff is catching on with the younger generation.</p>

<p>I mentioned that result because it's something that I think is only possible with a large unified library like mathlib. The argument goes through the Riemann existence theorem, so it involves not just algebraic geometry, but also complex manifolds and algebraic topology.</p>

<p>Probably my French is not quite good enough and I missed it, but it seems that the article does not draw a clear distinction between interactive theorem proving and automated theorem proving. As long as computer proofs remain mostly interactive proofs, I am quite certain we're going to need many more human mathematicians :P</p>

<p>ICERM policy prohibited it. They got speakers to sign release forms to post the talks, but the idea with a panel is that you should be able to have informal discussions with people in the audience without having to worry about being recorded.</p>

<p>I have to admit I’m confused a bit by some of the points.  Is the main idea that Lean’s choice operator is what is called “global choice”, or  Hilbert’s epsilon operator?  And that this choice is stronger than what you get in ZFC?  The ZFC version is closer to AC used in HoTT?  Then realizing that AC and replacement are compatible with Univalence but global choice isn’t, this casts doubt on Mario’s argument in his thesis which seems to prove that one can get global choice in ZFC plus countably many large cardinals?  If this is the case, then Mario’s thesis only shows Lean is equiconsistent with ZFC plus large cardinals plus global choice? (I could be totally misunderstanding.)</p>

<p>Hi! Sorry, I barely open zulip anymore these days.</p>
<p>I can summarize the main points of the discussion here. In your thesis it is clear: You assume large enough cardinals to obtain universes <code>V_0,...,V_omega</code>, so that every type in the i-th universe is in <code>Vi</code>. By the axiom of choice, there exists a choice function that selects an element of every inhabited set in <code>V_ω</code>. Then I put my type-theory hat on again, to see if I could understand the argument from the type theoretic point of view. </p>
<p>Since we're here on the Lean zulip, let's assume that every type is a set. The axiom of choice asserts that <code>(∀(x:X), ∥Y(x)∥) → ∥Π(x:X), Y(x)∥</code>for every type <code>X</code> and every family of types <code>Y</code> over <code>X</code>. Applying this to <code>V_ω</code> we get that <code>(Π (X:V_ω), ∥X∥ → ∥X∥) → ∥Π(X:V_ω), ∥X∥ → X∥</code>. This is also how you apply it in your thesis. The thing I thought was a problem was that you only seem to get ∥Π(X:V_ω), ∥X∥ → X∥, but to interpret Lean's global choice you want <code>Π(X:V_ω), ∥X∥ → X</code>. Then Andrej pointed out that actually you're not _constructing_ a model, but you're proving that a model exists. This cleared up the discussion to me, but do you also see it this way?</p>

<p>In other parts of the discussion I was wondering what would be needed in type theory to get an implication <code>AC → Global-Choice</code>. </p>
<p>Andrej was very confused about what I wanted and suggested erroneously that this is possible in CIC. It is not. The argument here is as follows: The axiom of choice is consistent with the univalence axiom, but the global choice principle is not consistent with the univalence axiom. This implies that if we could simply prove global choice from AC, then in combination with univalence we would be able to reach a contradiction. Furthermore, any axiom that is compatible with the univalence axiom also won't help you prove global choice from AC. This leads to the question, what extra assumptions do we need to make about type theory in order for your argument to go through in type theory. I still don't know the answer. The suggestions by Andrej in that thread were not helpful. </p>
<p>So that is a summary of the other part of the discussion.</p>

<p>For a couple of years now, I have been working with <a href="https://starkware.co/">StarkWare</a>, using Lean to verify code for blockchain applications written in their programming language, <a href="https://www.cairo-lang.org/">Cairo</a>. We have just made public a system that generates Hoare descriptions and verifies them down to the Cairo machine model. That model, in turn, is verified down to the algebraic certificates that are published on blockchain. We have also made public a verification of Cairo library code that validates secp signatures. </p>
<p>We are in the process of writing a paper on these results, but in the meanwhile, the repository is available here:<br>

<p>Indeed, the method hasn't changed since the paper has been published. We got slightly better results but as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="308899">@Yakov Pechersky</span> notes, our proofs are still very much "search" biased : brute-forcing discrete cases or stumbling into recurrences that work by applying induction multiple times.  Math is definitely far from solved :p </p>
<p>Regarding the extension, Gabriel merged a PR yesterday that adds the API key / url as defaults for the vs-code plug-in (because searching in zulip wasn't ideal to find it and there is currently no alternative).</p>

<p>It's a bit of a reverse Lean in the wild, because it's not in the wild and you have to know that it's Lean, but this year's Zulip in review came this morning with <a href="/user_uploads/3121/pBdBOqnXUlyxSCQ-46YJ2GFZ/image.png">a conspicuous fourth top emoji</a>.</p>

<p>isn't that emoji popular here <em>because</em> Zulip suggested it as a default?</p>

<p>I can't search by reactions, but I can confirm it seems to have been a vicious cycle where the emoji was used because it was suggested, and it is still suggested because it gets used: <a href="#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus.20emoji">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/octopus.20emoji</a></p>

They started using Zulip ten years ago back when it was in private beta, so it's plausible that the Zulip developers added the octopus as a default emoji inspired by them. The actual visual effect probably depends on the user's emoji theme.</p>

The exact history is hard to pin down! TL;DR: during the early days of Zulip, we noticed that if you put an emoji on one line and the octopus emoji on the next line, it looked like the octopus was holding it up in celebration, like this: <a href="https://t.co/wTRwObg5Fz">https://twitter.com/recursecenter/status/1588260698978557952/photo/1</a></p><span>- Recurse Center (@recursecenter)</span><div class="twitter-image"><a href="https://t.co/wTRwObg5Fz"><img src="https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/12e22cc3de9c017251b4cc399037c9b6c68135aa/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f46677169723630586f4138576946622e6a70673a7468756d62"></a></div></div></div>
