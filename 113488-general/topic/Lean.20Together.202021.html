<p>In January <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/meetings/fomm2020/">2020</a> and <a href="https://lean-forward.github.io/lean-together/2019/">2019</a> we had Lean user meetings. Who says we can't repeat it in pandemic times? <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> and I are planning an online Lean Together 2021, the week of January 4. The exact dates and format are TBD, but mark that week on your calendars. We'll try to schedule things acceptably for various timezones, possibly starting at different times on different days. It's unlikely to be five full days.</p>
<p>A few preliminary ideas: we'd love to see casual WIP talks from any and everybody who has WIP to share. Anything formalization-related is in scope. I think a big point of these workshops is to get an idea of what other people around the world are working on and to coordinate efforts. We're not only looking for polished conference talks, and we'd like to leave plenty of time for discussion. We'll invite some speakers from outside the Zulip world, and you should feel free to spread this invitation.</p>
<p>Would you/your team/your research group possibly be interested in presenting something that week? Please let us know, either here or privately, with no commitment! Again, we hope for a mix of casual and more formal presentations, expecting more of the former.</p>

<p>A reminder to everyone, Lean Together 2021 is still in the works, and we'll get some more official info out before too long! But again, if you're at all interested in presenting something, please let us know. Informal WIP is not only okay, it's welcome and expected.</p>

<p>I've updated the LT2021 site with some more information. The workshop will happen the week of Jan 4, over a number of half-day sessions (with different start times to accommodate various time zones). Please:</p>
<ul>
<li>Volunteer to give a talk! Seriously, we'd love to see a short presentation about whatever fun thing you're formalizing at the time. Longer talks are welcome too of course.</li>
<li>Fill out the registration form. We'll post Zoom links here, but it's nice to brag about a long list of participants.</li>

<p>What did you prefer about wonder?</p>

<p>Last time we tried <a href="http://gather.town">gather.town</a>, connecting to zones took quite some time and the zone management seemed less flexible and intuitive to us (e.g. no visual bubble). The video and sound quality was also better on wonder. But maybe that has improved since then!</p>

<p>Rob, Chris and I found we could position ourselves in such a way that Chris could hear both of us, but I could not hear Rob, so perhaps there is no zone management and it's more like "you can hear someone iff they're at most x spaces from you".</p>

<p>oh, that's some surprising behaviour I'd say... ^^<br>
We'll use wonder for a Christmas social next week with quizzes, games, and mingling zones, all running at the same time. I'll let you know if we encounter difficulties :) <br>
One annoying restriction is that there's a 15 people limit on the number of people joining the same circle (not zone, there's no limit on that). See the <a href="https://support.wonder.me/hc/en-us/articles/360013499978-FAQs">FAQ</a>.</p>

I think we'll use wonder only because we don't fit in the free tier of gather and the functionality seems pretty equivalent.

<p>I think I've said it before here but I'd really recommend checking out using <a href="http://researchseminars.org">researchseminars.org</a> for conference schedules, it was created by mathematicians and they've thought a lot about all these timezone problems and many more helpful features (one can embed the schedule back in the conference webpage quite easily, people can add the schedule in their (google, ...) calendar, speakers can edit their own title and abstract and change slide links, etc etc).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="198376">Kevin Kappelmann</span> Curious to hear how the Christmas social goes. I think we'll use wonder only because we don't fit in the free tier of gather and the functionality seems pretty equivalent. The sprites and maps in gather are fun but not worth figuring out how to pay for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides the Christmas social (17 people), we also used it for another occasion (~25 people). Everything worked very well, the audio &amp; video quality was good. I think it works way better for mingling than having breakout rooms on some video conference system. </p>
<p>There are 2 annoying things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The 15 person/circle limit I mentioned before -- we hit that one once when a guest wanted to show some pictures to everyone. In theory, there's a broadcasting feature, but that's for hosts only. One could send the password to that one guest, but then they need to figure out how to broadcast... and maybe some guests don't want to see the broadcast and continue talking, which is not possible... As you can see, it is not a good solution to circumvent the 15 people/circle restriction.</li>
<li>There's a "lock this circle" feature at the top right of the window that some guests used by accident. It might be worth to give everyone a quick tour before sending out the meeting URL.</li>
</ol>
<p>All in all, I think it works very well, but the 15 people/circle restriction can be annoying. Personally, I think that more than 15 people in one group for mingling doesn't make much sense in most cases anyway, but as noted above, there are some exceptions where it would be useful.</p>

<p>For the use case I'm envisaging at LT2021 (small chats between people who don't all know each other already) I'm not sure this is going to be a problem -- was the issue that basically at a Christmas social there are a bunch of people you haven't seen for ages who you know white well and a group of 15 can form naturally?</p>

<p>In our case, it was a celebration for someone and another person wanted to show some funny pictures about the person to be celebrated. Naturally, everyone was curious and wanted to see them :p <br>
But besides that, circles tended to be ~10 people max and on average ~5-6 people.</p>

<p>There were some late additions to the program, talks that we wanted to hear but were proposed after we filled all our time slots. So we've added a "prerecorded session." These talks will be available as videos before the workshop starts, for you to watch at your leisure, and the speakers will be available at social hours for informal Q&amp;A sessions.</p>
