<p>But one thing to keep in mind is that the source files for mathlib don't themselves have to be the documentation -- Mathematica's rich documentation is all completely separate from the source code. One one hand, that makes it harder to remember to keep it up to date, but on the other it allows the documentation to have structure that's best for documenting (instead of needing to find compromises based on how the source is structured).</p>

<p>Are you asking for a used by list (and or a "uses" list) on theorems? That can very well be done in doc-gen4 by just processing the Exprs of all theorems and seeing what names pop up there is no need for special casing with <code>simp</code>.</p>

<p>Well, but I think a balance between making proofs readable (i.e. understandable for the interested mathematician) and making them <em>exploitable</em> (I cannot came up with a better term: I mean that someone can learn from them something about formalising, possibly formalising another similar lemma getting inspiration from that proof) would be useful. For instance, if a proof requires <code>a+b=b+a</code>, golfing <code>exact add_comm a b</code> to <code>exact add_comm _ _</code>is precisely the thing I would oppose: it adds nothing, but if one does not know yet how things works, the two underlines are genuinely painful.</p>

<p>An "uses" list would be ranked in reverse order, I think. So that the most "exquisite" declarations would come up on top to avoid always having the same declarations at the top of almost every "uses" list. For instance, seeing <code>nat.add_comm</code> at the top doesn't add a lot of info</p>

<p>Should the "used by" counter include transitive counts? For example if you have a very basic theorem in a theory you build up bigger and bigger statements from  that are each not used that often you won't really get a clear view of what is relevant without transitive counters right?</p>

<p>Oh right, I meant to respond to the "used by" comment. I think it's a fantastic idea; it's one of the features from the metamath HTML pages that I miss in doc-gen and it is really good for helping to identify places to look when doing refactors, in addition to being one way to explore the mathematical content of a formal development. (It should probably be accompanied by a list of theorems referenced as well, so that you can go both up and down the graph of theorem references. In metamath this is automatic since the proof display is itself a list of theorem applications, but in lean it is not as trivial to reconstruct the list of referenced theorems from the source because of tactics that can pull who knows what into the proof.)</p>

<p>I think it also heavily depends on what kind of result this is. Knowing <em>where</em> (or how many times) the proof that <code>a+b=b+a</code> is used in a commutative monoid is of no interest, but knowing which parts of commutative algebra rely on the Chinese remainder theorem might be interesting. Can't we think of a flag like the <code>simp</code> one, but for doc purposes?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if a proof requires <code>a+b=b+a</code>, golfing <code>exact add_comm a b</code> to <code>exact add_comm _ _</code>is precisely the thing I would oppose: it adds nothing, but if one does not know yet how things works, the two underlines are genuinely painful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am actually arguing the exact opposite. Replacing variable names with underscores makes the proof much more robust to refactorings (because if you rename a variable for X reason you don't have to change the underscore), and not having an underscore is a flag that not everything can be inferred, that there's a choice being made.</p>

<p>I disagree with top down proofs being harmful to readability. Top down reasoning is the way most people come up with proofs, and in my experience, the way most beginners to proofs try writing them. The only advantage I see to putting every next step into its own <code>have</code> block is that you can see the explicit term being proved, advantage made redundant by the goal view.</p>

<p>I think the idea of having some kind of compressed (but re-expandable) representation of proofs should be possible with the correct heuristics. </p>
<p>The simplest I think that can actually be somewhat informative is keeping only the tactics that depend on local hypotheses; i.e. if I have 12 rewrites, and only the 4th and 7th actually use a local hypothesis, then we only show something like <code>rw [h4, h7]</code>. It isn't valid code anymore, but one can interact with this using the cursor to show the goal state after <code>h4</code>, or after <code>h7</code>, and not see any of the intermediate steps. </p>
<p>The idea is that the human writing the proof probably rewrote <code>h4</code> as a key step, then did a bunch of <code>rw</code>s to simplify until they could use <code>h7</code>as a key step, etc. If this is a decent measure, then I feel like it would be fairly robust. </p>
<p>And of course, if the steps between <code>h4</code> and <code>h7</code> are not immediate, then one could expand to show the rewrites in between. How this expansion happens would be chosen heuristically. Maybe through some tagging system that ranks which tactics/lemmas should be erased? <code>@[simp]</code> has been pretty effective so far</p>

<p>I think there is, honestly, a tension here between multiple conceptions of what a proof even is, and what "readability" of a proof should be. Personally I favour a term-first style (I love using <code>refine</code> and <code>exact</code> and <code>rintros</code> etc. as much possible to really compress down a proof). But obviously such a thing doesn't produce a proof that is very useful for understanding the mathematics or understanding how to use a proof assistant, or even necessarily grant insight into how the proof assistant itself works.</p>
<p>There are a number of statements above that assume "readability" is one thing, and say whether or not it is good. My contention is that it very much isn't: to say a proof is readable without saying for whom and for what is meaningless.</p>
<p>Far more important to get right, in my view, are statements and definitions. Because of proof irrelevance, it doesn't matter to me how things are proved in Lean, as long as they are (well, with the caveat that one should avoid the use of slow tactics as much as possible - i.e. they should be efficiently verifiable). But it absolutely does matter to me how things are defined and stated. </p>
<p>As I also mentioned, there are also questions of "what are proofs for". Is a proof designed to convince a human of the truth of a statement through mathematical argument? This implies at least one kind of readability. Or perhaps it is simply meant to verify as correct a readable statement - that is another kind. And this is a social question as much as it is a technical one.</p>

<p>My view on proof irrelevance would be slightly different: since it does not matter for Lean how things are proved, it is better to have proofs that are human-readable (I don't think this statement is meaningless, even though human-readability is not well-defined). I agree that for trivial statements term-proofs are better (it shows that nothing interesting is happening) and if a proof is more readable then it should generally be easier to maintain.</p>
