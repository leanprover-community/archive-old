<p>Just to be clear, since I am one of those reactions, I'm not laughing at the lack of credit where credit is due to Johan. I completely agree that's a serious issue, and one that has already been addressed in the comments on Tim's post (and now in the post itself).</p>
<p>I'm laughing because, no matter how much Kevin may emphasize that he is not somehow the leader of the Lean community, that message never seems to register with people outside the community. Somehow people still think "any Lean project whatsoever = that thing Kevin is leading." I'm laughing at the apparent futility of trying to communicate this idea. (And obviously, Kevin <em>has</em> led and participated in some important Lean projects as well, which I guess adds fuel to this particular fire.)</p>

<p>Also it may be worth setting a clear separation between the Lean team and the mathlib team, thus making sure Leo gets the credit he deserves (I recall Quanta mentioned him as Â«Â a computer scientist at MC ResearchÂ Â»)</p>

<p>Re the separation of lean and mathlib: this is something else which the "general math public" also do not get for the most part. In fact in the past things were even worse: when I moved into this area I started a blog called the Xena Project which is a slightly nebulous concept driven by the idea that we should be getting young mathematicians to use theorem provers (something I still believe very deeply). By about 2019 it seemed that most casual observers in the maths community couldn't tell the difference between Xena, Lean and mathlib and it was at around this point that Patrick told me that more of an effort was needed on my part to start distinguishing between them. Apparently the current state of play is that now people in the maths community can't tell the difference between Kevin Buzzard, Lean and mathlib which is in some sense even worse. Perhaps it's time for some kind of Xena blog post attempting to put this thing to bed once and for all.</p>

<p>Everything concerning the Lean=Kevin or the LTE=Kevin problems has been perfectly addressed and I have nothing to add, I just want to say a word about the <code>mathlib</code>=Lean issue. I think our community has some true responsibility here, not only "the press": going <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/index.html">here</a> I am on the webpage of the "Lean Community"; and the title is "Lean and its Mathematical LIbrary", already presenting them as a whole. Moreover, clicking on <code>GitHub</code> on the left panel, the link redirects to the <code>mathlib</code> repository, not to the <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/">one</a> containing the Lean code. Finally, further below, there is a "Library overview" (clearly pointing to <code>mathlib</code>) but presenting is as the <em>only</em> library that matters in <code>Lean</code>. I think that it is completely normal that nobody sees a difference between Lean and <code>mathlib</code>: I am not claiming this is right, but if we want this to change (and probably we should more honestly ask ourselves whether this is the case), something must be done from our side.</p>

<p>It clouds the matter further that mathlib uses a community fork of Lean, which is now developed only by people who aren't Leo</p>

<p>I believe some of this change should come automatically once  Lean 4 becomes the mainly used version, we already have some regular programming going on and I'd hope it will only increase from now on so one would expect more and more non mathlib (in fact even non mathematical) Lean libraries to pop up.</p>

<p>You're right. I need to email Tim about an unrelated matter; I'll mention it.</p>

<p>I'd be far more interested in hearing from the AI/ML people about how feasible Tim's project is.</p>

<p>In reading the manifesto one thought that was constant in my mind was, <br>
Is anyone aware of <a href="https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=chr-intro">CHR</a> and/or using CHR for theorem proving?</p>
<p>.&gt; Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) is a committed-choice rule-based language embedded in Prolog. It is designed for writing constraint solvers.</p>
<p>So the way I am thinking is that CHR would be a meta language used to construct several constraint solvers and those could be used for certain areas of math.  For getting the solvers to communicate, I only have guesses at present.</p>
<p>As for defining cheating I was expecting to see something asking for a pedigree.</p>
<p>Anyway, those are some thoughts I had and hopefully this will break the ice so that others might toss up their thoughts.</p>

<p>FYI <br>
I am not an expert in CHR but keep it in my toolbox for problem solving if ever there be a need.<br>
Found this paper which might let others see why some of us like CHR.  It gives a nice run down of ways in which CHR has/is being used with references.</p>
