<p>hi! i am following sporadically the Lean/Xena project (always having in mind to jump in at some point, maybe with a student). After watching some of the recent talks on youtube on the summer projects, i was wondering, how one tracks the progress of the mathlib. Is there a website where you have listed all of the definitions and theorems you want to implement? With updates when they are implemented? </p>
<p>Also, after a theorem or definition is defined in Lean, can it be used in the formalization of other definitions/theorems?</p>
<p>Are there also some funded projects in Lean (for instane, a bounty on some certain theorems/proofs)?</p>

<p>I'm not aware of any bounties. But people have gotten some personal grants (that they typically applied for themselves) to work on Lean projects.</p>

<p>I was going through the list, and I wonder whether it is complete. For instance, i know that there are a number of nice graph theory proofs (e.g. Hall's marriage theorem) that have been formalized, but i cant find any of those concepts in the list.</p>

<p>yes but it is sufficiently preliminary that I am not particularly talking about it yet (e.g. right now there are 0 links to mathlib)</p>

<p>Ah OK thanks, thats a great way to have a roadmap for formalizing the whole undergrad curriculum. Is this where the motivation comes from? (i.e. you can claim that the Xena project has succeeded when each element in that list is formalized)?</p>
<p>Are there systematic lists of other theorems, for example those theorems from summer projects? Are they standalone projects or actaully included into the mathlib?</p>

<p>This is very useful for searching, thanks - i will play with it! Can it also be used to keep track of the progress? i.e. to see what has been added in the last few weeks? This is what i couldnt find yet as a non-expert so far, but probably it exists.</p>

<p>(Just want to mention that the version of the theorem we have (<a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/finset.all_card_le_bUnion_card_iff_exists_injective">docs#finset.all_card_le_bUnion_card_iff_exists_injective</a>) is essentially Hall's original formulation, which makes no mention of graphs.  It seems that pedagogically graphs are used because they help with visually organizing the information, but it turns out they're not essential to the argument. There is a graph formalization, but we haven't gotten around to actually cleaning it up for inclusion in mathlib.</p>
<p>Also, thanks for mentioning the theorem, I completely forgot <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7825">#7825</a> was never merged, which removes the restriction that <code>ι</code> be finite!)</p>
