<p>DeMillo, Lipton, and Perlis (Social Processes and Proofs of Theorems and Programs) seem to believe that a proof checker has to grind a proof all-the-way-down every time. That is, the proof checker cannot assume that axioms hold and that every axiom needs to be re-proven as it is used. Is this how the lean proof checker works? Or does it 'believe' an axiom?</p>

<p>Axioms are not proven at all. That's what makes them axioms.<br>
Do you have in mind lemmas? Of course Lean does not re-check the proof of a lemma every time it is applied.</p>

<p>Programs aren't the same as proofs. Programs are a certain kind of proof. Lean is quite happy with proofs that aren't programs. Mathematicians use the word proof to mean something more general than a program</p>

<p>The view that everything needs to be re-proven seems (to me) to be implicit in their argument against verification. Social processes allow "proofs" to hand-wave the assertion that "we could prove it down to the metal if we wanted". They argue that verifications will involve dozens of pages. A verification of the GCD algorithm, if everything is expanded in all its glory (i.e. reproven) might take several pages but mathematical proofs rest on prior proofs, making them shorter, so I don't see that their objection is reasonable.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>AFAIU <code>meta</code> is gone in lean4.  However many interesting parts are implemented using an FFI to C++ code, and for those functions that are imported from C++ you can only prove that they produce <em>some</em> result value, but not which one.</p>

<p>Even the kernel makes use abstraction IE  "<code>theorem_x : T := h1 h2 h3</code> type-checks, so don't bother re-checking it at subsequent use sites". It's definitely the case that internally, Lean produces more data than a human would want to deal with in the process of convincing itself something is admissible, but isn't that why we're using computers in the first place?</p>
<p>As for an example of a program accepted by Lean, some minimal examples would be like the read/write registers that are used as a state_t tutorial in "Programming in Lean". Even just array access in lean using <code>fin</code> is a very cool example of a tiny program with a built-in spec that ensures all accesses are in-bounds . Off the top of my head I can't think of any good examples that aren't <code>meta</code>, but a lot of those could probably be un-meta'd just by giving them a gas parameter to ensure termination.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> Lean is in the philosophy department (Avigaid is in both Philosophy and Math). The CMU CS department is heavily into types (Pfenning, Harper, Crary, Balzer, etc). I didn't see anyone from the Math department ( maybe my limitation).  Computational Mathematics seems to be a hybrid discipline. Harper's book "Practical Foundations for Programming Languages" is certainly at the leading edge. I highly recommend it.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> One problem, not at all obvious to the Lean cohort, is the notation. A mathematician, on seeing a judgement, asked "what is that funny fraction?". It took me several courses and quite a while to be able to read papers containing whole pages of greek fractions with any understanding. The logic courses I took at CMU were all in the CS and Philosophy departments, not the math department. If you can read judgements then it doesn't seem to be a problem but if you can't it is a MAJOR barrier to understanding. And it is not an easy barrier to overcome.</p>

<p>Axiom has first class dependent types and insists on types EVERYWHERE. Those who know types find it painfully obvious. Those who don't find it obviously painful. It is a very steep learning curve. My mathematics background (covering results up to 1799) never mentioned types.</p>

<p>Lot's of mathematicians have an intuitive understanding of types. Often, during a talk, someone will raise a question, asking "Where does <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">x</span></span></span></span> live?". That's just asking for the type of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">x</span></span></span></span> in disguise. So that's not the problem. Most mathematicians are enthusiastic about dependent type theory when you explain it to them.<br>
They have never formalised something.<br>
People who <em>know</em> types find it <em>obviously painful</em>. Ask Mario. Ask anyone here who has met the "motive is not type correct" error.<br>
That's why Mario is developing MM0 as a system that is <em>not</em> based on type theory.</p>

<p>Mathematicians find algebra painfully obvious until they try to use a computer algebra system, especially a strongly-typed system. </p>
<p>The type theory area is, like Lisp, an "enlightenment event"... you don't get it, you still don't get it, you wonder why ANYONE would get it, and then.... you wonder why anyone does anything else. Like Lisp, it is obviously correct you try to tell the next person... who doesn't get it.</p>

<p>This is a serious problem, though. It occurs in every area of math I've touched. I maintained a "computer algebra system" called Magnus, which is a special area called Infinite Group Theory. It took a long time to "come up to speed" on the notation, not to mention the concepts they represent, and then the dance one has to do to input math into a computer.

<p>it's certainly often not easy to convince yourself that these rules are exactly the ones you want. in many cases, the theorems you prove about the rules are what provides the insight.<br>
i'm not convinced that this is at all limited to computational mathematics, though; i'm sure one could dig up plenty of logic papers where this notation is used and it's also difficult to understand why the rules are what you want. <br>
you might not even need the notation, i'm sure one could spend a while pondering about the zfc axioms :)</p>

<p>I think this is the right idea. My work on lean's type theory, and MM0, are in the area of <em>foundations of mathematics</em> (or foundations of theorem provers if you prefer). It is not and should not be relevant for all mathematicians. The mark of a good foundation is that it stays in the background where you never have to see it. It is just there to answer questions in case you acquire some existential dread that nothing you are doing makes any sense.</p>
<p>In particular, for anyone that is wondering if MM0 would have any effect on their work: if you are doing math in lean, just keep doing what you are doing. Someday the whole foundation of lean might shift to something else, but it will be done in such a way that all the constructs built on top will be unaffected (modulo some engineering challenges that are my problem and not yours).</p>

<p>Hales remarked in his talk in Pittsburgh last week that mathematical notation seems to fit very well with dependent type theory. Apparently we do know what we're doing, but just use exotic notation to express types for historical reasons.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> You've made a call for formalizing mathematics (in Lean). Tony Hoare (<a href="https://vimeo.com/39256698" target="_blank" title="https://vimeo.com/39256698">https://vimeo.com/39256698</a>) has made another "Grand Challenge" call, which in my mind, also involves Lean. Hoare says his Grand Challenge is targeted at software engineering and the science of programming. The challenge consists in the construction, evaluation, and deployment of a high level programming language compiler, one that verifies the correctness of each program that it compiles. In my mind, Lean has a central role in his Grand Challenge.</p>
