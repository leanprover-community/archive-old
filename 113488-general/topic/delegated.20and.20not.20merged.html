<p><a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/labels/delegated">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/labels/delegated</a> shows a list of PRs that have been delegated and not merged. I think that it's likely a good idea to tidy these up and maybe un-delegate some, so that they aren't randomly merged in future.</p>
