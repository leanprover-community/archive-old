<p>I'm currently spamming the PR queue with little lemmas; at the moment, my goal is to get my proof of <code>ɸₙ(1) = 1</code> for <code>n</code> not a prime power (see <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/eval-cyclotomic-eq-one/src/temp.lean">here</a> for an effectively sorry-free version). I think this has been said to be the correct approach to lemmas like this; however, I still feel like it's so many PRs. Should I keep going like this, or wait till some of my current ones are merged before carrying on?</p>

<p>As a reviewer, I greatly prefer many standalone PRs over one do-everything PR. It should also be nicer for other PRs, since reviewers can do a couple of your PRs and then focus on other contributors'. The main cost in my experience is that long dependency chains will tend take a couple of weeks to get through the system, so you might need to be more patient.</p>
