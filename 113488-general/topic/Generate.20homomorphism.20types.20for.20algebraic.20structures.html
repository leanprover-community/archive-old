<p>Hello everyone,<br>
I have finally cleaned up the code for auto-generating homomorphism types for algebraic structures.<br>
The idea is that for structures like monoid, group, ring, ..., the type of homomorphisms can simply be read from the definition: morphisms need to be "compatible with all operations".<br>
The code linked below generates the structure of homomorphisms and the lemmas that compositions of homomorphisms and identities are homomorphisms, and defines the <code>concrete_category</code> belonging to the structure.<br>
Moreover, it defines forgetful functors, whenever one structure is an extension of another (in the sense of also having its fields), and the respective instances.<br>
Below the code there is a brief section of examples, also listing current restrictions (e.g. only "old style" structures).<br>
<a href="https://github.com/faabian/mathlib/blob/3.5/meta.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/faabian/mathlib/blob/3.5/meta.lean">https://github.com/faabian/mathlib/blob/3.5/meta.lean</a><br>
I think this is relevant because, as pointed out by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span>  and others, currently the library does not reflect the link between a class of objects and its (manually defined) homomorphism type.<br>
A goal might be to create a "table" linking structures to their manually defined homomorphism types (e. g. for topological spaces) and to auto-generate the ones for structures derived from these (e. g. topological groups).</p>

<p>Does it need Lean 3.5?</p>

<p>I think that in the end it does not.</p>

<p>No it doesn't, structure declarations are now made with emit_code_here, not the Lean 3.5 interface</p>
