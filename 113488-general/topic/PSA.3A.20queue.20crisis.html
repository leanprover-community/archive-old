<p>Dear mathlib community, you may have noticed that the PR <a href="https://bit.ly/3zVLgqR">#queue</a> has sky-rocketed over the last few weeks. This is a sign that activity is booming, and we are very happy about that! But it is also causing a lot of unnecessary stress among the community because of neglected PRs, PRs blocking progress, etc...<br>
As maintainers we are aware of this "minor crisis", and we want to come with a scalable long-term solution. Please bear with us for a few more days while we develop a proposal, and stay tuned! -- The maintainer team</p>

<p>While the process might not be as quick as desired by the author of a PR, the end result is that I'm usually <em>much</em> happier with the merged PR than the original proposal!</p>
<p>So, maintainers, thank you very much for all your hard work and know that I am incredibly grateful about the whole process: I'd rather it be slow and thorough than quick and sloppy!</p>
