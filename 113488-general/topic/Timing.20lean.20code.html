<p>To my great happiness, I have reached a point in my <a href="https://github.com/BoltonBailey/formal_baby_snark">formalization of SNARKs</a> project where there is a full proof of the soundness of (one version of) the well-known Groth '16 SNARK. Thanks to everyone on this forum for answering questions along the way, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> in particular for all of his help with tactic programming.</p>
<p>I'm currently doing what I can to try to speed up the proof a little. My approach for benchmarking the proof has mainly been to just remove the olean file, then run <code>time lean --make src/snarks/groth16typeIII/knowledge_soundness.lean</code>. This has been roughly consistent - <code>time</code> reports that it takes about 33 minutes of cpu time on average, with a standard deviation of maybe 3 minutes or so.</p>
<p>Are there any good ways of making more fine-grained measurements of the amount of time taken by individual parts of the proof?</p>

<p>You might try <code>set_option profiler true</code>.</p>

<p>You might also want to include a CI script that auto-updates mathlib, and makes an issue when mathlib master is incompatible with your repo. This makes maintaining mathlib parity much more straightforward.</p>

<p>(There's an example script on the community website <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/ci.html#upgrade-lean-and-mathlib-versions-on-schedule">here</a>.)</p>
