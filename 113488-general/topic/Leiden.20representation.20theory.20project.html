<p>Hi all,</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="280685">@Jesse Vogel</span>  and I organize an informal <a href="https://pub.math.leidenuniv.nl/~vogeljt/lean/">Lean workshop in Leiden</a> for PhD students and up.<br>
The first phase of this workshop, teaching everyone the basics, is coming to an end, and we plan to start phase two soon, where with a smaller group (6ish) we plan to contribute to mathlib.</p>
<p>Having checked the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad_todo.html">todos</a>, I was thinking to go for representation theory, in the direction of Burnside's theorem on solvable groups.<br>
It seemed like a good idea to sanity check this idea with the comunity, and also get in touch with the people working on the representation theory in Lean.<br>
I hope it is not considered rude to @ some recent contributors on github (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="118107">@Amelia Livingston</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="238446">@Anne Baanen</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="329754">@Antoine Labelle</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="284160">@Eric Rodriguez</span>).</p>
<p>Our rough plan would be to split up in two teams, one writing theorems with sorry's, and one replacing sorry's with proofs.<br>
I think we will follow HW Lenstra's lecture notes, but maybe we will find a better source.<br>
At least two people on our team have contributed to mathlib before, so I expect the git experience to go relatively smoothly.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Daan</p>

<p>This has stalled while I work on other things, but I started a tutorial based on Etingof's representation theory notes, at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/13911">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/13911</a>, which some may find helpful/inspiring/adoptable. :-)</p>

<p>Glad to see more people interested in representation theory in Lean!</p>

<p>I'm also interested in representation theory (my expertise is more towards representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras though, and recently I haven't had much time for Lean unfortunately). Do you think it would make sense to create a representation theory stream on Zulip or do you have some separate communication platform?</p>

<p>When Galois theory was being developed there was a separate public stream which was mostly just questions and answers from the Berkeley crowd who were developing it (Galois theory was also developed by a small group who were physically in one place) and I thought it worked really well. I would read the stream but those not interested in Galois theory could just mute it</p>

<p>We do not have any method of communicating other than in person meet-ups, so a stream here might be a good idea. I am not sure if I have the rights to create one.</p>
