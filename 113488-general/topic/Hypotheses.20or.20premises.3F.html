<p>In Theorem Proving in Lean, it seems to me that "hypothesis" is used to describe "that which is assumed." But to me as a scientist, hypotheses are posed and then tested for validity; they are more like conjectures. Is this confusing for anyone else? Is "hypothesis" generally used this way among mathematicians?</p>
<p>I'd probably prefer to use "premise" to describe "that which is assumed," rather than "hypothesis." Would there be any issue with that?</p>

<p>In logic, the P in "if P then Q" is often known as the <em>antecedent</em> or the <em>hypothesis</em> of the proposition. In a goal state, it probably would be more precise to call the corresponding terms <em>premises</em> or <em>assumptions</em>, though you'll see in written proofs that something is true "by assumption" or "by hypothesis" interchangeably.</p>

<p>Maybe one way to think of it is that each theorem you prove is an experiment that shows what else would need to be true if a given hypothesis were true -- proofs are in a sense evidence against their hypotheses.</p>

<p>This is standard mathematical terminology, isn't it? Assumption and hypothesis are synonymous.</p>

<p>I don't think we should change terminology only because physics and biology use the word hypothesis with a different meaning. And this has nothing to do with proof assistant. The name clash is already there in real life and when I teach maths to physics or biology majors I always emphasize this to prevent confusion.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hypothesis">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hypothesis</a> mentions all these meanings, but the etymology seems to support the mathematical / grammatical meaning more than the scientific one</p>
