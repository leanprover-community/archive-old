<p>Is there an easy way to perform induction with a "different starting element"? (easy = without writing a lemma <span aria-label="wink" class="emoji emoji-1f609" role="img" title="wink">:wink:</span> ). Perhaps some way to leverage the existing induction theorem?<br>
In my case, I want to prove something about <em>nonempty</em> finsets. Namely, that finite sup in a directed set stays in the directed set:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">lemma</span> <span class="n">test</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">α</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">decidable_eq</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">complete_lattice</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">S</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">set</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">hdir</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">directed_on</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="bp">≤</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="n">S</span><span class="o">)</span>
  <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">F</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">finset</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">hemp</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">F.nonempty</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">hF</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="bp">↑</span><span class="n">F</span> <span class="bp">⊆</span> <span class="n">S</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">F.sup</span> <span class="n">id</span> <span class="bp">∈</span> <span class="n">S</span> <span class="o">:=</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I'd love to start with </p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">apply</span> <span class="n">finset.induction</span> <span class="n">F</span><span class="o">,</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>but alas, this is only necessarily true for nonempty finsets.<br>
I've had the same case before when wanting to prove something about positive naturals, so I thought I'd ask for some tips.</p>

<p>You can probably just use the usual induction principle in any given case. Or you can just write your own and <code>apply</code> it. Why do you think the usual induction principle won't work for you? I think that all other induction principles are derived from it, in some sense. What happens after applying finset.induction? The base case should be provable by contradiction, no?</p>

<p>Well, the base case here needs <code>⊥ ∈ S</code>, which I have no reason to assume for an arbitrary directed set <code>S</code>. But, I think I see what you're saying - namely a "custom" induction principle will not be hard to write since it can simply use the regular one?</p>

<p>You just prove by induction that <code>⊥ ∈ S -&gt; P S</code></p>

<p>the implication ensures that the case <code>S = ⊥</code> is vacuously true</p>

<p>Ah, that's perfect! I had tried something like that in proving the implication <code>F.nonempty -&gt; F.sup id in S</code> by induction, but rather your proposition is what I need. Thanks!<br>
Well, wait, this would still ensure I need bottom in S anywhere to apply it...</p>
