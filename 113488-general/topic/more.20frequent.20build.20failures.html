<p>I seem to have the impression that the CI runners are much less reliable than they were, say, 6 months ago. It certainly feels like I'm hitting an undeserved failed build on every 3rd build or so. I'm not actually keeping track, but this is my estimation. Is my feeling accurate? If so, do we know why it is happening more frequently? Is it only that build times are longer and hence there is a better chance of interruption?</p>

<p>(moved from CI stream since that's only for actual CI bot output and a lot of folks are deliberately unsubscribed from it)</p>
