<p>I remember sometime ago watching a Xena Project video that suggested formalizing Tao's Analysis using Lean. I was wondering if anyone knows if that project was ever undertaken?</p>

<p>Not that I know of. But <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> has a better overview of which projects are going on.</p>

<p>I don't know of any analysis being developed in any places other than melon e branches</p>

<p>This could be a good exercise. Ideally every numbered lemma in Tao's Analysis (or indeed, in any high-quality "standard" textbook) would be a one-liner given what is in mathlib. Three types of contributions to mathlib that could follow from this ideal:</p>
<ol>
<li>adding statements to mathlib where it's not already a one-liner from existing material</li>
<li>adding cross-references to the textbook in doc-strings. (I think having only a handful of these is not valuable, but personally I would be excited about a PR that added a cross-reference to every result in entire chapter(s) of a book like this.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Historically, however, it seems very few books have been exhaustively formalised in Lean. More likely people pick an end-goal, and then when they discover something is tough to formalise they sometimes pick a bourbaki-type book to help guide the design, but still only implement from that source what is necessary for their goal.</p>
