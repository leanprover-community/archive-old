<p>I forget whether this has been discussed before, but would it be possible to create a mode in which any lemma that would be proved in a side thread is instead just replaced by <code>sorry</code>?</p>

<p>I know it's possible in principle for other stuff to examine these proofs, but hopefully (especially with the recent change involving <code>irreducible</code>) it doesn't actually happen...</p>

<p>Ideally, one could parse and then discard the contents of all top-level <code>lemma</code>s for example.</p>

<p>Yes, it would be possible.  Just put a <code>mk_sorry</code> in the right place.  I tried this a few years (?) ago.  It has some effect, but it's not an "espresso" build.</p>

<p>Alternatively, it can thunk a proof and run it only if it is required, with the proof never being run if it is never used</p>

<p>That would be ideal, yes. But the demand might only occur while compiling another module, so it sounds complicated, especially if you want to reuse the proof...</p>
