<p>Next installation problem: I installed Lean on Windows according to <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/windows.html">https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/windows.html</a>, but with manually installing elan. But I got Lean version 3.42.1 instead of the curent version 4.0.0. Somewhere is written that Lean 4 doesn't has the mathlib library. Another source writes that Lean 4 doesn't use leanpkg.toml, that would be a Lean 3 thing. But elan works with leanpkg.toml.<br>
1.) Are these information still up to date?<br>
2.) What is the right directory for installing Lean 4.0.0?</p>

<p>The way to install Lean 4 is: <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/setup.html#basic-setup">https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/setup.html#basic-setup</a><br>
Lean 4 doesnt have a full port of mathlib but a very minimal subset: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4</a> if you are interested in higher level mathematics you wont get happy with this though<br>
We use lake and lakefiles instead of leanpkg.toml</p>

<p>Thank you for this quick answer. It's valuable also for other new users. Thanks.</p>

<p>Elan can download both lean 3 and lean 4 for you (and any subversion of those also), as there are significant numbers of people using both lean 3 and lean 4 right now this is by design.</p>
