<p>Here is the theorem I am trying to prove:<br>
Let n &gt; 1. If n has no positive prime factor less than or equal to sqrt(n), then n is prime.</p>
<p>Here is a proof from Hungerford's Abstract Algebra:<br>
Suppose n has the given property but assume that n is not prime. Then n has at least two positive prime factors, say p1 and p2, so that n = p1p2k for some positive integer k. By hypothesis, n has no positive prime divisors less than or equal to sqrt(n). Hence p1 &gt; sqrt(n) and p2 &gt; sqrt(n). Hence n = p1p2k &gt;= p1*p2 &gt;n. Contradiction.</p>
<p>I am new to lean, so I am trying to translate proofs in textbooks for practice. Can anyone please tell me how to translate this proof into Lean code?</p>
