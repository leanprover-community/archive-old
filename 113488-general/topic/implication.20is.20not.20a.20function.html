<p>Levels 2-6 and 3-8 represent branch points in [the natural number game v1.0]. The truth of the matter is that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="132175">@Mohammad Pedramfar</span> 's game maker currently will only let me let the user create a certain kind of structure, and basically I can't get the user to get from 2-6 to 3-1 without forcing other levels on them to add to their left hand box -- stuff I don't want them to see. I have only just realised that one can guide a mathematician to a tactic mode proof that the  natural numbers are a commutative semiring -- this is "mathematician collectible <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/6" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/6">#6</a>" -- without <em>ever being introduced to the concept of a function</em>.

<p>The groupings of the levels are (2-1 to 2.6), (2-7 to 2-16), (3-1 to 3,8), ... Currently I want to write "Level 6 and a half -- you are not going to believe this -- they think that <code>succ_inj</code> is a <em>function</em>! rofl. Here, let me tell about this thing called <code>intro</code>.". What is going on here?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="228602">@Sian Carey</span> was a UROP student with me from Leeds over the summer, and I gave her a really technically difficult problem about constructing a theory of quotient monoids and I found it absolutely fascinating teaching her, but there were some concepts which I could see I was teaching her poorly. And then I showed her the natural number game and said I needed a power world and she just knocked one off. There are secret collectibles in the natural number game, which I couldn't figure out how to add to the system in its current form but you can see them in the source code. Mathematicians like collecting them.</p>

<p>This explains a lot of the errors I've been getting! Let me try to remember where they were.</p>
<p>In 3.11 after the split I wanted to just type "exact eq_zero_or_eq_zero_of_mul_eq_zero," </p>
<p>When that didn't work I tried "exact eq_zero_or_eq_zero_of_mul_eq_zero a b," (with various combinations of parentheses). </p>
<p>Finally I realized  I could "apply the function" with something like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>intro hyp,
apply eq_zero_or_eq_zero_of_mul_eq_zero,
exact hyp,
</pre></div>

<p>Similarly I was hoping to compose succ_inj with the inductive hypothesis "hn : n + b = n + c → b = c," in 2.9 but instead had to settle for</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>intro hyp,
apply hn,
apply succ_inj,
exact hyp,
</pre></div>

<p>I need to tell you about <code>have</code>. You want to reason forwards because that's the way your <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mtext>  </mtext><mo>⟹</mo><mtext>  </mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\implies</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.549em;vertical-align:-0.024em;"></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">⟹</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span></span></span> goes. But their <code>→</code>goes backwards!</p>

<p>I have made things worse by trying to do something super-clever with fancy <code>{{</code> brackets and breaking the thing which you instinctively want to do.</p>

<p>This happened to me in world2! I had to put an <code>@</code> before the theorem so I could move forward</p>
