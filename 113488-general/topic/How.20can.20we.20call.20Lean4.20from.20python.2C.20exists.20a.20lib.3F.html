<p>Question in title.  Just wondering if anyone has a snippet to share (in Python3 / PyQt5).   I want to make something like a Duo Lingo but for learning math.  The users will speak in English and there will be a database (Python dictionary or Levenshtein DFA for now) that matches user input to a line of code in Lean4.  Because each game is small, "draw the naturality square [for the givens of the Yoneda lemma]".  But I want everything to be logically checked using Lean4.  I know this sounds ambitious, but I already have the diagram editing part done.  I even have different math styles for the arrows working.  I might have say all the parts of the diagram in a box on the right.  The user then drags/drops/positions the items until the diagram matches.  So that wouldn't even require the English-to-Lean4 matching - that particular game.  So each game is small, which means the matching task is not out-of-reach as a coder.</p>

<p>By "a line of code" do you mean something closer to a function call, or to a line in a tactic block?</p>

<p>The goal is learning software.  Because that's I believe where the bottleneck of the world's math understanding is.  What good is it if Lean4 "knows" all this math, but we don't know 1/10th of it?  That's why gamification of learning is so cool and I'd like to work in that area.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="310045">@Eric Wieser</span> that's neat and in the same idea area, however any user input that is foreign to most mathematicians, i.e. any notation / tools that are not English-math + diagrams as seen in a textbook, are off limits to me.  I want the software to have close to zero getting started time.</p>

<p>So how the math is presented in the software, that's exactly the format you can communicate back with, with some leeway for typos, other ways of LaTeXing and so on..<br>
With Lean4, we could even do other ways of proof.</p>

<p>Anything that can be proven by Lean4 I'm interested in.    I'm not converting all English-math into Lean4 nor generating it from code.  I'm only needing to match a few examples that the users provide (like Duo Lingo).  For example there would be a lot of code re-use because how often do we use statements such as "Let x be in X".  And so on...  the matcher will know what to write into the formal proof, but these proofs are &lt; 50 lines (usually - think textbook proofs).  If the proof checks out, then the user passes go, so each game could actually be Lean4 checked.</p>

<p>What I'm saying is the Levenshtein matcher will only let in a "Levenshtein-fuzzy regular language" around 50 or so possibilities from an alphabet of Lean4 instructions (lines), so in a sense I've broken down the problem of having to convert <em>all of known English-math</em> into Lean4.  We just work on a exercise-by-exercise bases, so that that highly complex problem is now easier.</p>

<p>I guess in that case, I could do this without Lean4 though. :)</p>
