<p>I love VScode autocomplete. However, I don't like that it grabs control of my arrow keys when I least suspect it. But I can't find a config option to say that I want <code>Alt+arrow</code> to navigate in the autocomplete menu, and normal arrow keys to just close the window and move the cursor in the editor pane.<br>
Does anyone know how to do this?</p>

<p>This isn't quite what you asked for, but I know you can have autocompletion triggered by a keypress.</p>
