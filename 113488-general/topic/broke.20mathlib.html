<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I'm was working on fixing a problem with the norm_cast tactic, and it seems like I broke something in data/list.<br>
The thing is, this part of the code doesn't use norm_cast, and doesn't seem to use coercion at all for that matter.<br>
Plus, the error messages I get are about the equation compiler and pattern matching.<br>
Could someone take a look and help me figure out what I'm looking at?<br>
Here is the incriminated commit: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/1103/commits/4daf46595da984c2947a771d269e9acd64b0afc1" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/1103/commits/4daf46595da984c2947a771d269e9acd64b0afc1">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/1103/commits/4daf46595da984c2947a771d269e9acd64b0afc1</a></p>

<p>I created a dedicated thread in 'PR reviews', it seems more appropriate than the general stream</p>
