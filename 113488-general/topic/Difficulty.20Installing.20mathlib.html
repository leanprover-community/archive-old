<p>I followed the instructions here: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib</a></p>
<p>Everything seemed fine: no error messages but the directory $HOME/.mathlib only contained the following files and nothing more.</p>
<p>.<br>
./bin<br>
./bin/auth_github.py<br>
./bin/cache-olean<br>
./bin/delayed_interrupt.py<br>
./bin/setup-lean-git-hooks<br>
./bin/update-mathlib<br>
./hooks<br>
./hooks/post-checkout<br>
./hooks/post-commit</p>
<p>I already have lean working in Visual Studio Code, but only having difficulty adding mathlib to it. </p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>
<p>[ Update: In desperation, I got it to work by using leanpkg add, then manually copying all the directories to the appropriate subfolder in .elan.  ]</p>

<p>Have you seen, <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/install/project.md" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/install/project.md">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/install/project.md</a> I think this is the recommended way to work with mathlib now, what you have installed is the  mathlib-tools scripts, which include update-mathlib, which when used in a project should save some time, but adding mathlib as a project dependency and running leanpkg add as in the link will download and install mathlib for you for a project.</p>

<p>Thanks. I decided to do it the proper way by reinstalling everything by following the instructions at the above link step-by-step. I managed to install elan, lean again, but VScode again can't find mathlib.</p>
<p>For example, "import topology.basic" gives the error message "file 'topology\basic' not found in the LEAN_PATH" whereas "import init.data.nat" works fine.</p>
<p>The weird thing is that in the "my_project" directory, I could find all the lean and olean files, but somehow VScode can't read them.</p>

<p>To be clear in your my_project do you have a folder <code>_target/deps/mathlib/src/</code> with the mathlib files in? Thats how leanpkg add should leave it set up</p>

<p>Yes, all the lean files are there in the directory, even the olean files.</p>
<p>[ Update: I re-installed the mathlib extension in a separate directory and for some reason it's now working. Thanks for helping me out. ]</p>
