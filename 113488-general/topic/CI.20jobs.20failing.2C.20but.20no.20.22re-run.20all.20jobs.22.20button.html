<p>This afternoon I've had a bunch of CI jobs fail (including the "testing the linter jobs", which seem to only _ever_ fail for spurious reasons).</p>
<p>Unfortunately where there's usually a button that says "re-run all jobs" in the top right, today it just says "cancel workflow", and doesn't seem to have any effect. On some branches I've just remerged master and committed.</p>

<p>I see a "re-run all jobs" at that link now. I think the button changes from "cancel workflow" to "re-run all jobs" when all of the workflows have stopped running?</p>
