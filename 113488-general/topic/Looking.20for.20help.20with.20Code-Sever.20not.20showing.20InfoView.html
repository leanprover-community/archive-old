<p>I am learning lean via using Code-Server; however, the Lean Infoview doesn’t seem to show anything. Does anyone have any ideas as to why this may be?</p>

<p>I am experiencing the same problem. I was trying to set-up a local Cocalc (docker) with its VS Code Server to make it easier for students to join in, I got stuck at exactly this.</p>

<p>Do you all have some more precise steps to reproduce this? I just installed code-server and added the vscode plugin and from my local machine (i.e. code server on 127.0.0.1:8080 the infoview works fine</p>

<p>1) Get cocalc-docker<br>
2) From the docker shell (root), do <code>mv /usr/local/bin/lean to /usr/local/bin/lean_orig</code><br>
3) Also get extra stuff <code>sudo apt install git curl python3 python3-pip python3-venv</code><br>
4) From a new project (now as user) run <code>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh</code><br>
5) Finally, run</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">python3</span> <span class="bp">-</span><span class="n">m</span> <span class="n">pip</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="c1">--user pipx</span>

<span class="n">pipx</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">mathlibtools</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This would be the set-up. From there, this user can do <code>leanproject get tutorials</code>, and then File / New / VSCode server. This opens a new tab in the browser with code-server running. You can add the lean extension as usual, and open the tutorials folder. All goes as planned, but Infoview doesn't work.</p>

<p>Probably <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="116034">@William Stein</span> would have something to say about what to do here (I don't have right now a paid <a href="http://Cocalc.com">Cocalc.com</a> account, so there is no way to try this in it...).

<p>Unfortunately, I don't have much to say.  Maybe check the Chrome dev tools, e.g., is there are failed network request?   Also, what happens if you try to use Cocalc's own lean editor in this example -- does it also not work?</p>

<p>If you direct message a project id to me (or send a support request) I can upgrade it so you can test on <a href="http://cocalc.com">cocalc.com</a> if you want...  though the above steps aren't something you can do on <a href="http://cocalc.com">cocalc.com</a>, exactly.    You can install cocalc-docker on your laptop though...</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="127136">@Alex J. Best</span>  Could you try your luck with Chromium and see if you observe the same problem?</p>

<p>I'm trying again on my laptop and I just read <a href="https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc-docker#you-cannot-use-chrome-or-safari-you-must-use-firefox">https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc-docker#you-cannot-use-chrome-or-safari-you-must-use-firefox</a> which certainly implies using chrome is less well supported by cocalc-docker</p>

<p>Yeah i really think this is a security problem with localhost not having a valid https certificate and chrome not liking that. What are you actually trying to do <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="254058">@Marc Masdeu</span> ? If you want to host a local (university) server students can play on, can you host it on a site with a https certificate (idk what that actually entails) rather than your localhost?</p>

<p>even though that url looks to load fine, once you convince chromium to let you access localhost despite it not having a valid certificate</p>

<p>Thanks for looking into this. Indeed, my department has some computer to play with, and we want students to use it to play with Lean easily. We will eventually host it with a https certificate (if we manage to do it through docker). It's possible that you can trick chrome to accept these kind of certificates when you access a site, but not when the browser access this site through whatever tricks code-server uses...</p>

<p>I am curious about the current status. </p>
<p>Originally I had code-server running on an arm64 raspberry pi and was sshing via my iPad to use it. The infoview was missing. I have since switched to a x86 vm with gcloud where I have no issue. </p>
<p>Do these issues exist for a bare code-server install? </p>
<p>If you are exposing it, it is probably simplest to put it behind a reverse proxy using caddy + let's encrypt. I did this in the past and it worked quite well. I never had a problem (beyond the PWA experience on the iPad and the built in pdf viewer for the latex workshop extension).</p>
