<p>In the Lean Tutorial  (<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/tutorials">https://github.com/leanprover-community/tutorials</a>) problem <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/0011">#0011</a>,  I was unable to prove that <code>(a b : ℝ) (ha : 0 ≤ a) (hb : 0 ≤ b) : 0 ≤ a + b</code> without using the transitive property of <code>≤</code>. Am I missing something?</p>
<p>If there isn't another way that I simply failed to see, then in my opinion, the user should either be explicitly given the transitive property as something to <code>apply</code> or be told that it is valid to chain expressions together with <code>≤</code> as in</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">calc</span> <span class="n">expr1</span> <span class="bp">≤</span> <span class="n">expr2</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">proof12</span>
<span class="bp">...</span> <span class="bp">≤</span> <span class="n">expr3</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">proof23</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>to get a final inequality <code>expr1 ≤ expr3</code>. Does anyone have thoughts?</p>

<p>I don't think it says anywhere that you shouldn't use transitivity</p>

<p>Yes, but for newcomers I think it would be helpful to say explicitly that <code>calc ...</code> can be used in that way (thus far it had only been used for a equality or single inequality. Just a suggestion</p>

<p>AFAICT it is already stated in the docs of <code>calc</code> mode <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/extras/calc.html">https://leanprover-community.github.io/extras/calc.html</a></p>

<p>Ah, thank you, that's good to know. I had not read that far into the docs before starting the tutorial.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="373999">@Miles</span> , I'd like to understand what you understood here. Chain equalities and inequalities is the only purpose of <code>calc</code>. What did you think <code>calc</code> was doing? I'm asking because I'll resume teaching using this material in two weeks.</p>

<p>For context, I was coming to this tutorial from the natural number game, where it seems nothing could be taken for granted. I had proved that <code>a ≤ a + b</code> (and <code>ha</code> tells us that <code>0 ≤ a</code>), but I did not believe that we had proven transitivity of <code>≤</code>. Transitivity of equality is essentially given to us by the <code>rw</code> tactic, so chain equality of <code>calc</code> (which was explicitly demonstrated in file 01, line 97) seems like just a simplification of multiple uses of <code>rw</code>. Since we hadn't proven or been told anywhere that <code>≤</code> is transitive, I didn't think that was a fact we could assume that <code>calc</code> would do. It would have helped me to be told explicitly in the comments that <code>calc</code> can have more than one <code>≤</code> in its chain and remain valid (i.e. that <code>≤</code> is transitive). I hope that helps clarify my thinking. I'm happy to share more if it doesn't. Thanks</p>
