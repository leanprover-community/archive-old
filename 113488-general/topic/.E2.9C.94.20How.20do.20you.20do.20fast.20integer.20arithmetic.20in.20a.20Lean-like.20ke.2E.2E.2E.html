<p>There are two issues, right?  Issue 1 is that we want access to the speed and power of, say, x86 processors (with efficient arithmetic operations on fixed sized integers and efficient array storage).  Issue 2 is that we want nice mathematical definitions (like the unary definition of natural numbers), but we want fast algorithms for computing these definitions.  Right?</p>

<p>So Mario's sweet spot would address a good part of issue 1 since you would now be able to do fast computations on words of size 64 using built in machine operations (like 64-bit integer addition), right?  It would then be possible to implement fast algorithms on standard mathematical objects using those operations which the kernel would trust.  (I guess it wouldn't be that unsafe to extend this to arrays of various fixed sizes too, right?)  Further, with what Mario are doing in say, MM0, one could prove that a particular machine code implementation of the kernel implements the operations according to the specification and that these implementations would give the same result as more purely type theoretic definitions?</p>

<p>As for the other issue, there are two general options.  In option A, you are transparent about everything.  So <code>+</code> just means the usual unary addition operator, and if you want a fast addition operator, you use either use a different function or wrap your term in some norm_num thing which reduces it in a more efficient manner.   Option B is that you do this non-transparently, so that + looks like unary addition in proofs, but behaves like fast addition in algorithms, tactics, and reduction of type expressions.  I guess there are then two more sub-options to B:  In Option B1, the kernel has a way to justify these replacements, where one has to prove that the replacement algorithm is an equivalent function.  The other option B2: the swap happens without a kernel-level justification.  So either there are only a few built-in "safe" swaps (like Lean 4 and bignum), or swaps only happen for execution of algorithms and not proofs or type checking (like Lean's FFI).</p>

<p>The current implementation of lean 4 puts GMP in the trusted computing base, which not everyone is comfortable with. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to add a data point here, culturally in mathematics it now seems to be completely acceptable to claim that you have proved a theorem even if your proof uses unverified computer calculations. For example Helfgott's proof of weak Goldbach essentially uses <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3062">this work</a>. All the claims in the introduction of that paper saying that various things have been "showed" or "numerically verified" mean "showed using unverified software". So I think that at least as far as working mathematicians are concerned, adding GMP to the trusted computing base is not a big deal. I can completely appreciate that there might be some other people who are less comfortable with this, however I wonder how many of these people actually use big integers in their work.</p>

<p>Of course, you get used to the level of rigor of your environment. If you are doing paper mathematics, then the level of rigor of regular paper proofs seems fine. If you are doing experimental or computational mathematics where everyone in your field uses GAP / Sage / Mathematica, then this also seems fine, because it's what the experts in your area are doing. If you are doing formal verification, then those other methods aren't fine anymore and the gold standard is to push a proof through the kernel. And even between different systems people might have different palates for the complexity of the kernel, driven largely by how complex the one they happen to use is.</p>
<p>It's even possible to be in more than one of these camps at the same time. I wear a lot of hats, and my level of paranoia adapts to the context under discussion. I don't even think I am unique in doing so. This is just how human communication works. But it does tend to desensitize you to potential areas of improvement, and I think this is one of the reasons why things like formal verification are slow to catch on, because maths seems to be doing just fine without our help.</p>

<p>Here is another point of view about theorem prover kernels.  Because of the trustworthiness of theorem proving kernels, we can say statements like "If the kernel accepts it, it is a valid proof", "one can't prove false", "one can be absolutely certain there is no mistake", etc.  I've seen people when they hear those statements get defensive and say "all software has bugs" and treat it like a challenge.  It's hard to convince them that the kernel really is trustworthy.  Every new feature added to the kernel creates the possibility for a soundness bug and makes it harder to say this convincingly, and if nothing else that is an embarrassment.  I think Leo is very proud to say there has never been a soundness bug in Lean 3.  But for Lean 4, already this GMP stuff introduced a <a href="#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/Contradiction.3F">very very short lived soundness bug involving <code>% 0</code></a> in a beta nightly version which was fixed immediately and now makes that statement a bit harder to say for Lean4 without at least a few qualifiers.  (If this statement is somehow not accurate, I'll remove it.)</p>

<p>We know from experience in theorem proving that even if there is a bug in the kernel it is likely not too serious, since the human entering the code has good intent (and at least for formalizing published math, there is already a lot of trust that the math is correct).   But as we introduce more automated proof tools, including AI and brute force search (a la four color theorem and Kepler conjecture proofs), then it is more possible for soundness bugs to be exploited (and go unnoticed).</p>

<p>For the record, I support what Leo is doing with GMP and Lean4, but I also support brainstorming alternative proposals like Mario's which try to move the bar closer to trustworthiness.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the Lean 4 is not officially released yet and the nightly is very bleeding edge and thus has weaker guarantees. I imagine by the time Lean 4 proper releases it will have been more rigorously tested and verified so the situation will be more like Lean 3.</p>
