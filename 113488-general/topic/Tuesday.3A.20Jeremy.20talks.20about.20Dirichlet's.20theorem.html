<p>I've just received this and I haven't seen this posted here yet.  I'm not sure if the talk mentions Lean at any point, but maybe you'll find it interesting nevertheless.</p>
<hr>
<p>As coorganizers, Sneha and I would like to extend our warmest invitation to you all for our next (eighth) talk in the Mathematics Seminar Series on September 1, 2020, Tuesday from 17:30 to 18:30 hours IST. Our speaker for this talk is Prof. Jeremy Avigad who is Professor of Philosophy with an appointment in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University, United States. His talk is titled "The History of Dirichlet’s Theorem on Primes in an Arithmetic Progression”. It is my understanding that Prof. Avigad will touch upon both mathematical and philosophical aspects of this important number theory theorem. Please find the talk's abstract and a brief bio of Jeremy Avigad is in the poster below. Finally, for the sake of drumming some further interest (!), next below are the two articles referenced in his bio.</p>

<p>"Principia. Is it possible that, in the new millennium, the mathematical method is no longer fundamental to philosophy?":<br>

<p>Looking forward to seeing you all on Tuesday, and I’m really excited about this talk! Stay safe, stay sane!</p>

<p>The talk won't have anything to do with Lean (except to the extent that everything has something to do with Lean), but it's a nice story about 19th century mathematics. Be careful, IST is between most time zones; for example, I'll be lecturing at 8am EST.</p>

<p>Thanks for pointing this out!  I thought IST referred to something completely different than a timezone...</p>
