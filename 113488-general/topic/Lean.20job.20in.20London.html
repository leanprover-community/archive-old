<p>So the COVID19 issue has made it complicated to get admin done, and my job ad is still not out :-(</p>
<p>But basically, at some point in the near future, virus willing, I will be advertising for a three year post-doc position, salary £45000 per year, and the ad will look something like this:</p>
<hr>
<p>Job Summary</p>
<p>Applications are invited for a Research Associate position in the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London.  The position is funded by Imperial College’s Excellence Fund for Frontier Research and will involve teaching various aspects of modern research arithmetic geometry to the Lean Theorem Prover.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities</p>
<p>The project will involve working closely with Professor Kevin Buzzard and the number theory group at Imperial College, and will involve formalising some of the ideas in one or more of the following topics: de Jong’s Stacks Project, the theory of etale cohomology, the Langlands Program (and in particular formalisations of the statements of the main theorems and conjectures), class field theory and arithmetic duality, Scholze’s theory of perfectoid spaces, Lurie’s theory of infinity categories, the Clausen/Scholze theory of condensed sets.</p>
<p>Essential Requirements</p>
<p>The essential requirements for this post are as follow:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>• A PhD or equivalent level of professional qualifications and/or experience in either algebraic number theory or formal proof verification.
• Knowledge of, or evidence that you can quickly learn about, some of the basic tools of modern algebraic number theory.
• Knowledge of, or evidence that you can quickly learn about, formalising pure mathematics in the Lean Theorem Prover.
• Ability to carry out original research and to produce published research papers.
• Ability to identify, develop and apply new concepts, techniques and methods.
• Ability to organise and prioritise own work with minimal supervision.
• Ability to prioritise own work in response to deadlines.
• Ability to communicate complex information clearly
</pre></div>


<hr>
<p>When it's actually in some published form I'll circulate it in the normal way, but I thought I should flag that this is, hopefully, coming soon. Start date 1st October 2020 or perhaps later, if things are still weird.</p>

<p>That sounds like a cool job :) As it happen, my CMU contract will be over by then. Any chance you'd consider a computer scientist for the job?</p>

<p>You'll be working with me, my other post-doc, my PhD student, and a bunch of undergraduates.</p>
<p>The start date has to be before July 31st and there is 18 months of funding. I am not sure that the grant will cover the higher range of the salary being advertised in the advert, but I thought that the sooner I mentioned the ad the better.</p>
