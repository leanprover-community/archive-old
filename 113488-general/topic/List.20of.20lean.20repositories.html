<p>At <a href="http://bim.shef.ac.uk/lean" target="_blank" title="http://bim.shef.ac.uk/lean">bim.shef.ac.uk/lean</a> I have placed a list of the 293 github repositories using Lean, which may be of interest.  I have code to update it automatically using the github API, and at some point I will schedule that to run regularly.  By hand I have divided the repositories into crude categories: maths, computer science, teaching, infrastructure, obsolete and scratch space.  There are various extensions that one could think of:<br>
1. One could attach comments to the list.  I have a very basic framework for that but have not used it yet.<br>
2. One could attach more structured metadata, such as codes from the Mathematics Subject Classification, links to relevant papers in the arxiv or pages on Wikipedia etc<br>
3. One could automatically clone everything and attempt to build it.  Probably lots of builds would fail.<br>
4. One could build an unintelligent text-based search engine.<br>
5. One could ask Lean to parse everything and build a more intelligent search engine based on the parse tree.  I don't know how to ask Lean to give me the parse tree.  I don't know whether there is code that can be stolen from the VS Code extension to help with this.<br>
6. One could try to convert the Lean code to HTML with syntax highlighting and  links, as with coqdoc.  Again, I do not know whether there is existing code that  could help with that.</p>

<p>Nice - perhaps a good idea to create a repo for people to contribute features like the 1-6 on your list?</p>
