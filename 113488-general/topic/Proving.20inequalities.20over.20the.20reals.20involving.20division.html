<p>Is there a tactic that will automatically solve the following goal? <a href="/user_uploads/3121/Ztoebuk8R6cfbwUDUce84ACF/image.png">image.png</a>  <br>
<code>linarith</code> doesn't work because, well, the inequality isn't remotely linear. I'm hoping I don't have to do this manually...</p>

<p>Have you tried <code>nlinarith</code>? That should be enough here.</p>

<p>I realized the manual proof wouldn't be as bad as I feared (I had structured things earlier so that this would happen and forgotten about it) but I'd still like a magic tactic</p>

<p>If you clear the denominators it becomes linear right? So if you first show c is nonzero then use <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#field_simp">tactic#field_simp</a> (or manually clear denominators) you might get to something linarith will work on</p>

<p>won't you have a c^2 term if you just clear denominators?</p>

<p>the last term in the product on the right hand side is a 1 - c, and clearing denominators will multiply this by c</p>
