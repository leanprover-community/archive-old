<p>Has anyone looked into using Blockly for Lean? I tried searching for it here but couldn't find anything. It's for building visual program editors, similar to Scratch: <a href="https://developers.google.com/blockly">https://developers.google.com/blockly</a></p>

<p>Why?  It looks like the type of programming you do with really little children.  I'm not sure lean is at the right level for that?</p>

<p>I think this may be good for getting people that are very-not-technically inclined to get their feet wet, but most of the development energy here is in trying to get research mathematicians to become power users</p>

<p>I've heard from friends who don't know Lean that it seems like a "write-only language," which I find amusing. Perhaps if developed, it could be used for high school geometry? They tend to like to tell high schoolers to do those two-column proofs using properties of Euclidean geometry</p>

<p>Sure, but I wouldn't compare Lean to those languages. It's not as easy to pick up as some of the languages you listed, but it theoretically could be with a graphical interface. I'm just skeptical as to whether Blockly would be good for that purpose</p>

<p>I definitely romanticize the idea that we could one day have a beautiful graphical interface for Lean, where math proofs would be visual and intuitive for someone at the high school level, but we're admittedly a long ways away from something like that</p>

<p>I think if you want to teach proofs graphically, you could make a graphical block gluing tool with a pretty interface.  You could use Lean as a backend or really write your own back end.  I don't think there is something special about Lean here. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="284844">@Michael Beeson</span> a long time ago wrote a GUI Calculus theorem prover for students which didn't let them make mistakes. <a href="http://www.helpwithmath.com">http://www.helpwithmath.com</a></p>

<p>That also reminds me,  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110865">@Jeremy Avigad</span> once used some graphical propositional logic tool to teach an intro to proofs class.</p>

<p>I wonder if <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="121918">@Edward Ayers</span> widgets could be leveraged to make a basic version of one of these games in vscode. There was also that cabbage goat wolf thread a long time ago, let me find it.<br>

<p>I think if you are implementing basic stuff in Lean, you could do that with the lean server which wouldn't be hard.  The hard part would be the graphical stuff.  (See <a href="#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Examples.20of.20communicating.20with.20Lean">this thread from today</a> for how to interact with Lean programmatically.)</p>

<p>I have given many high school talks about the natural numbers and Lean, but induction is not something taught until very late on, so I give the proof of 2+2=4 instead. In fact I had a massive gig in March where I was going to prove 2+2=4 to 250 high schoolers but it got cancelled because of lockdown :-( . I just have it in my head that only the brightest schoolkids would understand induction. I think Euclidean geometry might be a nicer way to introduce Lean to schoolkids, but I have never really thought about it because it would require some graphical UI to be good, and I strongly suspect that there are other systems which can already do this.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="127136">@Alex J. Best</span> this is absolutely a use case of widgets. you could write the whole thing in lean without changing any C++. There are still some features for widgets that are missing like drag and drop though but this was the kind of thing I had in mind.</p>

<p>The main problem is saving state. At the moment widgets let you 'save state' by returning a string which is put in to the proof document.<br>
But doing this with some graphical structure would look bloaty.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="115715">@Jason Rute</span> I think you have in mind <em>Tarski's World</em> (<a href="https://www.gradegrinder.net/Products/tw-index.html">https://www.gradegrinder.net/Products/tw-index.html</a>), which is a great tool for teaching students how to read and write expressions in first-order logic. The exercises are fun. For example, you can give students a list of sentences describing a blocks world ("there is a large tetrahedron to the left of a small cube"), and they have build the world graphically and click a button to see if they got it right. They also have software called <em>Turing's World</em>, which lets students build and run Turing machines.</p>
<p>But these are not about teaching proof. They also have a system for that: <a href="https://www.gradegrinder.net/Products/lpl-index.html">https://www.gradegrinder.net/Products/lpl-index.html</a>. I have never used it, but I would be interested in hearing if anyone has had experience with it. It is probably subject to Kevin's objections to e.g. <em>TPIL</em> and <em>Logic and Proof</em> that there is too much emphasis on the logical manipulations, which good mathematics students tend to pick up intuitively, rather than the mathematical content. He has a point: we don't want to convey the impression that proof is only about messing around with ands and ors, it is about drawing substantive conclusions about what follows from what. </p>
<p>Teaching proof with software is hard: a proof is an argument, so you want a fun way for students to construct arguments and get feedback. NNG and friends are probably close to optimal for that. Or something like the <em>Naproche</em> examples, where you pick a restricted domain with a manageable number of definitions and assumptions, write proofs as sequences of statements, and have a first-order theorem prover fill in the rest.</p>
<p>A number of years ago, John Mumma, Ed Dean, and I specified a formal system that allows you to write proofs in elementary geometry much the way you find them in Euclid's <em>Elements</em>. (<a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/Papers/formal_system_for_euclids_elements.pdf">http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/Papers/formal_system_for_euclids_elements.pdf</a>) I think it should be possible to implement it, so that students could write proofs in geometry ("Let D be the point bisecting AB. Then AD ~ DB. ..") and have them checked automatically, which a little green check whenever a line is sufficiently justified. In a recent paper, Michael Beeson and co-authors gave us flak for the fact that it hasn't been implemented (they were formalizing geometry in Coq), but I still have hopes of doing it in Lean 4 one day, with nice syntax for writing geometric proofs and interpreting them (in the background) as statements about the Euclidean plane.</p>
