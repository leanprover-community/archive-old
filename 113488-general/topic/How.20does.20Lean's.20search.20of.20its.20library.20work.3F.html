<p>I'm experimenting with a visual language of nodes and arrows so "search" naturally becomes subgraph isomorphism search that is variable-substitution aware.  However, this made me wonder how does Lean match a user's text input to a library rule's input parameters?  If it even does that or needs to do that.  See my idea is that the library should always be searching as my user's graph input changes so that the "Apply rule" buttons automatically show up and the user just clicks one to logically transform their diagram.  I'm pretty certain Lean has some tools that do a search for applicable rules, from what I've read here in the past.  So how if negative on the above, then how do these community plugins perform their searching?</p>

<p>Thanks Scott.<br>
I use that same link to the Wikipedia article on Unification often with work related to Prolog.  <br>
The article notes a few types of unification but for Prolog is is specifically the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_(computer_science)#Syntactic_unification_of_first-order_terms">syntactic unification</a> that matters.</p>
<p>For lean can someone identify which unification it is using? It would also be helpful is one could identify in the GitHub repository where the unification code is? I find references to <code>unification hint</code> but nothing that jumps out at me that says I do unification.</p>

<p>A side question maybe that is easy for someone here to answer is how does one mix category theory with unification?  The wikipedia article talks about solving systems over some algebraic structure possibly with some functions, what if your terms consist of diagrams.  Would this definitely be called graph unification?</p>

<p>This might be where unification happens: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/blob/master/src/library/type_context.cpp">https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/blob/master/src/library/type_context.cpp</a> (<code>is_def_eq_core</code> it seems)</p>
<p>It's fairly complicated, but approximately speaking it compares two terms piece-by-piece (terms are represented as DAGs I believe), and whenever a metavariable is compared with something, that metavariable is replaced with what it is being compared to, assuming the occurs check succeeds.  By "replaced" I mean the metavariable is assigned the term in the metavariable context, but it's as if every instance of the metavariable is replaced with the term.</p>
<p>There are additional complications from (1) the fact that you might need to reduce terms a bit to see that they can be successfully unified, (2) the fact unification hints might need to be consulted to help with unification, and (3) other heuristics to help the unifier along.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="236489">@Daniel Donnelly</span> I don't know too much about these internal details, and someone who actually knows something can correct me -- I'm just reading source code.  The <code>library_search</code> tactic uses <code>tactic.get_env</code> to get the current "environment," which contains everything that's been declared (lemmas, definitions, and notation) and then uses <code>tactic.suggest.match_head_symbol</code> to figure out which lemmas from the environment might apply to the current goal (there are many many lemmas, so this is an optimization).  For each of these potential lemmas, <code>tactic.suggest.apply_and_solve</code> uses <code>tactic.apply</code> (which is what <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#apply">tactic#apply</a> uses) to see if it can be applied.  This uses a Lean-internal function, written in C++ for speed, to try to unify the lemma with the goal, while instantiating arguments with metavariables.</p>

<p>For a simple example of how apply works:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">lemma</span> <span class="n">foo</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="bp">∀</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">ℕ</span><span class="o">),</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="bp">≤</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">zero_le</span>

<span class="kd">example</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">ℕ</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="bp">≤</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">:=</span>
<span class="kd">begin</span>
  <span class="n">apply</span> <span class="n">foo</span><span class="o">,</span>
<span class="kd">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I think it roughly works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lean tries and quickly fails to unify the type of <code>foo</code> with <code>0 ≤ n</code>.</li>
<li>Lean creates a metavariable <code>?m_1</code> and constructs the expression <code>foo ?m_1</code>, which has the type <code>0 ≤ ?m_1</code>.</li>
<li>Lean tries to unify this with <code>0 ≤ n</code>, and it succeeds with the solution <code>?m_1 =?= n</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>(I suspect though that it actually tries step 2 first, and it would fall back to step 1 if it fails.)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="306601">@Kyle Miller</span>  So my question now becomes how is the environment represented as a data structure (?).  Surely it isn't a simply a list, and can be searched a lot quicker if it were some more appropriate data structure for searching.</p>

<p>The environment seems to be written in C++, but the interface on the Lean side is essentially just a list. (It has a slight optimization that it exposes a <code>fold</code> operation, so it doesn't have to convert the list of declarations to a Lean <code>list</code> when you want to access it.)</p>

<p>I caution that since you are asking very technical questions that it is good to be specific.  How the parser works is fairly complicated. I don’t think library search works on the same idea as the parser and elaborator since in library search you have to match an expression to a theorem expression via unification.  I don’t think (but am not sure) that there is any helpful indexing of theorems in Lean 3 that might significantly speed up library search.  I believe it is a linear search.  (I could be wrong here.)  I think that (more than language of implementation) is the speed issue.</p>

<p>I do think the names of constants in the environment are indexed which makes their lookup in the parser faster.</p>

<p>Yes <code>library_search</code> is just a linear search over the entire environment. We do a tiny bit of filtering (only selecting declarations in the environment with a "head symbol" which matches the goal), but in the end <code>apply</code> is so incredibly fast (in particular, it fails fast) that mostly it is better to just hand everything over to it.</p>

<p>Is that filter based on an index (like a hash map) or do you just skip <code>apply</code> if the head symbol is wrong?</p>

<p>So we just do a <code>filter</code> on the environment, checking the head symbol, and then a <code>map</code> trying to actually <code>apply</code> the declaration against the current goal.</p>

<p>(I was shocked when I first tried it out that an approach as dumb as that was actually viable. Unfortunately mathlib is large enough now that deep in the import hierarchy <code>library_search</code> becomes too slow to be usable.)</p>

<p>Yes, so it's O(n f(n)) but needs to be O((log n) f(n)) where n is the library size, and f(n) is the running time of whatever needs be done at each item in the library.   I'm wondering if my code will be any faster since it has to do a subgraph isomorphism search (brute force would be) for each subgraph of the user's drawn graph,  try and match a graphical rule input graph (in the library) to that subgraph, and then do any additonal checks needed that are not handled by the subgraph search.</p>
<p>Reason for graphs, is that is the natural format of my visual language.  There is a Node &amp; Arrow class, and they're connected by pointers/references.  So there is naturally a graph, not pure textual format to the language.</p>

<p>Again, to be specific, is what you are doing the same thing as library search?  Matching a goal e.g. <code>x y : nat |- x + y = y + x</code> to a theorem in the library?  If you have a constant library of theorems I think there are known ways to do this efficiently.  The problem is that the Lean environment is constantly changing and so is the list of theorems in the environment.  Again, I think this is being addressed in Lean 4, but I don’t know the details.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="115715">@Jason Rute</span>  What I'm doing is matching the user's input math (they can draw whatever graph they want) to an rule input in the library, so instead of the user entering in all of tha line: <code>x y : nat |- x + y = ...</code> they would just enter in say <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> as two nodes within a parent node <code>nat</code> and the library will suggest the theorem by its input arguments from the library.  But the user could also just enter in the whole theorem and that would also match the whole theorem.  Essentially any labeled math graph that the user enters is a valid query, but may not be mathematically valid under the library's current collection of definitions.  Say if the user enters in <code>f: A -&gt; B</code> but also <code>f:C -&gt; D</code> and <code>A != C</code>.  Entering that should highlight parts of their graph with error color.</p>
