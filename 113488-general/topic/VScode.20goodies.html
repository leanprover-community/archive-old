<p>Would it be possible to configure a hotkey in VScode that grabs the first output from <code>suggest</code> and prepends/replaces the <code>suggest</code> that generated it?</p>

<p>Bonus points if the replace/prepending is automatically chosen depending on whether the suggestion is an <code>exact</code>/<code>refine</code></p>

<p>This should be possible with some ugly tactic state parsing hacks, but I wonder if there might be a better way to do this using a hole command.</p>

<p>Globally there is a big need for more structured tactic state information. Currently the Lean server returns tactic state as a single string that you see in the Lean message panel in VScode. Even syntax highlighting there is based on a hack. It would be really nice to see this changing in Lean 4, but I don't know what are the plans here.</p>

<p>Even hovering on <em>notation</em> in the tactic state to see the keyboard shortcut would be useful! But it would be much better for definitions because sometimes they're much harder to cut and paste into something syntactically valid in a .lean file (especially if you're in the middle of something else)</p>

<p>I think I can see how to implement this for the VS Code extension (but no ETA promise). It will require implementing some custom tooltip functionality for the info view; we can't reuse VS Code's built-in "hover provider". </p>

<p>Another possibility is to use hashing to avoid recomputing things that haven't changed.</p>

<p>but it is definitely less ergonomic than the lean / isabelle "dynamic document" style, which puts more strain on the system to keep things in sync but has an easy mental model</p>

<p>In Lean4, the state at the end of each line in a tactic block will be stored, right, so that you get the best of both worlds (no need to recompile the beginning of a proof if you just change the last line)?</p>

<p>that's fine if you detect that nothing was changed, yes!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it's not clear to me how to improve LSP to support our use case better though</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can easily add custom commands to LSP.  I would expect that an LSP server for Lean offers a command to get the goal state at any position in the file.  Then we can roll the info view as usual.  I'm not sure if our (comparatively) niche use case is worth standardizing.  It might even be desirable to roll it ourselves to facilitate experimentation.</p>

<p>It might be nice to standardize the LSP extension across theorem provers though, so that the LSP client can stay relatively generic; otherwise it's not buying much over the original situation</p>

<p>In Coq the proof state doesn't reflect the state of where your cursor is, but the point up to some "checkpoint".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The absence of Coq's iron curtain going up and down in your file is one of the first things I noticed when I used Lean for the first time. Maybe it was even before I noticed unicode. It really feels like absolute freedom to use a proof assistant that way, even after using Coq only for a couple of weeks.</p>
