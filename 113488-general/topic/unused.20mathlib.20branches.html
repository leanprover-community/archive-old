<p>The mathlib repo has 228 branches right now. This isn't really an issue, but there are minor costs to having unneeded branches around: it makes the repo slightly bigger, and makes us store useless olean caches on Azure.</p>
<p>So just a general FYI/request: if you have branches (<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/branches">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/branches</a>) that you know will never be used again, consider deleting them, if only for the sake of tidiness!</p>

<p>mathlib now has 341 branches, so time for another request! If you have a minute to spare, look over this link and delete some branches that you know you won't be using anymore.</p>

<p>That's fine, the cost of a branch is very small. But I can't tell the difference between this and something completely abandoned, which is why I'm asking people to clean up after themselves :)</p>

<p>It's probably a good idea to keep copies of these branches locally/on your own fork, just in case.</p>
