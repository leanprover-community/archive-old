<p>Anyone familiar with the SSProve framework/similar efforts to formalise game-based and simulation-based cryptographic proof? If you are, do you know much about whether porting it to Lean would be possible, or even useful? A lot of this work only exists in Coq currently.</p>

<p>I don't know much about these frameworks (yet!) but I definitely think it would be interesting to have something like that in Lean.</p>

<p>I haven't looked at SSP much, the main reason for FCF style was it seemed to make rewinding algorithms by simulation easier, which was relevant in trying to prove zero knowledge proofs and signatures are secure.</p>

<p>I'm also interested in formalization of cryptography, and it's partially why I have been working on a complexity theory PR (<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/11046">#11046</a>). If you're not already aware, there are frameworks like EasyCrypt which allow one to carry out cryptographic proofs, but it seems like none of these really connect their frameworks to formalizations to this, and I was little disappointed by that. Do you know if FCF does this?</p>

<p>Yes. Generally theorems in cryptography are stated in terms of existence or nonexistence of polynomial time algorithms for doing certain tasks, and polynomial time algorithms are usually defined in terms of the number of Turing machine steps it takes to solve a problem. But I don't think any of these frameworks prove, for example, that a composition of two polynomial-time functions is polynomial time.</p>

<p>The thing that SSProve does is that it implements a recent framework for properly compositional proofs - using some kinda cool monadic stuff. A port of SSProve into Lean would be highly desirable IMO... currently it only exists in Coq. But I think we probably have all the tools you'd need - it's just a matter of doing it in a Lean/mathlib ideomatic way.</p>

<p>This is sort-of true, but the simulation-based proofs framework is a little trickier in a sense. I guess it's not quite at the same level of abstraction.</p>

<p>The FCF approach defines polynomial complexity but not necessarily in terms of Turing machines. Algorithms are implemented by extending the lean base language with monads for sampling distributions and oracle access (Although these monads are a lot simpler than the monads in SSProve).</p>
<p>Since algorithms are essentially Lean functions (modulo the binding of the monads), polynomial complexity is just some predicate <code>polynomial_complexity : (A -&gt; B) -&gt; Prop</code> on Lean functions (which then naturally extends to the monad functions). Because of function extensionality, this predicate essentially means "some implementation of this function is polynomial time".</p>
<p>The approach to defining this is to just assume some primitive functions (e.g. <code>id</code> or <code>prod.fst</code>) are polynomial time, and have axioms to for things like "a composition of polynomial time things is polynomial time". Ideally it would be better to have something like "this function is realized by a polynomial time Turing machine", but I'm not sure if that is something the complexity theory in Lean can prove.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The FCF approach defines polynomial complexity but not necessarily in terms of Turing machines. Algorithms are implemented by extending the lean base language with monads for sampling distributions and oracle access (Although these monads are a lot simpler than the monads in SSProve).</p>
<p>Since algorithms are essentially Lean functions (modulo the binding of the monads), polynomial complexity is just some predicate <code>polynomial_complexity : (A -&gt; B) -&gt; Prop</code> on Lean functions (which then naturally extends to the monad functions). Because of function extensionality, this predicate essentially means "some implementation of this function is polynomial time".</p>
<p>The approach to defining this is to just assume some primitive functions (e.g. <code>id</code> or <code>prod.fst</code>) are polynomial time, and have axioms to for things like "a composition of polynomial time things is polynomial time". Ideally it would be better to have something like "this function is realized by a polynomial time Turing machine", but I'm not sure if that is something the complexity theory in Lean can prove.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right, that's what I thought. The "a composition of polynomial time things is polynomial time" proof is what the bulk of the <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/11046">#11046</a> PR is about (using the basis of partially recursive functions, though one could do it with TM's too to be complete). I guess it's not too big a novelty just to carry out the composition proof and attach it to the bottom of a framework like this, but I like the idea of being able to say that we haven't written any code that isn't checked itself by another theorem prover.</p>

<p>The thing that SSProve does is that it implements a recent framework for properly compositional proofs - using some kinda cool monadic stuff. A port of SSProve into Lean would be highly desirable IMO... currently it only exists in Coq. But I think we probably have all the tools you'd need - it's just a matter of doing it in a Lean/mathlib ideomatic way.</p>

<p>Looking at the eprint for SSProve (<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/eprint-bin/getfile.pl?entry=2021/397&amp;version=20210526:113037&amp;file=397.pdf">https://eprint.iacr.org/eprint-bin/getfile.pl?entry=2021/397&amp;version=20210526:113037&amp;file=397.pdf</a>), I think that it seems fairly possible to implement some form of SSProve on top of the foundations given in FCF, which is something the authors mention in the related work section</p>

<p>Reading the FCF comparison in the SSProve paper and that does sound promising. The FCF approach seems more, I don't know - I like it better than the deep embedding of EasyCrypt (honestly while some people really like EC I'm colder on it, but maybe I just need more experience).</p>

<p>Hi all, just out of curiosity, has there been any work done on formalizing what a proof /zero knowledge proof is?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110865">@Jeremy Avigad</span> did some work on verifying computations over finite fields for a blockchain application, not sure if zero knowledge proofs were defined explicitly but I think they feature in the formalization</p>

<p>The formalization is here: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3497775.3503675">https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3497775.3503675</a>. The technology is built on top of the STARK proof protocol, but the protocol does not play a direct role in the formalization. The protocol provides efficient ways of verifying that that proof has/knows solutions to a parameterized family of polynomials, which you can use to encode information, computation, etc. Our formalization starts with a certain family of polynomials, and shows that they encode computation in a particular machine model. (Subsequent work verifies code wrt that machine model.)</p>

<p>You may also be interested in my project <a href="https://github.com/BoltonBailey/formal-snarks-project">formalizing SNARKs</a>, which formalizes the soundness proof of Groth '16 and a few other pairing-based SNARKs.</p>

<p>Sorry to be slow to respond -- I am on a bike trip now -- but no, it hasn't. The original formalization is in a public repository. There is a file, <code>util.lean</code> or something like that, that has a few things that can perhaps go into mathlib.</p>

<p>I was trying to do some work with bitvectors the other day and it's oddly tricky... even using nat.bits has issues. And it's weird that bitvectors don't seem to work nicely with nat.bits...</p>
