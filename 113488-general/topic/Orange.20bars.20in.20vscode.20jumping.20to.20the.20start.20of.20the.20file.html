<p>I'm finding when editing leaf files in mathlib, that sometimes the orange bar jumps right back to the start of the file, and I have to restart lean for it to progress again</p>

<p>After I restart, everything behaves for about 5 minutes, and then it jumps right back to the top of the file again. Given the file takes about 2 minutes to build, this makes working on it extremely frustrating</p>

<p>A quick search shows that multiple features in vscode-lean were implemented with <code>workspace.rootPath</code>, i.e. before you could even open multiple workspaces.</p>

<p>To be clear, this is separate Vscode windows with a different workspace in each.</p>
