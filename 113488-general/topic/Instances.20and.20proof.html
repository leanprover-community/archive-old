<p>If I understand correctly, to prove something in Lean is to find a term of type <code>p</code>, where <code>p</code> is a a term of type <code>Prop</code>. But the type of <code>add_comm_group</code>, for example,  is <code>Type u → Type u</code>. So <code>add_comm_group int</code> is not a term of type <code>Prop</code>. Thus, it is meaningless to talk about 'proving' <code>add_comm_group int</code>.</p>
<p>And yet, constructing a term of type <code>add_comm_group int</code> corresponds to what I think of mathematically as <em>proving</em> that the integers form an additive abelian group. Of course, unlike a term of type <code>Prop</code>, we don't have proof irrelevance. It matters what term of type <code>add_comm_group int</code> I construct as there are many different ways to impose an additive abelian group structure on <code>int</code>.</p>
<p>However, if <code>h : add_comm_group int</code>, then the type of <code>h.add_left_neg</code> does have type <code>Prop</code>. So here is a sense in which <em>something</em> is proved by constructing an instance of a type class.</p>
<p>Is there a standard way to express the proof content of finding an instance of a type class? Can one do this in Lean?</p>

<p>I don't think there is a standard way to do this. But like you said, some fields of <code>add_comm_group</code> have type <code>Type*</code> and others have type <code>Prop</code>. And that's certainly something that Lean can recognize.</p>

<p>So in principal, one could write a <code>meta</code> program, and if you feed it <code>add_comm_group</code>, then it could tell you: these fields are data, and those fields are properties.</p>

<p>But in fact, occasionally <code>lemma foobar : some_type := _</code> is a useful hack, because it switches on a different elaboration mode. In complicated definitions, I've seen the <code>def</code>-mode get hung up on incomplete definitions that still had <code>_</code> or <code>sorry</code> in them. Apparently it's trying to figure out whether or not the whole defn should be <code>noncomputable</code> or not, and it doesn't realize that "oh, I don't care, the user isn't even finished with writing the complete def yet; I'll come back to this question tomorrow"</p>

<p>My experience from UG group theory texts is that they often don't think about the identity and inverses as part of the structure, so if you just wanted something which was a Prop and needed only the addition (which of course is essential and not a Prop, the theorem is that <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi mathvariant="double-struck">Z</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mo>+</mo><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(\mathbb{Z},+)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathbb">Z</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;"></span><span class="mord">+</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span> is a group, even if we informally say <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="double-struck">Z</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Z</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68889em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathbb">Z</span></span></span></span> is a group) then you can do something horrible like</p>

<p>but this is a bit more horrible in DTT because you can't get to z computably (which is fair enough, saying it exists is probably not enough information to find it in general)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> your second definition was similar to what I did when I first tried formalising parts of my introductory pure mathematics course, except that I had the conjunction of <code>zero_add</code> and <code>add_zero</code> as a field. I soon abandoned that approach after realising how nasty it was to work with in Lean.</p>
<p>It's interesting how some statements that seem natural in informal mathematics are cumbersome in Lean (and, presumably, vice versa). In this respect, understanding (say) the group concept in informal mathematics is different to understanding the group concept in Lean.</p>

<p>From an expository point of view, I think it is important to be clear on the distinction between data and proofs, and correspondingly datatypes and propositions). But it is also useful to point out how Lean handles them uniformly by having expressions for both, and even lets you combine them. Finding a group by class inference is a good example -- you are relying on Lean to figure out what the operations are (the data) and also their properties (the proofs). Similarly, the subtype <code>{n // n &gt; 0}</code> is, overall, treated like a data type, but it combines both data and a proof.</p>
<p>You can similarly compare the statements "5 is odd," "there is an odd number," and "there is a unique odd number between 4 and 6." Mathematically, we can produce data from the latter two facts by talking about "some odd number" or "<em>the</em> unique odd number between 4 and 6." Lean can do that too, and I wouldn't too much of a big deal about the distinction here. Both ways of talking about groups are common in the informal literature. It's just that sooner or later we have to talk about "the inverse" and introduce names for it, and if you were coding up a symbolic algebra package you want to provide code to compute inverses. </p>
<p>Overall, I think it is important not to make things more confusing than they are. Talk about the different representations of groups in ordinary mathematical terms, make sure students are clear about that the differences are (and why they are mathematically irrelevant), and then talk about how you could represent them in Lean and why one way might be better than another.</p>

<p>I wonder if this example of <code>zero_add</code> with its existential quantifier is just a Lean problem -- even in math, algebraic theories seem to be best as equations with free variables, i.e. universally quantified equalities. (I might be biased toward preferring when things can be defined using commutative diagrams.)</p>

<p>I think it's not Lean-related at all. Especially, trying to define groups without putting the neutral element in the definition is simply cumbersome. Just look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)#Definition">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)#Definition</a>. This is a <em>mess</em> featuring a uniqueness claim stuck in the middle of the definition after the second axiom and used in the third axiom. It is <em>much</em> cleaner to put <code>e</code> (and the inversion function) in the package from the beginning and then state that any <code>e'</code> which is also neutral equals <code>e</code>.</p>

<p>It just means you have to put the quantifiers in the right order, which means presenting it as a flat list of axioms doesn't work. Incidentally, metamath uses this approach: <a href="http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/df-mnd.html">df-mnd</a></p>

<p>Once the predicate of being a monoid is defined, you can define a function returning "the identity element" and restate the axioms to talk about it, so the definition of a group can use that definition, so it doesn't need to also be nested in the same quantifier</p>

<p>but that's not really a disambiguator because both approaches have that theorem in the end. In lean, the real disambiguator is that defeq will hate you if you use choice to extract the identity element, and there is nothing you can do to work around this. This is why even things like <code>gsmul</code> are migrating to fields in lean</p>

<p>I don't follow. Lean is not the source of truth here, mathematics is leading the charge. Lean just made some early design decisions that make certain mathematically equivalent ways of saying this easier than others</p>

<p>(For example, a mathematical proof might say "Suppose there exists a foo <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">x</span></span></span></span> which is bar.

<p>One advantage of that approach is that you get that two monoids with the same carrier and multiplication are equal for free</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does mathlib have the non-free version of this result? <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/monoid.ext">docs#monoid.ext</a> seems not to exist, which is where I'd expect to find it.</p>

<p>Mario, this sounds very interesting, do you have some recommended reading for it?</p>
