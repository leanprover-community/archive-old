<p>Back in ye olden days of Lean 2, there was an option to build Lean with the option <code>-k N</code> or <code>--keep-going N</code>. This would build Lean, and if there were <code>N</code> different files that raised at least one error, then the build would stop.</p>
<p>I think a feature like this would be really useful for the Github Actions. Currently my workflow is</p>
<ul>
<li>Push a probably-broken commit to mathlib</li>
<li>Wait for Github actions to raise an error</li>
<li>Run <code>leanproject get-cache</code> and fix all errors in the file where the error was raised.</li>
<li>Go to step 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>This workflow would speed-up quite a bit if Github actions showed the next 5-10 files with at least one error. The compilation after errors often still runs fine: usually it's a broken proof, and that raises 0 future errors (it might raise warnings of the form <code>imported a file containing 'sorry'</code>). If a definition/instance breaks, there will probably be many unrelated errors.</p>
<p>Would it be possible / desirable to do this?</p>

<p>Maybe a more targeted version of this would be to only stop the build on an error in the main task?</p>

<p>Another idea would be to try to not build a module that imports another module that had an error outside a proof</p>
