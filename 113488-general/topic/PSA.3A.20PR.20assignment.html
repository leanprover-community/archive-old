<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="*">@everyone</span> So far, I've been assigning PRs automatically to maintainers without regards for their availability. I'm going to change that approach and let maintainers pick PRs and only assign PRs if they remain unassigned for a few days. Please don't panic if your PR remains unassigned longer than is usual</p>
