<p>I did it. I upgraded my CPU+motherboard+RAM. Compiling mathlib from scratch at home went from 21 minutes to 10 minutes. Interactive use also feels much better, with orange bars much less annoying. My Lean-friendly CPU is a AMD RYZEN 7 2700X.</p>

<p>That's exactly the one I chose 3 months ago for my new desktop (with 32 GB RAM), and I have been very happy with it since then.</p>

<p>Ummm... how does this work? What do you plug the CPU+motherboard+RAM into?</p>

<p>Nevermind, this is a arcane branch of applied computer science which involves using some sort of physical machine that actually run the software by moving electrons in metallic wires.</p>
