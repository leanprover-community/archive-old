<p>Proving equivalences between <code>degree</code> and <code>nat_degree</code> for polynomials has in my (granted, only a few months of) experience been a cause of great pain--mostly because <code>with_bot ℕ</code> doesn't play well with <code>simp</code> and <code>ring</code>. Yet, what at first glance seems to me to be a benefit of using <code>degree</code>, which is knowing that <code>degree f = 0</code> implies immediately that <code>f ≠ 0</code>, hasn't really come up in proofs about polynomials that I've done. </p>
<p>What if we just removed <code>degree</code> from mathlib? Other than that it would be a huge messy refactor, would there be big drawbacks?</p>

<p>I have the same question. I ~always use nat_degree instead of degree.</p>
