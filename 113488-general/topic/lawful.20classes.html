<p>I'm having a look at the new <code>is_lawful_functor</code>. I just realized that it does not extend <code>functor</code>. That makes some signatures pretty verbose. Is there a plan to make shortcuts like <code>lawful_functor</code> that would combine both?</p>

<p>I think it used to be bundled and was later unbundled. Of course you should ask Sebastian for the full story</p>

<p>I'm not convinced of the useful of such shortcut classes. You cannot have class inference convert both to and from the class without risking cycles, which would make their usage quite clunky, I'd imagine.</p>
