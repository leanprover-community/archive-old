<p>Hi all! I'm trying to extract a simplified AST of a Lean document, ideally using the <code>--server</code> API.  IOW, I'd like to take a document like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">#check</span> <span class="n">nat</span>
<span class="c1">-- comment</span>
<span class="kd">example</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Prop</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">false</span> <span class="bp">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="kd">begin</span> <span class="n">intros</span> <span class="n">H</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">apply</span> <span class="n">false.elim</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="n">H</span> <span class="kd">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>and fragment it like this (where <code>[…]</code> indicates a "fragment"):</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="o">[</span><span class="k">#check</span> <span class="n">nat</span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="c1">-- comment</span>
<span class="o">[</span><span class="kd">example</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Prop</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">false</span> <span class="bp">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">p</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="kd">begin</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">intros</span> <span class="n">H</span><span class="o">],</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">apply</span> <span class="n">false.elim</span><span class="o">],</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="k">from</span> <span class="n">H</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="kd">end</span><span class="o">]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I'm pretty flexible about exactly where the boundaries are, as long as individual tactics are separated from each other.  While I can use the <code>info</code> query to get data at a given point, it doesn't give me the boundaries of each <code>info</code> span.   I could look at <code>widget</code> boundaries returned by <code>info</code>, but each widget only includes a  starting position, not a span.  I guess I could dump the contents of the relevant <code>info_manager</code> on the C++ side, but I'm not sure whether there might be a simpler solution.</p>

<p>My experience is that this is hard. I and others are working on a dataset which does this for proofs, but it required injecting code into lean to get the starts, (you could use the server, but I find it isn’t 100% reliable, and it is really slow).  I also injected other more complicated code in every tactic to get the positions of the parameters.  Finally I wrote a good-enough Lean parser to combine all this data to get the ends of the parameters.  I’d be happy to share the dataset when it is ready for distribution.</p>

<p>Of course I might have overlooked something obvious, so don’t let me stop you if you know what to do.  I didn’t feel comfortable messing with the C++ but it might be the simplest approach in the end.</p>

<p>My hope is that Lean 4 when it comes out is going to store all this nicely in some giant parse tree which can be inspected.  (But that is just a hope, I have no idea what Lean 4 is capable of in this regard.)</p>

<p>AFAICT the way the C++ works for the <code>info</code> query is that it reparses all the way to the point that the query is for, so it would require hooking into the parser.</p>

<p>This sounds very cool!

<p>It would be really great to have something like Alectryon for Lean! But yeah, I suspect it will be a whole lot easier to implement in Lean 4. The closest Lean 3 comparison I know of is <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> 's <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/format_lean/">formatting tool</a> (<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/format_lean">https://github.com/leanprover-community/format_lean</a>), but it doesn't tokenize to the level you're looking for.</p>

<p>The problem with server based approaches like format lean (and I think widgets) is that the lean server only records the start of the tactic and not the end.  Also it doesn’t handle hierarchy and it can ignore the second of adjacent tokens if there is no space between them.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="371318">@Clément</span> I think your work is extremely important. My <code>format_lean</code> project is a quick hack that was good enough for <a href="https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~pmassot/enseignement/math114/">my immediate purpose</a> but I'm fully aware it's not good enough for general purposes. I lack time (and courage) to work on it before the rise of Lean 4 since Lean 4 will open so many possibilities in a much nicer way. But I'm thrilled to see someone doing something for Lean 3. </p>
<p>You can also have a look at how the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/sphere-eversion/blueprint/index.html">sphere eversion blueprint</a> is setup. The main source here is a <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/sphere-eversion/tree/master/blueprint/src">TeX document</a> having a couple of TeX macros referencing Lean declarations (<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/sphere-eversion/blob/master/blueprint/src/loops.tex#L26-L27">example</a>). This is then compiled by <a href="http://plastex.github.io/plastex/">plasTeX</a> and produces things like <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/sphere-eversion/blueprint/chap-loops.html#lem:loop_of_hull">this lemma statement</a> (hover over the Lemma word to see a bunch of icons appearing). But right now the Lean links simply send you to the relevant line on GitHub where things are completely static. plaxTeX also generates the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/sphere-eversion/blueprint/dep_graph.html">dependency graph/progress report</a> but this is a somewhat orthogonal story. Of course I dream of a better integration, although there will never be a one to one correspondence between informal lemmas and the formalization.</p>

<p>If you can identity a C++ hook that would make your life much easier you can ask Gabriel Ebner. He is busy, we are all busy, but he made many dreams come true before. And he is currently the main maintainer of the community fork of Lean 3 (the official version of Lean 3 is completely frozen, for good reasons).</p>

<p>Hi not much more to add to this other than as far as I know there is no api for this and would require digging through the c++ but the tactic boundary information is in there somewhere but I could never figure out how the info request got it exactly.  As mentioned above this will hopefully become really easy in Lean 4.</p>

<p>Thanks all for the great pointers!  Here's what I've got at this point:</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="115715">@Jason Rute</span> your summary is excellent: in particular,  if there's no space after a <code>{</code>, the focused goal list doesn't seem to be available through the --server API.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> <code>format_lean</code> is great — I'm really sad I didn't hear about it two months ago when I was writing the Alectryon paper, it would have a great addition to the related work :/  I'm not sure how robust things can get in Lean3 without patching the C++.  With Lean4, it should be essentially trivial.  I'll get in touch with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110043">@Gabriel Ebner</span> .</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="121918">@Edward Ayers</span> Thanks a lot for confirming that.  Interestingly, it looks like the least-broken heuristic for Lean3 would be to use widget positions + look for specific markers.

<p>It's not true yet because there is no step-through goal display at all yet, so no storage of that information either. But when that is implemented in the language server, it would be sensible to have an API function that compiles a single file, returning not only the Environment but also all metadata held by the elaborator for the language server. Then you should be able to do all this in a relatively short Lean 4 program.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Before I comment on Alectryon for Lean 3, I want to mention <a href="https://github.com/jasonrute/lean_proof_recording">https://github.com/jasonrute/lean_proof_recording</a> which was a big part of the lean-gptf project.  It is currently the only way to fully record Lean 3 tactic proofs, doing both (1) and (2) .  While for that project, we only need the goal and the corresponding tactic, we actually capture a lot more.  We capture the entire tree (sort of an AST) of the tactic proof, taking into account nested tactics.  We also capture position information (begin and end) as well as the tactic parameters.  <em>To be clear, I'm not suggesting you build Alectryon on top of <code>lean_proof_recording</code>.</em>  The latter is much too hacky.  However, it may be helpful for comparison of results and for making mockups of Alectryon for Lean.  It could also be helpful for finding interesting edge cases.  Also, if you can get your proof recording changes into Lean, I might consider rebuilding <code>lean_proof_recording</code> to use those instead of the current Rube Goldberg machine that is <code>lean_proof_recording</code>.</p>

<p>For 1, we propose to bypass the heuristics and make Lean dump its entire internal tables. For 2, we think it should (likely) work to make the parser dump the boundaries of each tactic as it processes a file. This way we get a well-parenthesized interval tree giving the boundaries of each tactic, which we can then use in conjunction with the internal tables to reconstruct the info that Alectryon needs. Then, it's just a matter of feeding that information to Alectryon, which is quite easy.</p>

<p>As for the boundaries, do you know if it is easy to get the end position out of the Lean C++ parser?  I've tried looking (maybe not hard enough, since I'm not fluent in C++) and I am not sure I see where to get it?

<p>Here is a discussion of the different types of Lean tactics you will encounter.  (I'm not as familiar with Coq, so I don't know how many are their as well.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Most tactic commands are made of interactive tactics, like <code>intros a b c</code>.</li>
<li>There are also non-interactive tactics like <code>tactic.swap</code> which may or may not be handled a little differently in the backend.</li>
<li>There are two types of semicolon tactic combinators, e.g. <code>intro; simp; refl</code> and <code>intro; [simp, tidy]</code>.  Note, that the Lean language server uses the first semicolon of the list as the location of the "start position" of the tactic for the purpose of displaying the goal.  (That presented a big pain in <code>lean_proof_recording</code>.)</li>
<li>You can have solve1 tactics which focus on and solve the first goal, e.g. <code>{simp, refl}</code>.  One can also use the <code>begin...end</code> syntax for this.</li>
<li>Alternative combinators, <code>refl &lt;|&gt; simp</code>  try the first tactic, and if it fails applies the second.  IIRC, the <code>&lt;|&gt;</code> doesn't show up in the Lean server position information, only the individual tactics (and only the second tactic if the first fails).</li>
<li>The <code>calc</code> tactic, is mostly syntactic sugar for other stuff and is handled differently.  IIRC, it doesn't not get any position information in the Lean server.</li>
<li>There are also interactive conversion tactics, which are tactics in another monad (used with the <code>conv</code> tactic).  Their state uses <code>|</code> instead <code>|-</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, there can be a lot of nesting of tactics.  Here are a few discussion points:</p>
<ul>
<li>For semicolon combinators, e.g. <code>induction n n ih; simp</code>, the second tactic can be applied to more than one goal state, so there isn't necessarily a single goal state associated with, say, <code>simp</code> in this case.  (In other rare cases, the final tactic in the chain isn't even executed.)</li>
<li>It isn't uncommon to see a new tactic proof started in the middle of another tactic proof, like <code>rw [by foo]</code> where <code>by foo</code> is a new tactic proof.  This is most apparent in the <code>calc</code> tactic, but you see it other places.</li>
<li>Of course there are tactic combinators like <code>try</code> and <code>repeat</code> and <code>conv</code> followed by <code>{...}</code> or <code>begin...end</code> blocks of tactics.</li>
<li>I assume you are not interested in parsing term proofs, but Lean mixes term proofs and tactic proof fairly readily, including inside the same proof.  I don't know a good way to record term proofs with position information.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's incredibly helpful, yes!  Thanks so much for taking the time to share these thoughts, it will help a whole lot ^^  Some brief answers below.</p>

<p>As for the boundaries, do you know if it is easy to get the end position out of the Lean C++ parser?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, I think that info is not does no exist. For symbols it's OK (we can use word boundaries), and for tactics that's where we want to hook into the parser, so we can raise some sort of begin/end events every time we start/end to parse a tactic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for the internal tables, are you referring to the tables used by the language server?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here is a discussion of the different types of Lean tactics you will encounter. (I'm not as familiar with Coq, so I don't know how many are their as well.) […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks, that's super helpful. Coq has all the facilities you listed, I think, though they are used a bit differently because of Coq's hard-baked notion of "sentence" (basically, one meaningful proof step, implemented as one or multiple tactics). </p>
<p>One basic design decision in Alectryon has been to assume that any goal that's not readily accessible from an IDE isn't super important, so e.g. for repeat we only show the final goal, not any of the intermediate ones.  Same for a <code>;</code>-sequence, where we show the end result but not the evolution of the goals through the pipeline.  It's common in Coq to actually structure proofs in this way, with interesting intermediate states at the end of sentences (<code>.</code>-separated in Coq).  So for example in Coq you would do <code>induction x; simpl; intros; eauto.</code> and Alectryon will only show the goals that were not solved by eauto, with the assumption that the others were not interesting.  But if you care to show all the goals, then you could write <code>induction x; simpl; intros. all: eauto.</code> and then Alectryon will show all goals after <code>intros</code> and then only the remaining ones after <code>eauto</code>.</p>

<p>The parser is already too late to get end positions, the data about where tokens end is known only to the scanner and discarded immediately. Adding end positions to everything would be quite a bit of work, but adding it only in a few places like the comma after a tactic wouldn't be so bad</p>

<p>The hardest thing in my experience is getting the end of a <code>by</code> tactic block.  Imagine <code>by exact …</code>.</p>
