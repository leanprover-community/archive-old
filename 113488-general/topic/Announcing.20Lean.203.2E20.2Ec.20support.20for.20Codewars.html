<p>The Codewars community is excited to announce the immediate availability of Lean 3.20.c for 89% of all Lean Kata (challenges) as of 12/10/2020, with the percentage expected to increase as the remaining content are migrated from 3.18.c. Here at Codewars, we believe that practice makes perfect and in order to ensure the continued quality of our platform as an invaluable training resource for those wishing to learn Lean and/or further refine their Lean-fu, it is necessary to update our Lean version on a regular basis.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there are 95 Kata of varying difficulty to choose from, with topics including but not limited to: number theory, algebra, analysis, synthetic geometry and even category theory. With your help, we can further expand our library of available Kata and support an ever more diverse range of Lean challenges.</p>
<p>Happy sparring, and donâ€™t forget to cast your votes on Kata you have completed along the way <span aria-label="martial arts" class="emoji emoji-1f94b" role="img" title="martial arts">:martial_arts:</span> </p>
