<p>hey all, does anyone know an easy way to see all the messages sent by (say) the lean extension to and from the Lean server? I'd even be happy with having to use the online REPL, I think i've seen someone mention that as a possibility somewhere</p>

<p>If you use the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-web-editor">#webeditor</a>, you can click the purple (?) and there's a checkbox at the bottom to show the messages in your browser's console.</p>
