<p>So, I've written up a definition of Heyting Algebras and some very basic properties, as well as the 3-value Heyting Algebra as an example of a Heyting algebra that isn't a boolean algebra, but I am just going off wikipedia and a topology textbook so don't really know what results people would want to have.<br>
I just now found the style guide and naming convention documents, so I need to go over those and make my file confirm, but I guess I wanted to drop down a heads up, and I guess ask for "write access to non-master branches"?<br>
I am Nolrai on Github, and have a B.S. in math and in CS, my money making job is doing contract java programing for android apps, but it's not what I want to spend the rest of my life doing. :) I've never been part of a project this big before. It's exciting!</p>
