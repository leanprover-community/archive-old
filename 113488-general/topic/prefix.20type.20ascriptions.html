<p>Sometimes I've thought a type ascription or cast could be clearer in certain cases if the type came at the beginning rather than at the end like in <code>(x : t)</code>.  I know <code>show t, from x</code> exists, but it's rather long in comparison, and I don't find it to be very mnemonic for things that aren't proofs.  Borrowing an idea from <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw50/CLHS/Body/s_the.htm">common lisp</a>, a possible alternative is <code>the t, x</code>.</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">notation</span> <span class="bp">`</span><span class="n">the</span> <span class="bp">`</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="bp">`</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="bp">`</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This isn't anything like a serious proposal. I just thought I'd mention it in case it's interesting to anyone, or in case anyone has other ways of writing the type first.</p>
<p>For example, as a prefix it acts more like a coercion operator:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">foo</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">α</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span><span class="bp">*</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">option</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Of course, there's no need for new notation for this:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">α</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span><span class="bp">*</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">x</span>

<span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">foo</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">α</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span><span class="bp">*</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">option</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="n">x</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>However, it's sort of nice how notation lets you avoid additional parentheses in both the type and the term.</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">foo'</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">ℤ</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">17</span> <span class="bp">+</span> <span class="mi">20</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>(In the realm of mnemonic notation, it seems that <code>$</code> can generally be pronounced as "of", and if one wanted it'd make a reasonable notation:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">notation</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="bp">`</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="bp">`</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">0</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">a</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This goes against a quasi-rule, though, that infix notation should contain non-alphanumeric symbols.)</p>

<p>Note that <code>show</code> has different elaboration rules to <code>:</code>, and can prevent lemmas matching if part of the statement.</p>

<p>It is important to note that having the type after the term/variable is not purely a stylistic decision. As Lean has dependent types, the type of a declaration has to come after its parameters and the binders keep this ordering for consistency's sake. </p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="315577">@Mac</span> It seems you think I'm suggesting replacing <code>:</code>?  I only mean to suggest that every once in a while readability can be improved if the type comes first, and this a possible way to accomplish it.</p>
<p>Also, what does dependent types have to do with this? other than the fact that in dependent type theory there's a <code>x : t</code> convention? In each binder, neither the variable nor the type can refer to each other, so they could reasonably come in either order.  I follow you as far as there being many benefits to having so-called "<a href="https://letoverlambda.com/index.cl/toc">duality of syntax</a>" where conceptually related things are written the same way.</p>

<p>That was pretty much my whole point. The reason the type comes after a variable in a binder or ascription is so it mirrors the fact that the type comes after a signature in a declaration (the later of which is necessary because of dependent types).</p>

<p>In some ways it makes more sense to have <code>\lam (the T, x), e</code> from a binding structure point of view since <code>x</code> binds in <code>e</code> but not in <code>T</code>; putting the variable after the type means that you can add <code>x</code> to the context reading strictly left to right without having to skip over <code>T</code>. (In some languages, the lambda is represented internally as <code>lam T (x. e)</code> to make this binding structure explicit.)</p>

<p>I think what Mac was saying is that we can't have c++ style signatures for things due to dependent typing (i.e. no <code>a^n + b^n ≠ c^n theorem flt (a b c : ℕ) (hc : c ≥ 2) (h : a*b*c ≠ 0)</code>). But I agree with everyone else, I think this notation is nice.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="315577">@Mac</span> One could argue that type ascription notation is backwards for dependent type reasons, and having it is a concession to "duality of syntax."  You can't write the function <code>def the (α : Type*) (x : α) := x</code> with reversed arguments.</p>
<p>This might explain why every once in a while there's an expression where I feel like I'd rather put the type first.</p>

<p>I agree with everyone here that type ascriptions in the reverse order (i.e., <code>the Nat x</code> or, what I would like, just <code>Nat x</code> or <code>Nat(x)</code>) are useful, and, as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="306601">@Kyle Miller</span> pointed out, more logical with respect to dependent type theory. I was simply noting the logic behind not doing them that  way is likely for "duality of syntax". Since types have to be written after the main signature a <code>def</code> for DTT, they are as written such in other places (bindings, type ascriptions, etc.) as well.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="315577">@Mac</span> Sorry I'm still pulling on this thread about your claim that "as Lean has dependent types, the type of a declaration has to come after its parameters."  In DTT, every term has a well-defined type, so there's no need for a type in a declaration.  Imagine a bizarro-Lean where terms come after the type in a type ascription.  Then this would be a valid way to write a definition:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">lemma</span> <span class="n">const</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="kt">Prop</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">p</span> <span class="n">q</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">p</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">q</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="bp">λ</span> <span class="n">h</span> <span class="n">_</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">h</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This also has the nice property that you are able to see the type near the <code>:=</code></p>

<p>(One problem with <code>Nat x</code> is that pi types have an evaluation rule in Lean, so you wouldn't be able to distinguish that kind of evaluation from a type ascription.  You could get <code>Nat(x)</code> to work if you make whitespace significant, making <code>Nat (x)</code> parse differently.)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="306601">@Kyle Miller</span> fair enough -- it would be more accurate to say that, if a declaration it has an explicit type, it has to come after its parameters.
