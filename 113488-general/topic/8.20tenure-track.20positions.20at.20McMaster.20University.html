<p>We're hiring! 8 new positions in CS/SE. All areas (even though the ad kind of tries to shy away from that, believe the first sentence). </p>
<p>We are very formal-friendly. Many of us already use theorem provers in our daily work. We'd love more. Jeff Zucker is still here, even though he's retired; he did his PhD formalizing Real Analysis in Automath in the early 1970s! And of course there's Bill Farmer too, co-author of IMPS. Wolfram Kahl and I are quite active around Agda. Mark Lawford uses PVS a fair bit. Others use model checkers, and so on.</p>
<p>Your main work should have a definite CS/SE flavour though. We are called "Computing &amp; Software", after all.</p>
