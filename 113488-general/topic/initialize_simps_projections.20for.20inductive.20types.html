<p>Is there any prospect of enabling <code>@[simps]</code> for inductive types? This was suggested at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/13744#discussion_r860218917">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/13744#discussion_r860218917</a> by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="310045">@Eric Wieser</span>. As far as I understand, there's no easy way to make this work, so we won't hold up this PR for it, but I thought I'd check in with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="111080">@Floris van Doorn</span> on it.</p>

<p>This is indeed not possible using the current implementation. It could be added, but it's not trivial. I'm not planning to add in it Lean 3, but I might be interested in doing it in Lean 4 at some point. I added it to <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/5489">#5489</a>.</p>
