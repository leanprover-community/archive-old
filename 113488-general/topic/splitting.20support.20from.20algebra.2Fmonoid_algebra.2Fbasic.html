<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>I find <code>algebra/monoid_algebra/basic</code> way too big and slow.   Moreover, I am planning to add more lemmas about the support of elements in <code>add_monoid_algebra</code>s.  Rather than adding more lemmas to this already very large file, I am thinking of splitting off lemmas that specifically talk about the support to a new file.</p>
<p>It turns out that this removes very few lemmas from the big file, but at least it is a step in what I consider to be the right direction!</p>
<p>Anyone has any opinion?</p>

<p>If you want to take a look at the current split, I am trying it in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/16322">#16322</a>.</p>
