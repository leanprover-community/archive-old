<p>I was debugging some strange behavior <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/11315">#11315</a> with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="260507">@Heather Macbeth</span> and noticed (once again) things were pretty slow. It reminded me of type class issues we had a while back, so I looked at the instance search trace, and the trace for a tiny <code>simp only</code>that took 300ms was &gt; 15k lines long. It's entirely failing searches for subsingleton instances.</p>

<p>Which means that these <code>subsingleton</code> instances are costing a lot of compile time. <code>char_p.subsingleton</code> seems especially rare to fire, but at least it doesn't lead to another open search like the others, it fails a bit quicker.</p>

<p>I also struggled with the problem a while ago (and asked about it here on Zulip). At the time, this magical incantation solved all my problems:<br>

It requires putting <code>open_locale disable_subsingleton_simps</code> at the top of subsequent files.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with this refactoring so far is the following: <code>simp [if_congr]</code> doesn't work, it doesn't pick up <code>if_congr</code> as a congruence lemma.<br>
Similarly, <code>attribute [my_simp_set] if_congr</code> also (silently) fails.</p>

<p>Automatically detecting whether something is a congr lemma or a simp lemma is also hard.</p>

<p>This is a much more useful change than I'd expected.  The automatically generated congr lemmas were simply broken because they generated decidable instance diamonds.  While porting mathlib, I need to add a lot of <code>*_congr</code> lemmas but in exchange simp becomes more powerful.</p>

<p>Hmm, this now runs into limitations with congr lemmas. <span aria-label="sad" class="emoji emoji-2639" role="img" title="sad">:sad:</span> </p>
<p>Simply put, we cannot declare a manual congr lemma for <code>ite p a b x</code>.  I'll try to generate the lemmas automatically.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/pull/665">lean#665</a> now automatically creates the congr lemmas that we expect for decidability arguments, that is,<br>
<code>∀ ... [i : decidable p] [j : decidable q], @f p i = @f q j</code>.</p>
<p>If there is a rough consensus that we want this, then I'd like to merge the Lean PR and get a new release out soon.  (So that the mathlib branch doesn't rot too much.)</p>

<p>It's a somewhat hacky approach, since it only supports <code>decidable</code> arguments.  We want the same treatment for e.g. <code>fintype</code> as well, but there custom congr lemmas are still required (for example <code>fintype.card_congr</code>).</p>
<p>There's also the question about how this will work in Lean 4.  But if it is a welcome change for mathlib, then that makes it easier to push for the same behavior in Lean 4.</p>

<p>Just to check that I understand what you are doing here. You made a change in core after which <code>simp</code> does not try to infer subsingleton instances on everything, right (which should be a nice performance improvement)? But to make sure <code>simp</code> still remains powerful enough, you have added a bunch of congr lemmas (either created by hand, or autogenerated) to imitate the old behavior. Right?</p>

<p>Yes, simp no longer infers subsingleton instances everywhere (although the simp lemma <code>eq_iff_true_of_subsingleton</code> will of course infer subsingleton instances for every equality).</p>
<p>The subsingleton instances were used by simp to create better congruence lemmas, simp could rewrite <code>list.filter xs p</code> to <code>list.filter xs p'</code> because the <code>[decidable_pred p]</code> argument was a <em>subsingleton</em>.   The downside of this feature was that the new decidable_pred instance  was <code>eq.rec ... _inst_1</code> (i.e., a beautiful diamond).  The subsingleton change made simp significantly less powerful, by no longer being able to rewrite the predicate in <code>list.filter</code> (and lots of other other functions).</p>
<p>Writing all these congruence lemmas (such as for list.filter) is cumbersome and didn't work in all cases (such as for <code>ite p f g x</code>).  Therefore the PR includes a second (more significant) change, which adds special support for decidable instance arguments in the congruence lemma generator.  As a bonus, it now generates congruence lemmas that avoid diamonds.</p>

<p>Personally I think it's a net improvement even with the hackiness! The fact that adding innocent looking <code>subsingleton</code> instances can have such a huge effect on the most important tactic feels like a pretty bad thing. If the fix improves instance diamonds, even better.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110043">@Gabriel Ebner</span> I managed to bump LTE to this newest version of mathlib. It went quite smoothly, and I was happy to see a bunch of <code>congr</code>'s gone, because <code>simp</code> became more powerful.</p>
<p>Is there some commit message that explains exactly what changed, and how users should update their mental model of <code>simp</code>? Does this warrant a short blogpost? It seems to me one of the biggest changes to Lean in several months.<br>
(Aside: do you think the changes impacted the performance of <code>simp</code> -- up or down?)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> You shouldn't need to update your mental model of simp.  The only thing that changed is that simp now magically does the expected thing more often.  The closest thing to an explanation is my response to Sébastien above: <a href="#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/simp.20and.20subsingleton.20instances/near/267492975">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/simp.20and.20subsingleton.20instances/near/267492975</a>  I can also write a longer explanation for the blog if you think that's interesting.</p>
<p>Re: performance improvement.  I think mathlib's gotten a little faster, but nothing spectacular.  Hopefully Jannis' bot will give more substantial data to evaluate the change.  I also tried removing the <code>local attribute [-instance]</code> commands in mathlib, but there's still two of those analysis lemmas timing out (to be fair, they're already at the edge of timing out right now).</p>

<p>Ok, thanks for confirming that I can kepp using <code>simp</code> as I'm used to. I could imagine a blogpost about the <code>congr</code>-lemma change. But you are in a better position to judge whether there's enough material for a story. I just got the impression that this was one of the more substantial changes to Lean in quite a while, so it might be worth it.</p>
