<p>The topic name might be slightly misleading.<br>
Say I wanted to prove the following lemma:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">lemma</span> <span class="n">test</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">X</span> <span class="n">Y</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">h</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">X</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="n">Y</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">X</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Y</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="gr">sorry</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The lemma is obviously false, but that is not the point.<br>
My problem is, that I cannot even formulate the lemma, because x and y have different types, which totally makes sense.<br>
But then I also know that the types are the same, so I should somehow be allowed to speak about equality of x and y.</p>
<p>Is there some way to make my example work?</p>

<p>Yes, this is called heterogeneous equality. You can write <code>x == y</code>. But it isn't very pleasant to work with.</p>

<p>The "philosophy" is that if <code>X Y : Type</code> and <code>a b : X</code> then talking about <code>a = b</code> is sensible, but talking about <code>X = Y</code> is a bit more dangerous because <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are "one level up" from <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, so the correct notion of "same"ness is an <code>equiv</code>, <code>e : X ≃ Y</code>, which is defined to be maps in both directions whose composite both ways is the identity. In your example you can then talk about <code>e x = y</code>, and here you avoid the dreaded <code>==</code> completely. You can even see it with the <code>Prop</code> universe -- it is not really reasonable to say that Fermat's Last Theorem is equal to 2+2=4, but they are logically equivalent because they're both true, and here the appropriate notion of sameness is <code>↔</code>.</p>

<p>Except <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/propext">docs#propext</a> means you really can say that <code>2+2=4</code> and Fermat's last theorem are equal.</p>

<p>The very fact that this is an axiom and some people don't believe it is already an indication that something funny is going on.</p>

<p>I'm not sure that there is anyone who thinks this axiom is not true; in fact it's basically baby-HoTT, being the univalence axiom for <code>Prop</code></p>

<p>If you think that types should be syntactically generated (like an inductive type) then perhaps you want to deny this axiom</p>

<p>Generally speaking, something being an axiom is evidence that people think it's true, not that people think it is false</p>
