<p>For <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/6786">#6786</a> it looks like there is a subproblem with a diamond (<code>semiring -&gt; monoid_with_zero -&gt; has_zero</code> and <code>semiring -&gt; non_unital_non_assoc_semiring -&gt; has_zero</code>) that the elaborator needs to do a lot of work on. Somehow it doesn't use the rest of the expression to infer missing metavariables, instead choosing <code>nat</code> as a default value. I think the problem has turned from first-order to higher-order unification, and that higher-order unification makes some unfortunate choices here.</p>

<p>Could there be a cheap fix involving lowering or raising a priority?</p>

<p>I expect that changing priorities would fix one half of usages and break the other half. It might well be possible that the fixed half is exactly the lemmas that are in mathlib now, and the broken half the ones that are added later.</p>

<p>I also think that there's a problematic diamond at play here.  But the issue is not related to higher-order unification, it is plain old first-order unification:</p>

<p>The problem is that Lean needs to assign <code>?m_2 : field ?m_1</code> or <code>?m_3 : monoid_with_zero ?m_1</code>.<br>
But there is no obvious choice for <code>?m_2</code> or <code>?m_3</code>.  Or at least none that Lean could find by unfolding <code>field.to_has_zero</code>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, unification hints are pretty broken in Lean 3.  For example, the hint above doesn't work if you replace <code>Type</code> by <code>Type*</code>...</p>

<p>That probably explains why I've never had any luck doing anything with a unification hint, as <code>Type*</code> is muscle memory at this point.</p>

<p>I can't reconstruct this issue in Lean 4.  Mostly because Lean 4 will completely refuse to elaborate terms if it can't synthesize all instance arguments.  For example, you just can't use <code>cases le_or_gt _ _</code> in Lean 4.</p>

<p>Something interesting happen in one of my PR, see <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/6831#discussion_r599508067">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/6831#discussion_r599508067</a></p>
<p>If you don't want to look at the two PR here is what happened: in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/6746">#6746</a> I introduced <code>semi_normed_group</code>, and several lemmas stopped working. The solution was almost always to use some extra <code>@</code>. The PR got bigger and bigger, so I decided to split it, and in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/6831">#6831</a> I generalized  Lipschitz maps for <code>pseudo_emetric_space</code> (this was part of the other PR). Now, some of the problems appeared also in this PR (this is already interesting, since I thought they come from the new class <code>semi_normed_group</code>, while they come from  Lipschitz maps). Even more interesting, a new problem appeared (of the same nature), the one in the above comment. Now,  I know that it will disappear when everything is generalized to <code>semi_normed_group</code>, so I now think that also the other ones will go away if everything is stated in the correct generality.</p>
