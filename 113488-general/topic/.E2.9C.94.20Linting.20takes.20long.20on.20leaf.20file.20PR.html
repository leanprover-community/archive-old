<p>I have recently pushed a PR that just adds a file to mathlb (in particular, nothing depends on it so far). Building mathlib was quite fast, as I expected, but linting took more than half an hour. The info page I get when clicking on "details" showed <code>Run ./scripts/mk_all.sh</code> for most of that time.<br>
My naïve question is (1) what is going on there, and (2) is it necessary?<br>
I would think that it should be sufficient just to run the linter on the new file. But I havfe been wrong with similar simple-minded expectations before...</p>

<p>Linting is run on all files, even if only a tiny change is made to a leaf. In that sense it is even more coarse grained than compiling oleans themselves.<br>
You can probably find other conversations about this here, but in short it is once again a nontrivial problem. A leaf file can add a simp lemma that breaks an earlier one (in the sense that the simp_nf linter will complain about it now), so it is not enough to only check the new file. <code>simp_nf</code> is apparently one of the slowest linters anyway, so we might not even gain that much by running only a select few linters on all files.</p>

<p>Thanks. I guess I was expecting something along these lines, without being able to predict what exactly.</p>
