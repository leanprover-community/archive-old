<p>Currently, if the latest commit of a PR is in progress, <code>leanproject up</code> becomes somewhat self-defeating, because it always pulls to get the latest version even if that commit doesn't have a cache. Would it be possible to modify the behavior so that it gets the last version that has a cache? It should also set the remaining files as dirty so that lean knows to compile them, if necessary (I think this is automatic).</p>

<p>This was also suggested <a href="#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/leanproject.20get-cache.20looks.20further.20back.3F">here</a>. (I haven't had time to work on this.)</p>
