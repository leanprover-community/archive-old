<p>Hi! Exercise 3 on topological spaces says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Define the indiscrete topology on any type using this.<br>
(To do it without this it is surprisingly fiddly to prove that the set <code>{∅, univ}</code> actually forms a topology)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is that to say it is surprisingly fiddly to do without using an inductive type?</p>

<p>Yes, to prove that <code>{∅, univ}</code> is a topology in the same way that I prove the discrete topology is a topology in that file (not cheating and saying the smallest thing generated by it) I found far longer than I expected.</p>

<p>Does that mean we are now missing the fact that it is the coarsest topology?</p>

<p>Yes we haven't proved that <code>{∅, univ}</code> itself is actually a topology, just constructed some topology whose open sets we don't have that explicit description for.</p>

<p>We know that there is a coarsest topology, and that it is <code>generate_from empty</code></p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="111080">@Floris van Doorn</span>  worked through a proof of this during this afternoon's session</p>

<p><code>{∅, univ}</code> might be the first definition of the indiscrete topology you'll think of, but another definition like <code>is_open A ↔ ∀ x y, x ∈ A → y ∈ A</code> might be easier to work with</p>

<p>Yes my definition could be an artifact of the fact I originally set up the demo file using <code>set (set X)</code> rather than <code>set X \to Prop</code> before noticing the latter worked better.</p>
