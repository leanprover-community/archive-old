<p>The threads made interesting reading. I discovered Gabriel Ebner's project porting the Lean 2 HoTT library to Lean 3 - I will try to use it asap.</p>
<p>I also liked how Kevin Buzzard and you insist that the ordinary working mathematician does not want to be bothered with type theory, let alone homotopy type theory. But the point for me is something else to what Kevin alludes: Type theory, and then homotopy type theory allows to do maths in a way that working mathematicians are much more used to than proofs in ZFC. There are more mathematical objects  than just sets; types are sets "done right", with proper objects as elements; and with univalence you can argue up to isomorphism. That's what allured me to (homotopy) type theory, not some perverse interest in foundations. And that's why I also don't care if homotopy type theory does not make formalizing easier (a comment of Mario Carneiro), it just should not get more difficult (and unfortunately, there is a possibility for that, as Floris van Doorn pointed out). My hope is that it feels more natural, and that's what will attract mathematicians.</p>
<p>Actually, there is a fascinating parallel to the change from 19th to 20th century mathematics: The reason why mathematicians followed the more formal ways of doing mathematics paved by Hilbert and leading up to Bourbaki, despite the rage of the old and influential guard around Felix Klein and Henri Poincare, was not thatbthey cared so much about foundations, but becuase it was easier to do mathematics that way. Frank Quinn wrote a lot about this era and what conclusions we should draw from it nowadays  : <a href="https://www.ams.org/notices/201201/rtx120100031p.pdf">https://www.ams.org/notices/201201/rtx120100031p.pdf</a> . I think that's also a point against Kevin's dismissal of "implementation issues":They play a decisive role, but often in a way not consciously recognized.</p>
<p>I think for the next time I will continue to formalize localization in my little project (and maybe extend it to the formalization of schemes, which Kevin would like to see).  Then I will have a better idea whether my hopes are realistic and will be ready for a more substantial discussion.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="126734">@Thomas Eckl</span> Those are very good points, and I think I mostly agree with what you say. I find HoTT (as a general principle, not 1 implementation, so also cubical stuff, etc) very enticing as a mathematician.</p>
<p>But <em>right now</em> I do not see what it buys me when I try to formalise things. And this is probably mostly a technical issue. Currently, the univalence principle is an extremely nice idea, but the implementations in current provers are such that in practice you avoid it. (This is what I learnt explicitly during my brief experiment in Coq.)</p>
<p>I also think that the burden of proof for usability rests with the proponents of HoTT. But it seems that the community around HoTT is (mostly) more interested in pushing the foundations, rather than demonstrating that you can do "real-world maths" in proof assistants using HoTT.</p>
<p>And that's totally fine. Because maybe by pushing those foundations, they will solve the problems I was talking about 2 paragraphs up. And maybe it will just take some time before enough mathematicians jump on the bandwagon.<br>
But I'm not the right person for developing these foundations. So right now, I'm happy to use Lean, because that's where the maths is happening, and that's what I care about.</p>
<p>In the end, and that's also what Kevin has stressed before, lots of people should just try lots of systems. That's the best way to push their boundaries, and the best way to figure out what we really need.</p>

<p>I think that if we can finally get mathematicians using these systems there will be a lot of things we will learn about their pros and cons when it comes to mathematics.</p>

<p>The last page suggests that we should redesign NNG (kids don't like walls of text), and give some really precise and clear explanations. And then just make 8 year old kids play the game.</p>

<p>Yeah I've said this before -- the NNG could really benefit from being looked at by someone who actually knows what they're doing. If we could get it working on mobile it would be awesome but maybe this is just asking too much.</p>

<p>Yeah for mobile it seems there would need to be a remote lean server, rather than actually running lean on the phone. Perhaps this is something that should be thought about in conjunction with the <a href="#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cloud.20computing.20possibilities/near/197868435">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/cloud.20computing.20possibilities/near/197868435</a> cloud computing thread. How feasible is it to have a lean server that everyones app connects to (probably to one lean instance each) that then runs 10 sessions of the nng at once?</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the beauty of a dedicated general server, the NNG is actually run on an Imperial College server AFAIK. So on the phone all you'd need would be a web browser-:)</p>

<p>The issue with mobile and the NNG is that the web editor uses <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/">Monaco</a>, which has terrible mobile support. In fact, most Javascript text editors are pretty awful on mobile devices at the moment. I'm hoping that <a href="https://codemirror.net/6/">Codemirror 6</a> will solve all our issues, but it's still not ready for primetime (and we'd have to write some new integration code as well).</p>

<p>A full blown editor with some extension support certainly makes it much easier to work with Lean, since the editor should be able to display the info / warning / error diagnostics, be able to provide completions, as well as support hover for doc strings, etc. And this is even before trying to implement the new widget functionality, which greatly increases usability of the tactic state...</p>

<p>for NNG this kind of interface could be wonderful - the ability to type arbitrary text is more of an obstacle than a help there, IMHO.</p>

<p>In this vein, something like Scratch for tactic proofs would be cool.  I once looked into whether something like this existed when I taught a discrete math course a couple years ago, but I don't remember anything turning up.</p>
