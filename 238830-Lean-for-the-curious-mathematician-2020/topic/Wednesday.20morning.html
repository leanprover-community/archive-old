<p>Hello everyone, the first session will start in 15 minutes.</p>
<p>The first speaker of today is Floris van Doorn, and he will explain about "structures and classes". Because it is currently in the middle of the night at his side of the earth, Floris has kindly pre-recorded two videos.</p>
<p>Please watch the first video, and then join the breakout rooms. Halfway through the session, we will send a broadcast message, to remind everyone to start watching the second video.</p>
<p>The videos are available at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlF-CfQhukNloaV_NiVvgJt-Pr6lQd56q">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlF-CfQhukNloaV_NiVvgJt-Pr6lQd56q</a> .</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the content of the videos, please ask the tutor in your breakout room!</p>
