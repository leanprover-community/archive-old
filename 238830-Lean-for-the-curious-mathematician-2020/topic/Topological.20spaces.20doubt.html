<p>For structure/record construction notation, <code>..m</code> means to include all of <code>m</code>'s fields.</p>

<p>Thanks, why commenting them does not give a type error?</p>

<p>This is where the documentation for that notation should be, but it seems to be absent: <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/reference/declarations.html#id10">https://leanprover.github.io/reference/declarations.html#id10</a> (I haven't been able to find where it's described...)</p>
<p>I'll check what you're saying about commenting it out.</p>

<p>Ah, in this case those are redundant because <code>metric_space</code> is defined to be a <code>class</code> (which is a <code>structure</code> with the <code>[class]</code> attribute and some special support for doing class things), so Lean is inferring the rest of the fields because  <code>metric_space</code> extends <code>topological_space</code> and <code>metric_space_basic</code>, and these are already implemented by <code>metric_space_basic</code> through instances defined previously.  Someone more knowledgeable than me would have a more informative answer -- I don't really know how this works expect through practice.</p>

<p>Try commenting out the <code>compatible</code> line to see the error you would normally get due to missing fields.</p>

<p>Nice catch, it looks like lean is smarter than I gave it credit for?!. Like Kyle says it knows how to fill these fields automatically given the available info. If you put <code>#print of_basic</code> after and compare the results of deleting and undeleting the lines you can see that although it changes the definition visually, what lean puts is equivalent but a more compact way of writing what my definition gave.</p>
