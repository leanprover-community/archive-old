<p>I'm a Windows user and I installed lean using the instructions at <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/windows.html">https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/windows.html</a> but still can't deal with anything that isn't basic lean. <br>
For example, when I try to import something in Vscode using "import data.set data.int.basic data.set.function <br>
import data.set.lattic" at the beginning of the code it tells me "file 'data\set' not found in the search path" and a bunch more of error messages. I'd like to use Lean on VsCode because it would help me to know what the functions do.</p>

<p>Have you created a Lean project as mentioned on the next page? <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html">https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html</a></p>

<p>When I tried coding through a repository I cloned from a professor, it wan't working. But after creating a project like in this link it didn't have any problems with the import command, thanks!</p>

<p>If the repository is itself a Lean project that depends on mathlib, running <code>leanproject get-mathlib-cache</code> in that directory might get things working.</p>
