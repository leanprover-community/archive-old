<p>One thing I think would be really cool is a session some sort of pair/trio/quadruplet programming, where a few "curious mathematicians" and a "proficient lean user" get in a zoom/BBB call for an hour say with the aim of each of the curious mathematicians formalizing one definition or theorem statement from their field. The idea is to have a more personal and condensed version of the interactions we often have on the zulip where questions can have a more fluid question/answer cycle with screensharing and extended conversation. the ratio of lean users to mathematicians  of course will have to depend on the signups!</p>

<p>Do you mean that they should already understand the topic? Or just have some prior warning enough to look up the wikipedia page? Of course it depends on the topic, if the definition is hypergraphs or matroids or some separation axiom for topological spaces its going to be way more possible than manifolds with boundary, but I'm hoping everyone has something in their field they might present the definition of in a colloquium talk for instance. But I'm really thinking of an interactive conversation where the lean user doesnt necessarily know the answer immediately!</p>

<p>And of course if the interested mathematician is an undergraduate or school student (ie no giving colloquium talks!)  then hopefully whatever definition they're interested in is also on wikipedia or fairly well known.</p>

<p>Could you also correct your differential geometry speaker?  And Yury's surname is spelled differently than I have usually seen it (which does not necessarily mean that it is spelled wrong).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="260507">@Heather Macbeth</span> Russian authorities have at least 3 different opinions on the correct spelling of my name/surname as can be seen from my 3 passports (yes, the idea "reuse the transliteration we used last time" is too hard for them).</p>
