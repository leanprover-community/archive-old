<p>If you want to be tutor in a pair/triple programming session during this workshop, please leave a ping here.<br>
The idea would be that one or two beginners try to write some lean code in an area that interests them.<br>
The tutor should judge whether the topic is suitable for the experience level of the participant. (Intermediate users could dabble in tactic writing, or tricky definitions, but beginners probably shouldn't.)</p>
<p>A group can then start a video call with screen sharing, and discuss the code as they are writing it.</p>

<p>I would be very grateful if someone knowing the formalization of perfectoid spaces pretty well can show me which lemmas need to deal with isomorphisms of localized rings, a problem that Kevin Buzzard highlighted in his Edinburgh talk on the project last year.  I am not sure what's the best way to find such lemmas: Use search tools in Lean? Other search tools? Just find my way through the code myself?</p>
<p>Actually, Kevin's remarks prompted me to think about the usefulness of HoTT for problems like this. I started formalizing things in Lean 2, and now put the code on GitHub : <a href="https://github.com/theckl/HoTT-Case-Study">https://github.com/theckl/HoTT-Case-Study</a> , together with an extensive Readme file about the details of the project and the philosophy behind it (including a suggestion how to use HoTT in fashionable mathematics!).</p>
<p>Note that I am an Algebraic Geometer (from the primordial soup) usually working on problems (yet) far away from formalization. So I tick some of the boxes of the intended audience and hope that I am allowed to ask these HoTT-related questions in this conference, despite Johan's initial warning yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> Thanks for your hint to the formalisation of schemes. I downloaded Ramon Fernandez Mir's project and used the search tools that you showed us on Wednesday - participating in the conference pays off! ;-) I think I know now where to find all the little lemmas on isomorphisms of localizations: not too surprisingly in the construction of the structure sheaf. </p>
<p>I stiil would love to hear opinions of Lean 3 users on HoTT. Maybe we can arrange a meeting after the conference, when you are not so busy. Or is the modern way to discuss a chat in Zulip?</p>

<p>If you want to go further, then there is an exercise in Hartshorne's book on algebraic geometry about gluing sheaves on open subsets of a topological space (basically showing that if the sheaves on the open subspaces agree on overlaps and the isomorphisms satisfy a cocycle condition then they can be glued to make a sheaf on the whole space which agrees with the original sheaves when restricted to the open subsets). Kenny Lau did this exercise in Lean and it was hard work, but possible.</p>

<p>My original development of schemes had a huge design flaw which I worked around because I was determined to get it to work. I supervised Ramon's MSc project on schemes and he did it in a much better way, using universal properties of localisations rather than the concrete definition; this is somehow a crucial insight.</p>

<p>I am not exactly sure what your original approach was, but I liked a lot Ramon's project. Maybe I can extend my little project on formalization to a complete formalization of schemes and thus comply with your wishes. But it may also very well happen that I have to admit the unsuitability of HoTT for such efforts - but then I should at least understand better why.</p>
