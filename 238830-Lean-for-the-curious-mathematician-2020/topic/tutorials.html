<p>On the second day, I am down for 3.5 hours of tutorials (based in MiL). I am thinking of something like the following format:</p>
<ul>
<li>I lecture and demo for about 20 minutes.</li>
<li>We ask people to work on a (short) pre-prepared list of exercises for about 20 minutes, with weird Zoom silence while people play around with them.  We can answer verbal questions and questions posed in the chat. </li>
<li>I then call everyone back and we work through the exercises together.</li>
<li>Repeat.<br>
I am anxious about this plan. It could work or it could be a real mess. Does anyone have any thoughts on the matter?</li>
</ul>

<p>My vague idea was to emulate having this is a room full of computers with experienced Lean users walking from computers to computers to help people doing the exercises.  But of course, besides technical issues, this depends a lot on the number of participants.</p>

<p>So people get to share their screens to ask questions? Or use breakout rooms? Or use the Zulip channel or the chat window?</p>
<p>Are we using Zoom? Zoom has breakout groups, so we can break participants into small groups (say, groups of five) and instructors can go from group to group.</p>

<p>My impression from watching a few days of IJCAR is: pre-recorded conference talks are unpleasant. Maybe nobody was planning to do this at LFTCM anyway. But I think we should try to avoid the "record a 30 minute talk and pretend it's live" style.</p>

<p>For the metaprogramming tutorial I'm assigned at LFTCM, my plan was to record a series of short(ish) videos and just put them on YouTube. No pretense that they're live talks at conference time. They'll probably get many more views after the fact than "live" anyway, so it seems better to optimize for that.</p>

<p>No, I've already seen multiple issues today at IJCAR with trying to stream videos over Zoom. It seems dumb, just point people to the video links and let them stream themselves...</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> Is the plan to use Zoom? I am still thinking of a format where I give a short presentation, then we ask people to work on exercises (maybe posted as a gist where everyone can cut-and-paste them). If we have Zoom we can put people in breakout rooms and mathlib experts can go from room to room answering questions.</p>

<p>Some people involved had security/privacy/ethics concerns about Zoom, I don't remember where the discussion landed. Personally, I'm not so worried about that and wouldn't compromise on reliability and features just to avoid Zoom.</p>

<p>There's also <a href="http://timeout.srcf.net">timeout.srcf.net</a>, made by some students at Cambridge which has the same features as Zoom but without the security problems (essentially because they didn't like that the university wasn't helping enough with remote working) but unfortunately it seems that rooms can only be made by cambridge accounts</p>

I think I can start a meeting and then transfer or share the host role with anyone else. That will work for the afternoon sessions.

<p>Using different systems seems like it's asking for trouble. We should really try to standardize on one platform as much as possible. I think "recorded talks are on YouTube, live stuff is on Zoom or whatever" is fine, everyone knows how to use YouTube and there's no interaction. But let's not make people switch from Twitch to Zoom to Jitsi and back.</p>

<p>At least with Zoom, you can have one meeting for the whole week. I've never tried but I'm pretty sure you can easily change host permissions so different people can create breakout rooms etc.</p>

<p>Yeah, when you create a meeting with Zoom, you can reserve the ID / link so that it is yours until it is released. But I think only the host can start. So e.g. if VU hosts for the week, Rob has to start the meeting every day. He can then designate co hosts, and if I understand correctly, the co hosts can designate co hosts. </p>
<p>Oh, and it looks like only the host can create breakout rooms. <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206330935-Enabling-and-adding-a-co-host">https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206330935-Enabling-and-adding-a-co-host</a></p>

<p>Actually, Rob, I think you can start the meeting, and then make anyone else the host. If you are awake and up for it, we can try it. Just start a Zoom meeting and email me the link.</p>

<p>Conclusion: we can transfer host privileges around as much as we want. So I could start a meeting, make Johan the host, and leave, and he can create and assign breakout rooms.</p>

<p>The downside is, it seems only the host can add people to breakout rooms. So if there are "experts" floating around multiple rooms they might need some assistance.</p>

<p>We didn't actually try what happens if you leave completely... but I guess it should work. You still had some superpowers that I didn't. Because you could reclaim being a host.</p>

<p>Ah, maybe. There's a difference between "co-host" and "alternate host" in their documentation but I'm not sure how that's reflected on the site/in the program.</p>

<p>Yeah, I can set an "alternative host" when I schedule the meeting on the website, and the docs say it has to be someone licensed on the same account. That person can start the meeting.</p>
