<p>one question is "ignoring ~all other constraints, what is the most useful sequence of programming to have for ~6 hours a day on ~5 consecutive days," where let's say the objective function is to maximize the probability that each participant either makes a nontrivial PR to mathlib or points to a concrete friction that prevented them from doing so</p>

<p>I'll post my best-guess answer to this question later today in the form of a tentative schedule. I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span>  is forming such a guess independently from me.</p>

<p>I understand all this much better now. A mathematician thinks of the natural numbers as a specification. But if you want to make NNG then you have to think about the implementation. The two types of equality are some sort of dissonance between these two ways of thinking about things.</p>

<p>I'm happy to do this, or set up the files for someone else to do it.</p>
<p>(With the proviso that in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArGLTAjak3g&amp;feature=youtu.be">the demo I usually give</a>, the <code>back</code> tactic is totally cheating, and has been fine-tuned for the problem. But it's faking the sort of thing a good hammer will one day do. :-) I can modify this demo to not cheat fairly easily, at the cost of a little extra time, if people would prefer that.)</p>

<p>Yeah, I think for a workshop like this, it's fine to entice them with a hammer that isn't in mathlib yet, but the hammer shouldn't cheat.</p>

<p>I tried to work a bit on Johan's schedule. Assuming that we will indeed have a couple of real beginners (or that we want to use the opportunity to record nice videos for beginners) I think we need to have two parallel tracks. The beginner track will have more talks and exercises sessions while more advanced people can do pair coding or follow live coding sessions, or spend even more time on Zulip than usual. And of course people can move freely between those two states (especially for library overview sessions). Johan's schedule can then become the beginner track schedule like this:<br>
I took your schedule draft and tried to turn it into a beginner track. Maybe it's too rigid and school-like.</p>

<p>For the beginner track, I think it would be really useful if we (pre)record the talks. It's quite likely that people will want to watch the talks at a later stage as well.</p>

<p>Yes, the measure space refactor is a tricky question. I have the impression that, in many cases, we have a canonical measure on a space, and then having it as a typeclass is really the most convenient thing (especially when building the integral). But it is also true that in some situations you will have several measures that you will want to compare on the same space (e.g. Lebesgue and Gaussian measure on <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant="double-struck">R</mi><mi>n</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{R}^n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68889em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">R</span></span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.664392em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathdefault mtight">n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>), and writing <code>@</code> on all theorems will be painful. Could we have a notation for the integral, in terms of an explicit measure, defined in terms of <code>@integral...</code>?</p>

<p>A solution could be to have a notation for the integral picking the measure from a typeclass, another notation for the integral with an explicit measure, and having the measure as an implicit parameter in the theorems: then the theorem would apply to both notations, and would pick the right measure by unification.</p>

<p>Great. I am happy to do anything. I can give a bottom-up introduction along the lines of MiL, or a top-down one along the lines of TPiL.</p>
<p>It's hard to teach interactive theorem proving in a week -- people need time to experiment and digest. But maybe we can try a format where we give people time to work on exercises and ask questions (in breakout rooms? in a chat window?) and then talk about them.</p>

<p>Jeremy, I know teaching intereactive theorem proving in one week is hard. The hope is to give a kick start. And indeed I imagine half of the time being devoted to exercises sessions.  Hopefully we can have enough mentors to take care of both the beginners and some intermediate users who won't want to do the exercises but will want to ask more questions that week.</p>

<p>There is really no way we can discuss differential geometry before Friday. This is the <code>supr</code> of mathlib, it needs absolutely everything else. Do you still get motivated to clean the rough edges if someone else (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="260507">@Heather Macbeth</span> maybe?) is presenting it?</p>

<p>The main change is I decided that having planned boundaries between talks and exercises sessions was only getting in our way. So It's not that we suddenly expect people to prepare super long lectures. We still hope that most "lectures" will be short, say half an hour for topic lectures, but then there will be long exercises sessions, as explained in the text surrounding the tables.</p>

<p>I merged the PR because it doesn't make sense to look at the diff. The goal is to send announcement emails this week-end, so we need to know whether everybody is happy with the plan. The website has exactly four pages, two of which are very short, so everybody should be able to read everything easily.</p>

<p>My idea for the meta-programming session is indeed to target people who are already mathlib users. The beginner track is already very ambitious, I don't think you can add meta-programming on top of that. So I made it a parallel session, and I moved it early so that some people can attend both this session and the topical sessions on Thursday and Friday.</p>

<p>My idea for this meta-programming session was to cover the content of the tactic writing tutorial plus some discussion of <code>expr</code> juggling, and then have people (re-)writing baby tactics. But of course Rob is free to do whatever he thinks is best, or trying Gabriel to do it or whatever. Johan and I are trying to push this thing so that it actually happen, but we have no dictator dreams here.</p>

<p>Great! It would be nice if you could prepare the topological hierarchy building stuff. For the two Wednesday afternoon sessions, my idea is the main speaker will prepare a sparse Lean file skeleton, maybe with a lot of comments informally describing the intended math content,  comment a bit on the skeleton in the beginning (either live or prerecorded) and then help participants turn it in  an actual Lean file.</p>

<p>So the first task would be to prepare the solutions file, and then make the exercise file out of it. The solution file can copy-paste mathlib content but not too much, we still want simplified versions.</p>

<p>I think it would be great if you could give that one. An option would be to record your talk in advance and prepare the exercises, but have other people helping participants to do the exercises. This is the talk that need the greatest expert, at least if you remove the meta-programming talk which requires different expertise.</p>

<p>Actually we allocated half the afternoon to measure theory and integration but I'm not sure we have so much to show in this direction, especially if the ongoing integration refactor and FTC doesn't land before the workshop.
