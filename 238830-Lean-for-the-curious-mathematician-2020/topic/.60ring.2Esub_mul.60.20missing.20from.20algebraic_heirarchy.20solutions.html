<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span>, did you mean to exclude this lemma from the exercise?</p>

<p>Because to prove it, it seems like I also need <code>ring.neg_mul</code>, <code>ring.zero_mul</code>, and possibly some other lemmas not currently present in that file</p>

<p>I think I proved it for commutative rings when I was going through it but I might have changed it to rings at the last minute :-)</p>

<p>OK I changed it back to commutative rings ;-)</p>
