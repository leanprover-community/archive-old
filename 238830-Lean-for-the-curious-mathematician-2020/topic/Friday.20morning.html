<p>Hello everyone, our next session starts in a bit more than 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Today, we've changed the schedule a little bit. This morning we will have 1 talk by Patrick Massot. The talk on "Calculus", by Yury Kudriashov has been moved to the afternoon, and merged into his other talk on "Measure theory and integration".<br>
