<p>So I moved some of the embedding stuff that was in the <code>cyclotomic/absolute_value.lean</code> file into its own file. I also had a stab at defining real and complex embeddings, its probably not very good, but we can state the unit lemma now.</p>

<p>I started trying to prove the unit lemma based on this.<br>
Some design questions I am having trouble with:</p>
<ul>
<li>When defining a Galois automorphism of a number field is it best to define it as an aut of the field and have a good api for restricting to the ring of integers or unit group, or should we define galois automorphisms on the ring of integers and extend somehow, these should be equivalent, there are lemmas showing that alg homs preserve integrality like <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/is_integral_alg_hom">docs#is_integral_alg_hom</a> so maybe thats enough.</li>
<li>I'm having trouble with the 3 nested structures that are important here, the field itself, its ring of integers and the unit group (and also the roots of unity inside that even). With all these we have multiple coercions which then don't interact well with the algebraic structure always (e.g. if we pass from the unit group to the field then we can commute the inverse and the coercion, but as soon as we insert the ring of integers in between we lose the ability to talk about inverses in that ring so we lose the ability to commute coes and inverses.</li>
<li>More simp lemmas are needed / we should think about which way we want simplifications to go to make the proofs nicer.</li>
</ul>

<p>You could show in general that when you have an extension L/K, then K-algebra automorphisms of L restrict to various substructures (e.g., the integral closure in L of a subring of K).</p>

<p>Concerning •₁, maybe it's worth it to state lemmas for "compatible pairs of automorphisms" and then show that both the "restrict from field pair" and the "extend from ROI pair" are "compatible". That would give the most flexible API, I think.</p>

<p>Perhaps with a suitable predicate and dot-notation, it wouldn't even be very verbose to work with.</p>

<p>But one might need 4 choose 2 definitions?</p>

<p>I guess the alternative is that you pick one defn, develop the API in terms of that defn, and after 2500 lines of code you discover that the maths forces some of the other definitions on you as well. And then you get ugly proofs because the API doesn't apply smoothly.</p>

<p>So I don't really have any intuition as to what will lead to a better API, so I'll leave that to the experts. But related to the unit lemma. I realise now that maybe we don't need to have <code>element_is_real</code> in the statement and that its probably enough to use  that its an element fixed by <code>gal_conj p</code>. I'll have a closer look at the proof to make sure this is the case. But it might make the proof a tad nicer (but probably doesn't help with the main issue of Galois acting on all of these structures).</p>

<p>Regarding the problem in general, we ran into this when doing stuff from Atiyah-MacDonald. An issue one will have is that if you try to use bundled subobjects then you run into the problem that the unit group is both a subgroup of the integer ring and the number field. In comm alg in the example I'm thinking of we just made everything into a type (ie in this case the unit group is a group not a subgroup) and we used <code>is_scalar_tower</code> to keep track of the (analogue of the) compatibilities units -&gt; integer ring -&gt; number field</p>

<p>(we had A subring B subring C but I'm extrapolating what worked for us)</p>

<p>Note that if you use the <code>is_scalar_tower</code> approach then the emphasis moves from the maps R -&gt; K, U -&gt; K etc to the actions of R on K, U on K etc, and you recover the maps by acting on 1: all the four objects in question (roots of unity, units, integers, field) have got a 1.</p>

<p>I'm having trouble working on the <code>number_theory/cyclotomic/rat.lean</code> file. It seems to be using up all of my ram (and the same is happening on gitpod). I tried doing <code>leanproject build</code> (after doing <code>get-mathlib-cache</code>) or <code>lean -- make my_file</code> and also tried splitting some of the content into another file but its still not working. Any ideas on how to fix this?</p>

<p>So I split the unit lemma into a new file and it seems to not use up all of my ram now. I'm just playing around with this to see if some quick coe lemmas can at least prove more of it (before trying to do Kevin's suggestion of using <code>scalar_towers</code> which sounds a bit scary to me at the moment)</p>
