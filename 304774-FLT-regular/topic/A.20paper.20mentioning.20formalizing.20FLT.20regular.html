<p>I just stumbled across a master thesis that talks about the prospect of formalizing FLT regular in 2010! <a href="https://scholarworks.calstate.edu/downloads/3b591917r">https://scholarworks.calstate.edu/downloads/3b591917r</a> I don't think they did any formalization work, but just tried to give explicit proofs of some components, nevertheless quite funny that this has been on peoples minds for so long</p>

<p>It seems to only discuss case I, that is very natural once one have (as we do) unique factorization of ideals!</p>

<p>BTW I will resume working on the project tomorrow, I think we can finish case I pretty quickly now</p>

<p>Yeah hopefully case 1 is close. I should be able to get back to this in a couple of weeks. But my plan was to also start planning out a strategy for case 2 (or at least put some more details in the blueprint)</p>
