<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="513540">@Flo</span> !  Fubini's theorem is already in Lean in fact.  So you could try the Gaussian integrals step.</p>

<p>In general, relatively to the math difficulty, computations tend to be harder to formalize than abstract stuff imo. But the aim is definitely to make enough API to make theorems usable in practice</p>

<p>I looked at the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/algebraic_geometry/EllipticCurve.html">elliptic curve part of mathlib</a> and was surprised to see very little there. Would it be reasonable to try to pursue formalizing the basics of elliptic curves over fields (i.e. the classical setting as in Silverman's AEC)? Is it essential to build things up for general rings first? Are there significant obstructions that the experts have thought through?</p>

<p>The general recommendation is that even if you want to do it over fields, you should write each theorem and definition with the weakest assumptions for which it still typechecks</p>

<p>that does not mean you have to actually properly engage with what an elliptic curve over a semiring should mean - if a theorem of interest isn't true in that generality then just add more hypotheses to bring it back to sanity</p>

<p>(but working out what these things actually do mean in weirdly general settings is a popular pastime when doing this kind of formalization, because the question, once asked, begs for an answer)</p>

<p>I would happily try and lead a project on etale cohomology. I think the starting point is etale morphisms of rings. I think that this project should be relatively straightforward if a student who knew or wanted to learn the theory of etale morphisms of rings explained e.g. I think in Freitag-Kiehl. Apparently I'm giving a talk on algebraic geometry on Friday so I could just talk about that if we got anywhere.</p>
<p>My student Amelia Livingston (who doesn't use Zulip much) has been doing group and Galois cohomology (Sebastian Monnet made the Krull topology on an infinite Galois group) so etale cohomology is a very nice next step and it's probably in scope.</p>

<p>After making a robust API for etale morphisms of rings the challenge would be to globalize it so that you can get a definition of an etale morphism of schemes.</p>

<p>The pull request <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/15276">#15276</a> contains the current definition of covering spaces. The next (hard!) thing is to prove homotopy lifting. But proving other basic properties would be appreciated.</p>
