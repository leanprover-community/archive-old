<p>For a monoid R (e.g. a commutative ring) we have the monoid <code>associates R</code>, the quotient of <code>R</code> by <code>units R</code>, and this is preordered in mathlib by divisibility. For a commutative ring we have the semiring <code>ideal R</code> of ideals. This we have.</p>
<p>There's a natural map from <code>associates R</code> to <code>ideal R</code> and if R is an integral domain then this map is injective and, unfortunately, order-reversing (3 divides 6, but the ideal (6) is a subset of the ideal (3)). Do we have this map? If not then I would appreciate advice on whether it should just go from <code>associates R</code> to <code>ideal R</code> or whether I should insert an <code>order_dual</code> somewhere. The bare map has the good monoid hom properties, but it inverts the ordering.  It would be much easier to say "this bare map satisfies x &lt;= y -&gt; f(y) &lt;= f(x)" than start putting monoid structures on order_dual X given one on X. More and more I am seeing instances of order-reversing maps as we push on with algebra in Lean. If R is a PID then this map is simultaneously an isomorphism of monoids and an anti-isomorphism of orders.</p>
