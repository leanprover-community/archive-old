<p>What is the current progress towards the prime number theorem, or a weaker sense, the Mertens formula in Lean?</p>

<p>I would be inclined to use <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span>'s deep embedding of metamath into Lean. Not sure how we might/would/should want to tie that to mathlib. I personally would be in favour of a <code>src/binary/</code> folder where we can dump those deep embeddings, and a subfolder <code>src/binary/align</code> that aligns stuff with the rest of mathlib. And then just transport metamath's PNT to Lean.</p>

<p>What's more, parsing Metamath proofs are ratherly easy (I ever have written a parser, but remain unpublished), and the only difficulty is to convert Metamath "axioms" into Lean definitions. In contrast, it's harder to get Isabelle proof terms.</p>

<p>While I take a maximalist view of what's appropriate for mathlib (pretty much anything that could be considered known mathematics, from the mathematical sciences as a whole, is appropriate for mathlib or the mathlib archive if properly integrated with mathlib and following its coding standards, with the choice between mathlib and the mathlib archive being based on whether the material is likely to be reused or is very specific to a given result) - so that, for example, various projects people have done to prove some result or develop some theory outside of mathlib ought to end up in mathlib - this sort of proof converted from Metamath via a deep embedding is one of the things that seems less suitable to me (and likewise anything involving a large amount of auto-generated code not suitable for editing and maintaining by hand). The main benefit of PNT in Lean, as with many big results, would probably be the theory and lemmas developed to prove it rather than the result itself (although certainly the result itself is useful), and you don't get that benefit with such a proof converted from Metamath.</p>

<p>I do think there is a gap here, where we don't have any process for making use of external proofs similar to FFI in programming languages. Especially big formalization projects can't always be done in one system due to organizational constraints - Flyspeck being one famous example, being written in HOL light and Isabelle - and I think we should work on having seamless integration between libraries. I don't think that we should be literally checking in a copy of <a href="http://translated-set.mm">translated-set.mm</a> to mathlib, that would not fit our development model at all, but we should be able to depend on <a href="http://translated-set.mm">translated-set.mm</a> for formalizations.</p>

<p>Of course. But maybe you are building a proof of something else and want to have PNT as a dependency without going into the details of the proof because they aren't relevant.</p>

<p>I actually agree with this (despite being the original author of the metamath PNT proof). I think it would be more on-point for mathlib to formalize the abstract nonsense proof of PNT because it has better connections to other parts of abstract number theory which are of research interest. A proof of the PNT on it's own just isn't that much of an achievement anymore and the Erdos-Selberg proof won't pay many other dividends than PNT itself.</p>

<p>I've never heard of complex analysis being described as "abstract nonsense" before! But I think we are all in agreement here that a Riemann-zeta-based proof written directly in Lean would be preferable over either (a) a proof via Erdos--Selberg, or (b) an incomprehensible hairball autotranslated from some other system (at which point it hardly matters what argument was used in the other system originally).</p>

<p>as ever, I will reject the claim that the proof is incomprehensible though. It is actually a pretty direct translation of the original code, it would not be that bad to make it as presentable as the original proof</p>

<p>I'm sorry, I meant no slight on your work (either the original achievement of proving PNT in Metamath, or that of writing the Metamath-to-Lean translator, both of which are pretty cool.)</p>

<p>But I think we are not so far from being able to prove PNT directly. with the classical O(exp(sqrt log x)) error term, in mathlib. This is one of the motivations for the work that Meow and I have been doing to prove analytic continuation of Riemann zeta.</p>

<p>By the way, I don't regard Lean as the "best" tool for formalizing all mathematics. Some statements in mathematical logic may be more suitable to be formalized in Isabelle? Isabelle has two levels of logic, meta-level and object-level. In Isabelle we have many object-logics, for example, LCF, modal logic and sequent calculus.</p>

<p>But CIC can also be used as a meta-logic, similar to Isabelle/Pure. That's what <code>model_theory</code> do.</p>
