<p>If you did not find this, the argument below might be quick given what is in mathlib.</p>
<p>Suppose that <code>f * g = 0</code>.  Invert the leading coefficient of <code>g</code>, and use that if the leading coefficient of a polynomial is a unit, then multiplying by the polynomial only maps to zero the zero polynomial.  Thus, <code>f</code> is the zero polynomial in the localisation.  It follows that a power of the leading coefficient of <code>g</code> annihilates <code>f</code>.</p>
<p>I believe that most of the steps are in place.  However, I am not sure how painful it is to relate inverting the leading coefficient in the ground ring or in a polynomial ring over it.</p>
