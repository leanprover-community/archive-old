<p>We are considering the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riesz%E2%80%93Markov%E2%80%93Kakutani_representation_theorem">Riesz-Markov-Kakutani representation theorem</a> (probably following Rudin's <em>Real and Complex Analysis</em>) as a topic for a summer intern. Although the primary goal is to have a topic for a summer project and not necessarily directly contribute to mathlib (we can decide about that later), I think it is nicer to choose a topic that doesn't obviously duplicate work (especially by experts). So: is anyone working / planning to work on that now or during the summer?</p>
<p>One implementation choice that I will suggest is to treat <code>nnreal</code>-valued functions first (the "positive linear functional" part is then naturally baked in, and the measures are usual <code>ennreal</code>-valued measures) and only later extend to real-valued functions and signed measures. This is inspired by how <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/measure_theory.finite_measure.topological_space">docs#measure_theory.finite_measure.topological_space</a> was done following Heather's suggestion (I realize that I have not yet PR'd the pairing with real-valued functions there, but I will, soon). Comments are of course welcome! And we'd keep asking questions here <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span>.</p>

<p>That sounds like a great project, I for one would be very happy to see this in mathlib!</p>
