<p>Hi, I'm new to both Lean and Tulip.  I just watched Kevin Buzzard's great ICM talk, and am wondering: does the library contain any materials on Exterior Differential Systems?</p>

<p>From nLab: "The existing literature on exterior differential systems is actually a bit unclear about which additional assumptions on J are supposed to be a crucial part of the definition. " :-) Humans had better make sure they know a definition before computers have a chance to understand it! But I think the answer to your question is "no" -- we have manifolds but very little more, we are still working on de Rham cohomology and differentials, for example. These things are do-able, it's just a case of people doing it.</p>

<p>Many thanks.  I'm interested in learning more.  Do you know of anyone at Duke U (or in North Carolina) with experience with one of these formal theorem proving systems?</p>

<p>I don't think we have anyone from Duke yet. You are very welcome to become the first one!</p>

<p>It's funny because when I read your first message mentioning exterior differential systems I thought it would be nice to have Bryant joining us since he is already very active on mathoverflow. I guess EDS theory is very active at Duke.</p>

<p>I'm in the US the upcoming week. So there should be two weeks left after that.</p>
