<p>I am looking for results about (real) lattices as used in the geometry of numbers, that is discrete subgroups of ℝ^n with applications to algebraic number theory in view. I see that Minkowski's theorem <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/2819">#2819</a>  in closed to being added to <code>mathlib</code> so having lattices too could be very useful. For obvious reasons, doing a search for <code>lattice</code> in the docs is not very helpful <span aria-label="wink" class="emoji emoji-1f609" role="img" title="wink">:wink:</span></p>

<p><a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/submodule">docs#submodule</a> is what you want. <code>submodule int E</code> is the type of lattices in the space <code>E</code>.</p>

<p>It's much bigger than the type of lattices in E, at least for the traditional number theorists use of the word "lattice" as a discrete cocompact subgroup.</p>

<p>Yes, I know that but what I am looking for are results about those. Mainly, things like the proof that a discrete subgroup of ℝ^n is a free ℤ-module of the same rank as the vector space it spans. I have some code to do that but I thought it might be there already.</p>
