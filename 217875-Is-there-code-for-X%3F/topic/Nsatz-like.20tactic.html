<p>In the course of my <a href="https://github.com/BoltonBailey/formal_baby_snark">project</a> I have reached a point where I have a goal and a collection of equations that take the form of equations of polynomials over an integral domain. After searching a bit I found <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/refman/addendum/nsatz.html">Nsatz</a>, a Coq tactic that seems to do this sort of thing. I am not too familiar with the Nullstellensatz, but I see there is a file on it in mathlib. Does something like the Nsatz tactic exist for Lean? Does anyone have thoughts on how easily this algorithm could be implemented based on what already does exist?</p>

<p>Looking briefly at the link you sent, it seems this tactic does a Gr√∂bner basis calculation. Unfortunately we don't have such a tactic as far as I know.</p>

<p>MS have got their eye on adding this in Lean 4 but we're unlikely to get it in Lean 3</p>
