<p>Is there a tactic that does what is usually meant by wlog in math papers? More precisely, assuming the goal is to show some property of a function <code>f</code>, saying <code>suffices (f 0 = 0) generalizing f</code> would split the situation into</p>
<ul>
<li>the current one with the additional assumption <code>f 0 = 0</code></li>
<li>a new situation with an additional assumption saying "for every function with <code>g 0 = 0</code> plus all the other assumptions on <code>f</code> transported into assumptions on <code>g</code>, the corresponding goal holds" (and then your job is to massage <code>f</code> into <code>g</code> satisfying the assumption and use the lemma).</li>
</ul>
<p>So, something a little bit similar to <code>suffices</code> but that would generate an intermediate lemma. I'm guessing that this can be done using a mixture of <code>suffices</code> and <code>revert</code>, and of course when the separate lemma is of more general use it is always possible to state it explicitly, but it would be useful as a standalone tactic.</p>

<p>I'd like to get one version or the other into mathlib for sure!</p>

<p>Ah, thanks, I had missed that thread and indeed <code>wlog'</code> described there does what I am asking for, it I understand it right. I will try to give it a try...</p>

<p>... yep, that's exactly what I had in mind. It would certainly be useful to have it in mathlib!</p>
