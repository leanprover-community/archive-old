<p>Do we have that subsequences of a cauchy sequence are themselves cauchy, and <code>equiv</code> to the original sequence? There's stuff about subsequences in <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/cauchy">docs#cauchy</a>, but that file seems to be about a more general idea of cauchy that I can't understand at my level, and I don't know if it shows anything relevant relevant to the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/cau_seq">docs#cau_seq</a> defined in data.real which is what I'm interested in.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="364484">@Deniz Aydin</span> Can you say a little more about what you want this for?  There might be a more high-powered way of doing your application that you wouldn't have to fight the library for.</p>

<p>By equiv do you mean <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/asymptotics.is_equivalent">docs#asymptotics.is_equivalent</a> ? If so, then I don't think your lemma exists. If you really need it I can work on that tomorrow.</p>

<p>Also, the right notion of Cauchy sequence is almost surely <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/cauchy_seq">docs#cauchy_seq</a>.</p>

<p>And if you want to go back to the usual definition on a metric space, the right lemma is <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/metric.cauchy_seq_iff">docs#metric.cauchy_seq_iff</a></p>

<p>Heather's probably right that I don't need this lemma, it just seemed like the obvious way for me to show that a certain sequence is cauchy but I'm sure I can do it directly. Regardless I should have been clearer, by cauchy and equiv I do in fact mean the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/cau_seq.equiv">docs#cau_seq.equiv</a> definition in data.real, which is the only one I knew existed until I started searching for this lemma. As far as I can tell the version you're linking is totally independent of this one which I find strange but I'm sure there's a reason.<br>
If you're curious why I care about this version, I'm working with base b expansions of real numbers building on one of <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span>'s experiments, and from a sequence of digits I get a real number using the cauchy sequence of summing up just the first n digits of the number. I've almost shown that this is the inverse of the map he defined <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/digits/src/data/real/digits1.lean#L34">here</a>.</p>

<p>Yeah I just realized that asymptotic equivalence is not what you meant because it makes the statement trivially false <span aria-label="face palm" class="emoji emoji-1f926" role="img" title="face palm">:face_palm:</span></p>

<p><a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/cau_seq">docs#cau_seq</a> is a low level tool used to build the real numbers, and in a prefect world you shouldn't have to use it at all after proving everything you need about reals. <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/cauchy_seq">docs#cauchy_seq</a> is a much more general (and a bit more obscure at first) version of this which is better suited for abstract results.</p>

<p>In your case, it may be easier to use either :</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/cauchy_seq">docs#cauchy_seq</a> + <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/cauchy_seq_tendsto_of_is_complete">docs#cauchy_seq_tendsto_of_is_complete</a> to get the limit</li>

<p>I liked the idea of using <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/cau_seq">docs#cau_seq</a> because it feels like the natural way to get a real number from a sequence af rational numbers was to go straight through the definition, that way I wouldn't have to cast rationals to reals though it probably doesn't make much difference in practice. Thanks for the advice, I may try express things in terms of <code>tsum</code> at some point though I'll have to do a lot of lemma hunting.</p>
