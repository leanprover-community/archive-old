<p>When I think about the set of natural numbers its icon in my mind's file system looks something like this: <code>{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}</code>.<br>
When I think about the set of integers its icon looks something like this: <code>{..., -3, -2 -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}</code>.</p>
<p>Is there an easy way to ask Lean to do the same -- to generate a few "nice" elements of a set and show them to me so that I can picture the set better? I would like to apply this to see what the elements of the <code>2â„¤</code> ideal that I have defined look like.</p>

<p>I've been thinking a while ago that it would be nice to have "examples" of terms in given types. And tactics could try to combine those.</p>

<p>But we don't have any framework for this atm.<br>
(Note that <code>example</code> is not the kind of thing I was thinking of.)</p>

<p>Potentially if you provided a decidable instance for being in the ideal, then there is a proof that the integers are enumerable and that subsets of enumerable types are enumerable so you could use that to show you some elements.</p>

<p>Sorry, I don't understand "a decidable instance for being in the ideal".</p>

<p>It means that you need to write an algorithm that decides whether a given integer is element of the ideal.</p>

<p>This sounds kind of like quickcheck, which uses typeclasses for generating representative elements of a variety of types</p>
