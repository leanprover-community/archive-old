<p>Do we have congruent triangles in matlib? Most proofs in Euclidean geometry are in vectors and I am thinking of writing about congruent and similar triangles and prove some theorems.</p>
<p>Also,  although I can prove, for example, SAS using vectors and law of cosines etc., I am thinking of including a Euclidean style proof there. He proved SAS by moving the triangles so that they overlap. I can prove that by introducing translation, rotation and symmetry as conformal isometries (do we have that in matlib?) and then replicating Euclid's proof.</p>

<p>The most specialized kind of isometry available in mathlib is <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/linear_isometry">docs#linear_isometry</a>.

<p>I might be considering too naively. I understand congruence of figures should be defined with isometries and rigid motions, but for triangles isn't it more efficient to just use vectors and eg law of cosines to "solve" them (this way is no longer "Euclidean" though). For example, two triangles satisfying SAS are the same as we can solve for all other angles and sides given only the lengths of the two sides and the angle between them.</p>

<p>doing geometry: I didn't try yet :-( -- right now I seem to be very inefficiently trying to work on about 10 projects all of which have been hanging over since term started (it's just finished last Friday). I'm thinking that this sort of mathematics might be interesting for (a) a summer project or (b) a school talk so I'll chase it up in the end.</p>

<p>A principle followed in mathlib is to state and prove results with the weakest assumptions that make sense. A <code>triangle</code> bundles three affinely independent points. But neither "three" or "affinely independent" is needed at all for results on congruence, so those results aren't really about triangles at all, they've about indexed families and should be stated and proved accordingly (unless the triangle result is actually needed separately to derive the arbitrary-dimension result, but I don't think it is).</p>
<p>You could, for example, probably derive the result (a) from my previous comment using <code>inner_weighted_vsub</code> to show that a subfamily of points in one family is affinely independent iff and only if the corresponding subfamily of points in the other family (with the same pairwise distances) is, and proving further lemmas that apply to any affine space (over a vector space) to deduce the dimension property from that. Then for (b) you might define some concrete isometries that you use in an induction step, to go from an isometric equivalence mapping corresponding points in an affine subspace to one that makes corresponding points in a larger affine subspace match as well. Once you have SSS congruence in such a general form for indexed families of points, you could deduce SAS congruence (i.e. if all distances from a single point in the family, and all angles at that point, match in the two families, then you have congruence under the same conditions as before), because knowing the distances and angles at one point in the family immediately gives you all the other pairwise distances. Again, the result being proved is not restricted at all to triangles (although you may have used the law of cosines to determine the other pairwise distances from the distances and angles at one point).</p>
