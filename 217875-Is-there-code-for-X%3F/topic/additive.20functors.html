<p>Does the abelian categories part of mathlib have something about additive functors? I can't even find a definition.</p>

<p>None that I know of - <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> would know better than I though. If I remember correctly, the idea was to define enriched categories and functors of those first, and deduce additive functors from these? Also I think there was a student of <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span>, who was interested in this too</p>

<p>Exactly right --- my dissatisfaction with all my attempts at enriched categories has held up other things. Perfect being the enemy of best, I think we should just do additive functors.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> we're you thinking of defining additive categories (preabelian?) categories as categories enriched over Ab?</p>

<p>preadditive I guess is the term for enriched-over-Ab</p>

<p>I seem to have forgotten where I got up to with enriched categories. It was pretty unsatisfactory.</p>
