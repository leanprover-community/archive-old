<p>Are there any lemmas which assert convergence but don't go as far to require exactly where a sequence converges? I would expect these kinds of lemmas to be named like <code>exists_tendsto</code>, but I can't find any. (In this case <code>c</code> is equal to <code>sqrt 2 * \pi</code>, but I can't prove it directly.)</p>

<p>What's your maths proof that this sequence converges? Lean doesn't do magic. This is equivalent to some weak form of Stirling's formula.</p>

<p>Take the log of the sequence and set <code>d_n = log n! - (n + 1/2 ) * log n + n</code>. Then you bound <code>d_n - d_{n + 1}</code> by <code>1 / 12 n</code> by truncating its taylor series.  So <code>d_n</code> is decreasing but <code>d_n - 1 / 12 n</code> is increasing; hence it must converge to some <code>c</code>. </p>

<p>So then that's the proof that you have to formalise. What's your question exactly?</p>

<p>I wanted to ask because I feel like some helpful results about convergence should have already been formalized. And on second thought, I'm kind of just stuck on how to write out the details in Lean... I guess that isn't really a question.</p>

<p>I think you might be better off starting to formalise the proof and then coming up with a precise question. Things like "a decreasing bounded-below sequence tends to a limit" are going to be in there somewhere but you have a journey to go on before that result is useful to you.</p>

<p>Ok, thanks. I'll probably have real questions after I iron out the details. Back to coding I go. <span aria-label="upside down" class="emoji emoji-1f643" role="img" title="upside down">:upside_down:</span></p>
