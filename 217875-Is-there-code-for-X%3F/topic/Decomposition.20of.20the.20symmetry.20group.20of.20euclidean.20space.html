<p>Is there any theorem stating that the symmetry group of euclidean space (as a metric space) can be decomposed into translations, rotations and reflections?<br>
And, is there theorem stating that isometries of euclidean space are diffeomorphisms? Maybe this should be a theorem in Riemannian geometry, which is not yet formalized in mathlib as far as I know.</p>

<p>I think in both cases the answer is "nope, we don't have it"</p>

<p>But certainly (1) should be well within reach.</p>
