<p>This is a basic question, so I already apologize for probably missing something fundamental. <br>
Suppose that in a tactic block, I have a definition of the form <br>
'let g:= ...'<br>
and that my goal explicitly involves g. Is it possible to change the goal by substituting the definition of g (doing a zeta reduction)? The only way I see how to do this is by calling 'simp only [g],' but I'd hope that it wouldn't be necessary to invoke the simplifier, both since it seems more costly and since it might do some additional simplification. <br>
The same question came up for beta reduction: Suppose that 'f' is a function, and that my goal involves '(Î» x, f x) y'. What is the best way to explicitly modify this term to f y in the goal?</p>
