<p>For a little while now I've been looking at the implementation of the mathematics necessary to implement the constructions of code-based cryptography (and so necessarily coding theory and specifically linear codes). I wanted to check what specific to this we already had in mathlib. As far as I can tell, not lots?</p>

<p>(It feels like it would be substantially easier to focus on linear codes or at the least fixed-length codes rather than general coding theory.)</p>

<p>I've been thinking again about this. The standard definition of a linear code of length n and dimension k is a k-dimensional subspace over n-tuples of a finite field. But I'm not quite sure of the best way to define that as a type.</p>

<p>You can also define it as the image of a matrix of rank k from k-tuples to n-tuples, and I guess this is also true over rings instead of a field which comes up in some applications.</p>

<p>If you only care about the subspace and not the basis then why not just encode it as a pair consisting of a term of type <code>submodule F (fin n -&gt; F)</code> and a proof that the term has dimension <code>k</code>? Are you sure you want <code>k</code> to be part of the data?</p>

<p>Because I'm not clear on your applications I don't know if you want <code>code F</code> or <code>code F n</code> or <code>code F n k</code>. If you have <code>C : code F</code> then you can have <code>C.length : nat</code> and <code>C.dimension : nat</code>. If you have <code>C : code F n k</code> then different things become easier/harder. Mathematically it's "all the same", so perhaps the definition should be informed by what you want to do with these things. For example would it be convenient if two codes with different dimensions have the same type, for some reason, or does this buy you nothing? It all depends on what you're doing I guess.</p>

<p>I'm not an expert, but my reading of your screenshot is "choose a basis (b1,...,bk) and (c1,...,ck) for your two codes, and then the space spanned by basis (b1,c1),...,(bk,ck) is the diagonal concatenation", and this will clearly change if you change your basis.</p>

<p>OK so now you have introduced what look like three distinct concepts to me: (1) a subspace of F^n of dimension k (2) a subspace of F^n of dimension k equipped with a basis (3) a subspace of F^n of dimension k except that two subspaces are thought of as equal if they are equivalent in the sense of some kind of  linear isometry. Only one of these can be a <code>code</code> I guess. Do you want a <code>based_code</code> as well?</p>

<p>A generator matrix is just another way of thinking about a basis; you can't make that diagonal concatenation construction without having one though. So why not let <code>code n k</code> be a k-dimensional subspace of <code>fin n -&gt; F</code>, and then mimic the <code>basis</code> API in mathlib to do generator matrices?</p>

<p>I am a fool -- of course "isometry" will preserve distances. I would just make some random design decision and then get going. Start with <code>code n k</code> being a structure with two fields, the submodule and the proof it's got dimension k, and then try making examples and proving lemmas about them; you'll soon find out whether you've made the right decision.</p>

<p>I think that this might reflect my formalisation technique, and I'm well aware that there are others that do things very differently. For example I had no idea about the "best" way to formalise schemes, but rather than spend any time trying to figure it out I just tried a random way with a couple of undergrads and we learnt from my mistakes. It took three goes to get it right. The same is happening with group cohomology right now, with a debate still running (search for recent posts by Amelia Livingston) about what the correct definition is, but I already supervised not one but two projects (one bachelors, one masters) both of which claimed to define group cohomology! I firmly believe in a "try something and see" approach.</p>

<p>if "finrank F C = k" is the "right" choice I can work with that but my experience is definitely that there's a lot of pitfalls one can make, and I can think of several other definitions that might also work fine</p>

<p>I think it's definitely morally the right choice, because you know a priori that the subspace is finite-dimensional. However there's a world of difference between that assertion and "I have all the API I need" :-) If you're missing API then you could try and farm it out, or just sorry it.</p>

<p>Fwiw, there is a close connection to matroid theory here (codes are ‘represented matroids’, where the represented matroid is the one whose independent sets are the lin. Ind. sets of columns in the parity check matrix) and the matroid probably wants to have the dimension after the colon.</p>

<p>A matroid is an abstract system of ‘independent sets’ in a type, and when linearly represented, matroids are essentially linear codes. See Alena’s talk or mine on the same topic from Lean Together last year (on mobile - don’t have the link handy).</p>
<p>My view on the colon makes sense even for codes though - because of the finite dimensionality, there is a canonical correspondence between a code and the dual of its dual.

<p>I meant that I much prefer <code>linear_code (n : nat) := (...)</code>, where the dimension <code>d</code> is either a field of the definition or a function of the code defined externally, to <code>linear_code (n d : nat)</code> where the dimension <code>d</code> is tied up before the colon. This is because a <code>linear_code 6 2</code> isn't propeq to the dual dual code, a <code>linear_code 6 (6-(6-2))</code>, where they really are 'the same' mathematically. (Obviously we make sacrifices like that all the time with things like order duality, but here it might not be necessary at all)</p>

<p>I like this. The reason I wasn't necessarily going to do it is that a) I thought it might make associating it with a generator/parity-check matrix harder (but I take your point re: types), b) there are operations on codes which seem to only work for codes of the same dimension.</p>

<p>One option would be to have two (three?) different types: <code>linear_code n</code>, which is the type of linear codes of length n, and <code>linear_code_generated by n k</code>, which has a field G (where G is an k by n matrix) and a proof that G has full rank, or whatever and we understand that to mean the linear code generated by a given generator matrix (and I suppose you could have a similar thing for parity matrices).</p>

<p>Yeah, I don’t know much about the operations that care about the dimension - maybe that’s where the tradeoffs lie.</p>
<p>It seems natural to me to have the generator matrix -&gt; code construction be a function, rather than having the matrix as a field, since that way, you can meaningfully state that <code>code_generated_by A = code_generated_by B</code> for distinct matrices A and B, rather than having that statement fail to typecheck. </p>
<p>Does the matrix need to have full row rank? I know it’s conventional, but taking the row space of an arbitrary matrix as the code it generates works fine enough. If you want to talk about full-rank generators, you can always use that later.</p>
<p>I don’t know enough about the design goals to say anything sensible about metrics.</p>

<p>But because I would want to use the Hamming metric at least some of the time, I might want the vector space which is "n-tuples with the Hamming metric", because it isn't going to be correct to define the Hamming metric for all n-tuples (sometimes you want other metrics!)</p>
