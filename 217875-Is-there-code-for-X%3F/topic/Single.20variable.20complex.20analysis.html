<p>Hi, I am fourth year undergraduate studying Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. As my final year project, I decided to contribute to mathlib and so far I've enjoyed learning how to use Lean. From the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad_todo.html">undergrad math not in mathlib</a> I see that barely any of the complex analysis undergraduate curriculum is formalized. I was wondering whether somebody has tried formalizing this before or, if not, why?</p>

<p>Well, we have the complex numbers as a field, but I'm not sure that anyone has developed the theory of complex analysis. It is definitely worth talking about this. I used to understand the situation with one-variable real analysis well: the argument was that there was no point developing it directly because at some point one would have to do multivariable real analysis. A lot of stuff has since been done, including, I believe, the fundamental theorem of calculus, so one might naively feel that we are in some sense ready to start complex analysis. I might be wrong though.</p>

<p>It will almost certainly not be possible to automatically translate any code over, because if this were a thing then it would have been done way before now to translate other stuff over. The filter stuff from topology was I think all taken from Isabelle, but all ported manually.</p>

<p>i don't really see why it wouldn't be possible. at least to have it work in conjunction with a human programmer. a lot of the computer language translation stuff will be like, the computer does 95% of the work, but some structures don't quite map and you have to deal with that manually</p>

<p>Talking of translations and Freek 100, one could argue that once we have uniqueness of the reals proved we could in theory translate the metamath proof of PNT (that's a Freek question, right?) into Lean -- but of course the code would be unreadable and not appropriate for mathlib.</p>

<p>Java2python and similar tools rely on the existence of an AST representation of the underlying language, and a specifically built translation mechanism. Both java and python are similar in that they're bytecode based languages too, and have very mature interpreters, and many variants (jvm languages for java, ironpython, pypy etc for python)</p>

<p>Independent of this issue (for which the answer is surely ultimately going to be "if you want complex analysis from Isabelle then feel free to manually port") there's the question of whether we're ready to start on this at all. I was trying to say that 2 years ago I had a clear understanding of why I shouldn't be persuading undergraduates to formalise their 1st year real analysis course for mathlib ("it's not general enough"), but now I have a far poorer understanding of whether I should be persuading undergraduates to formalise their 2nd year complex analysis course.</p>

<p>Mathematically I think the issue is the following. One needs to have a good theory of polynomials in one variable to develop some of the theory of polynomials in a finite set of variables, because several of the foundational proofs use induction in the number of variables. Apparently it is less clear that one needs to have a good theory of one variable real analysis before one develops a multivariable theory, because that kind of interaction is perhaps not there so much. What is the story for complex analysis? Certainly a multivariable theory exists, but is it built on top of the one-variable theory or is the one-variable theory just a special case?</p>

<p>Of course there needs to be a specialised theory of integration etc in one dimension. But does it come next, or is there a ton of other stuff which ideally should be done first?</p>
<p>While we're here, someone might want to start thinking about the Jordan curve theorem I guess? Do we have enough to make this a feasible project? Or is the argument that we will only need it for e.g. rectifiable curves, which might be easier? I don't know the foundations of this stuff.</p>

<p>you don't need a Lean AST for this though - you really just need an AST for the other language. because you are free to generate Lean a much more restricted subset of Lean. i think the hardest thing though is that AFAICT some of the fundamental underlying datatypes are handled differently - like in metamath e.g. <a href="http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/areacirc.html">http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/areacirc.html</a> you have statements like <code>(𝑡 ∈ ℝ → 𝑡 ∈ ℂ)</code>. in Lean IIUC you can't represent that directly because the type system works differently. fundamental datatypes in e.g. java and python aren't compatible with each other either, but you at least have a mapping between the type hierarchy even if they don't quite work the same.</p>

<p>Why piece-wise continuous? How do you integrate on such a path? I think we only need manifolds with boundaries and corners here (this certainly covers triangles).</p>

<p>I think my concerns were unfounded. I was initially worried about whether one would need a manifold-like structure on the boundary itself (here a piecewise-smooth curve).  But I suppose what you are saying is that for a manifold with corners, one has stratification of the boundary into pieces which are genuine smooth manifolds, and so integration over the boundary can be defined neatly as a sum of integration over the pieces.</p>

<p>The approach in introductory texts, eg., Stein-Shakarchi, is to start with the very basic, like integrals over triangles, and see how much mileage one can get from that idea; amazingly, that little lemma can be whittled rather quickly (at least on the human level; we'll see about Lean) all the way up to Cauchy integral representations, analytic functions, etc. So the hope is to take Step 1, and do so now, without waiting for fancier things to be built...? (And also for me to learn more about how this all works...)</p>

<p>you don't need a Lean AST for this though - you really just need an AST for the other language. because you are free to generate Lean a much more restricted subset of Lean. i think the hardest thing though is that AFAICT some of the fundamental underlying datatypes are handled differently - like in metamath e.g. <a href="http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/areacirc.html">http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/areacirc.html</a> you have statements like <code>(𝑡 ∈ ℝ → 𝑡 ∈ ℂ)</code>. in Lean IIUC you can't represent that directly because the type system works differently. fundamental datatypes in e.g. java and python aren't compatible with each other either, but you at least have a mapping between the type hierarchy even if they don't quite work the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Translation from metamath is a "solved problem" at the technical level at this point. You can easily represent <code>(𝑡 ∈ ℝ → 𝑡 ∈ ℂ)</code> in lean, because lean knows about ZFC. It just says <code>t ∈ Real -&gt; t ∈ Complex</code> where <code>Real</code> and <code>Complex</code> have type <code>set Set</code>, that is, classes of ZFC</p>

<p>This is proving that <code>cℕ₀</code>, which is notation for metamath's <code>NN0</code> (natural numbers with zero), is isomorphic to <code>ℕ</code> (lean's <code>nat</code>), using metamath theorems <code>nn0ex</code> which says <code>cℕ₀</code> is a set, and <code>nn0ind'</code> which is one version of an induction theorem for nn0</p>
