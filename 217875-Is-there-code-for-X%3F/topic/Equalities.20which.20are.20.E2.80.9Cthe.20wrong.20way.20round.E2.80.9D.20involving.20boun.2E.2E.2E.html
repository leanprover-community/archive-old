<p>Hi all, this is a problem that has come up a few times and has resulted in what feels like unnecessary work. </p>
<p>I will have a goal of the form, say, $∃(x:A),…(c(x)=t)$ where $t$ may or may not have bound variables as well. I will have a term of type $∃(x:A),…(t=c(x))$. </p>
<p>Lean will not accept that that term means I have proved the theorem, which means I have to unwind it all, seemingly unnecessarily. I cannot use rw because $x$ is bound. I can’t seem to get simp_rw to work either, but maybe I am not feeding it the right type of theorem.</p>
<p>What is the generic solution to this problem?</p>

<p>When writing this, you can use <code>_</code> for the bound variables in <code>t</code>. You just have to specify one of the arguments of <code>eq_comm</code> enough so that it matches with <code>t</code>, but not with <code>c(x)</code> (or the other way around).</p>

<p>Should eq_comm take explicit arguments?</p>

<p>I think there is a whole bunch of basic propositional/predicate logic <code>iff</code>s that could use more explicit arguments. Examples:<br>
<a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/and.left_comm">docs#and.left_comm</a> <br>
<a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/imp.swap">docs#imp.swap</a><br>
I think explicit arguments are useful if the lemma might match multiple times, but you only want to rewrite some of them. An example of where I don't think the explicit argument is useful is <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/or_true">docs#or_true</a>, since I will want to rewrite all of them anyway (though I don't mind that the argument is explicit in this case).</p>

<p>The case for implicit arguments on <code>iff</code>s is less valid here, because we usually have one way lemmas with dot notation. So the only use for implicit arguments would be using in conjunction with <code>iff.trans</code> or similar, which is much rarer.</p>
