<p>So I've been slowly learning some lean by looking at the modular forms  code from Kevin Buzzard's birthday repo (here: <a href="https://github.com/semorrison/kbb/blob/master/src/modular_forms.lean">https://github.com/semorrison/kbb/blob/master/src/modular_forms.lean</a>) and getting it running again. Now I was thinking of going a bit further and trying to not just get the definition up and running but also Hecke operators and hopefully proving that Delta and some Eisenstein series are actually modular forms.  Ultimately proving something like multiplicty one would be great.  </p>
<p>Given I'm pretty new to this area, I wanted to check if  this has already been done/ is being done. I couldn't really find anything, but I also don't know exactly where to look.</p>

<p>I think we miss some complex analysis to do anything serious about modular forms</p>

<p>But it would be an amazing project</p>

<p>I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="260507">@Heather Macbeth</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="252920">@Alex Kontorovich</span> were working on modular forms or related things recently?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="130384">@Riccardo Brasca</span>  Yes well, I think anything with dimension formulas would be tough as  I'm guessing enough complex analysis or Riemann-Roch is still aways away.  I was just thinking about seeing how far one can get without them.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/modular3">branch#modular3</a> might be the latest. In the file number_theory/modular.lean</p>
