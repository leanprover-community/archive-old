<p>I'm a set theorist with essentially no background on lean.  I do work on permutation models, which are models of set theory with atoms.  Atoms/urelements can be elements of sets, but have no elements themselves.  To keep atoms from being equal to the empty set, extensionality must be weakened to only talk about non-atoms.  These are useful to show the independence of AC from the rest of ZF set thoery.</p>
<p>It doesn't look like the existing code for ZFC models is well equipped to talk about permutation models; or for that mater any interesting model of set theory not produced by just cutting the universe off at an inaccessible (like L).</p>
<p>Is implementing these a reasonable first project, or are there some major difficulties I don't see yet?</p>

<p>Have you heard about <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/con-nf/">the Con(NF) project</a>? This is in essence constructing a big permutation model.</p>

<p>I had not.  This does look interesting, although there is a sizable amount of mathematics I would need to learn before helping on this (ZFA models are much closer to classical set theory).</p>
