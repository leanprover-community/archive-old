<p>But we do have the Banach isomorphism theorem, so it should be pretty straightforward</p>

<p>I hope that the p-adic version is included because this is fundamental for nonarchimedean analysis. The only reference I know for the p-adic case is Bourbaki -- even Bosch-Guentzer-Remmert refer the reader to Bourbaki and it's essentially the only place where the book is not self-contained (unless you count references to exotic counterexamples which are not needed in the main arguments but which clarify what implies what).</p>

<p>Sure, the version where you start "let V be a Banach space over the reals or complexes. Then...". For many people, Banach space := Banach space over the reals or complexes. I have a fear of <code>is_R_or_C</code>. Where is <code>is_R_or_C_or_p-adic</code>? ;-)</p>

<p>Is there a case where you really want one of those three? I mean, most of the time don't you just want <code>nondiscrete_normed_field</code> and <code>complete_space</code>?</p>

<p><code>is_R_or_C_or_p-adic or is_R_or_p-adic</code> are <em>precisely</em> the possibilities for the completions of a number field.

The reals and complexes, or, more precisely, normed fields which are isomorphic to the complexes (sometimes we don't know which way is up) are sometimes called local fields or archimedean local fields, but some authors use local field to mean nonarchimedean local field. Some proofs really do really on the nonarchimedean property of the norm. And then there's the issue that some people allow nonarch local fields with infinite residue field and others don't, depending on whether they're doing something geometric (where it often doesn't matter) or arithmetic (where it can be crucial). Langlands goes out of his way to make "unified" statements whenever he can, including the reals, p-adics, and characteristic p local fields, and their finite extensions, but often in the proofs you split into cases depending on whether the norm is nonarchimedean or not. It's a bit of a mess :-/ In nonarchimedean analysis we care much less about finiteness of residue field and then the situation is much closer to what you describe, typically you just need completeness and the existence of an element of norm strictly between 0 and 1 so you can scale. The open mapping theorem comes under that category because it's analytic rather than arithmetic.</p>

<p>The main theorem in this PR (<code>linear_map.continuous_of_is_closed_graph</code>) is quite slow to compile, and I can't understand why (heavy rfl maybe ?) so if anyone wants to have a look that would be great</p>
