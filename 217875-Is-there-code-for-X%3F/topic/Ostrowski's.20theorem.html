<p>Do we have Ostrowski's theorem for p-adic/archimedean(/trivial) norms? Seems like low-hanging fruit, but I didn't see it in mathlib...? Thanks!</p>

<p>Someone did it a while ago, but it never made it to mathlib as far as I know. I don't remember where it was (it was some separate repo on github)</p>

<p>Yeah, we are currently working on Ostrowski theorem for rationals and rational function field. Rationals are almost done and we have started to PR some of the results.

<p>That's great, I'd love help! I'm really unsure of how much I can get through, even before I try adding Lean to the mix. The course is for ≥2nd year PhD students who haven't seen p-adic numbers before, and I was (very ambitiously) hoping to cover Tate's thesis (just over Q, doing adelic Poisson summation and functional equation for zeta and Dirichlet L-functions), followed by Gelfand-Graev-PS (that is, adelic automorphic representations on GL(2), again just over Q). I had in mind for the first lecture to prove Ostrowski, which is very fun, and to me "explains" why there're the reals and p-adics and nothing else. But then I was shocked that even that's not in mathlib (yet). I suppose I'll experiment with whether trying to formalize live (with lots of <code>sorry</code>s everywhere) turns out to be a terrifically bad idea... I might abandon the experiment after a lecture or two and reach for the safety blanket of the blackboard...</p>
