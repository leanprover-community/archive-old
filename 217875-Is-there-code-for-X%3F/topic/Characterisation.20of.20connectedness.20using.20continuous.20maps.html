<p>Consider the following theorem: </p>
<p>Let X be a topological space and A a nonempty subset of X. Then A is connected if and only if every continuous map to a discrete space is constant on A.</p>
<p>Is it somewhere in mathlib? I couldn't find it in topology/connected.lean but maybe I'm overlooking something. </p>
<p>Anyway, if it's not in mathlib I would like to contribute my proof. My current version, which needs to be cleaned up quite a lot before I can contribute it to mathlib, can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/dagurtomas/nobelings-thm/blob/master/src/connected_characterisation.lean">https://github.com/dagurtomas/nobelings-thm/blob/master/src/connected_characterisation.lean</a> (as you can probably see I'm a Lean beginner).</p>
<p>The "only if" direction is only stated with a two-element target, but this should be easy to generalise to any discrete target. </p>
<p>Any help on how to get my code up to mathlib standards would be appreciated (and I'll also be happy if it's already somewhere in mathlib)!</p>

<p>We have a somewhat extensive API for the space of connected components. It would be great to integrate that result into that part of mathlib! See e.g. <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/connected_components">docs#connected_components</a></p>

<p>I‚Äôm actually surprised that we don‚Äôt have this, because this is one of the most efficient characterizations of connectedness. So it would be a really nice addition, and we could probably golf quite a few proofs using it üòú</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="243562">@Adam Topaz</span> Do you mean that we should state the result as something like "the space of connected components is discrete"?  I would be happy to contribute this mathlib. How does this work in practice?</p>

<p>Imo this characterization (or at least the two elements case) should not depend on connected components, I would really expect it to be one of the first lemmas we prove after the definition. But connected components are defined just a few hundred lines later IIRC so this is not really a big deal if it does depend on it</p>

<p>No we don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve already thought about that, and the conclusion I came to was that if we don‚Äôt have a very good reason to do it, we probably shouldn‚Äôt spend too much time on duplicating all of this API. I‚Äôd say the most efficient way to talk about these currently is as set of the whole type whose preimage by <code>coe</code> is open/closed/clopen.</p>

<p>Note that <code>Prop</code> is the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/sierpinski_space">docs#sierpinski_space</a> by default. If you use <code>bool</code> then you won't have to override the existing <code>topological_space</code> instance on <code>Prop</code>.<br>
Interestingly in category theory we do define connectedness using functors to discrete categories: <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/category_theory.is_preconnected">docs#category_theory.is_preconnected</a>. I'm not sure why it doesn't just use a discrete category with two objects. Quantifying over a universe would better be avoided when possible IMO.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs because the usual notation is bad. What we want is that the identity is continuous from <code>t1</code> to <code>t2</code> iff <code>t1 &lt;= t2</code> (sorry, I‚Äôm on mobile).

<p>When I try to define the characteristic function of a set with values in <code>bool</code>, Lean complains that it doesn't find an instance of  <code>dedcidable x ‚àà U</code>. I can fix the problem by defining it as the composition of the <code>Prop</code>-valued characteristic function and the map <code>Prop ‚Üí bool</code>. However, this requires a <code>noncomputable</code> in  front, whereas everything I did before was computable according to Lean</p>

<p>So you are saying "I'm doing something noncomputable and I'm annoyed that I have to say it's noncomputable"? You can add the hypothesis <code>[decidable_pred (‚àà U)]</code>, or you can write <code>noncomputable theory</code> at the top of your file. Or you can use <code>Prop</code> instead of <code>bool</code>.</p>

<p>The point is that <code>set X</code> is defined to be <code>X ‚Üí Prop</code> and to convert a <code>Prop</code> to <code>bool</code> you need decidability of the proposition. In your <code>mem_setProp</code>, you invoke LEM (law of excluded middle) via <code>by_cases</code>. Without LEM you can't show Prop has exactly two elements and its powerset has four elements.</p>
<p>If you use set.indicator, you won't have to prove the <code>mem_setProp</code> lemma, and can directly use <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/set.indicator_const_preimage">docs#set.indicator_const_preimage</a>. Since we don't want to add a <code>has_zero</code> instance to <code>bool</code>, you may consider declare a has_zero instance within a proof, like <code>letI : has_zero bool := ‚ü®ff‚ü©</code>.</p>

<p>I've completed the proof, with bool as the target and with any discrete target. See here: <a href="https://github.com/dagurtomas/nobelings-thm/blob/master/src/preconnected_characterisation.lean">https://github.com/dagurtomas/nobelings-thm/blob/master/src/preconnected_characterisation.lean</a>. I'm fairly happy with it but comments and suggestions are very welcome. </p>
<p>Should I post this in a different stream to get access to a branch of mathlib where I can submit a PR? My github username is <code>dagurtomas</code></p>

<p>I find this a bit unintuitive BTW that <code>t‚ÇÅ ‚â§ t‚ÇÇ</code> means <code>t‚ÇÇ ‚äÜ t‚ÇÅ</code>; it's contrary to [the usual notation](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_topologies#Definition">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_topologies#Definition</a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, it isn't. The usual notation is never <code>t‚ÇÅ ‚â§ t‚ÇÇ</code>. Where do you see that on this wikipedia page? This page very clearly says that people can't decide what is the order relation and use both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me note that mathlib has the (un-namespaced!) <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/tmp_order">docs#tmp_order</a> on topologies which is the subset order but not an instance. However, it's a local instance for a part of the file, so some lemma like <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/tmp_order">docs#tmp_order</a> gets the subset order instance rather than the default superset order, which can be confusing.</p>
<p>I'd advocate to adopt the subset order everywhere, as I think the reason for not doing so are not good enough, even though I agree with the order on filters. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="268315">@Anatole Dedecker</span> pointed out two monotonicities (like <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/le_of_nhds_le_nhds">docs#le_of_nhds_le_nhds</a>) that would become antitonic for the subset order, but it's not as strong a reason IMO as in the case of filters, where the viewpoint that filters are generalized subsets imposes the superset order.</p>

<p>issues with the fact that <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/tmp_order">docs#tmp_order</a> is un-namespaced aside, I disagree. I think reverse inclusion makes sense for exactly the reason Anatole mentioned before: <code>t‚ÇÅ ‚â§ t‚ÇÇ</code> is the order that makes the identity map from <code>t‚ÇÅ</code> to <code>t‚ÇÇ</code> continuous. So, this is the "covariant" way.</p>

<p>Lemmas that use that temporary order aren't meant to be used outside of a tiny fragment of that file. Where did you see a lemma that you wanted to use?</p>

<p>About the namespace, I guess the correct thing to do is to mark everything about that temporary order relation as private.</p>
