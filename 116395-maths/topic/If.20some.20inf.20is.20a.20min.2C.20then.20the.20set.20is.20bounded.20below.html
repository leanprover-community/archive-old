<p>While playing around with the lattices API ; but I'm not sure how to prove the statement.</p>
<p>I cannot use Inf_ge because it requires bdd_below, so my only option is to say that an Inf which is in the set, is a Min, i.e. is_least S (Inf S) is true.</p>
<p>So I tried to go for this but it requires Inf S to be in lower_bounds, which appears to be true by def?</p>
<p>Even if I'm in a conditional complete lattice, I can always wrap it into a complete lattice by adding bottom and top to extend X.<br>
Using this, I can take Inf of anything, including empty sets, etc. As I have Inf S in S, it fix my problem.</p>
<p>But I'm unsure how to proceed to promote X into a X' with complete_linear_order over it and bring my assumptions over there, finish my proof, come back to the X world.</p>

<p>If the set fails to be bounded below, <code>Inf</code> returns garbage, and that garbage value may happen to lie in the set</p>

<p>That would amount to a predicate formulation, and that already exists without any conditionally complete anything</p>
