<p>(pre)Sheaves on a base have a very similar definitions, proofs, etc. to "regular" sheaves. Maybe I'm getting too greedy, but is there a way we could unify the definitions? Instead of a contravariant functor from <code>opens X</code> to a category, could we replace <code>opens X</code> with an "open-sets-like" category that might work with a topoligical base?</p>
<p>Also this might be nice when we do sites...</p>

<p>In fact, I did it in lean about 1.5 years ago. But that approach to sheaves didn't really work, for reasons that I didn't really understand.</p>

<p>I guess my point was that right now the plain is to separately define sheaves on a topological space, site, topological basis, and not use coverages for now, right?</p>

<p>It's not so clear that there is a plan. When I wanted to define schemes, category theory was not really ready, so I just made sheaves of types on a space, sheaves of types on a basis, sheaves of rings etc all by hand and all differently. It's pretty painless that way, but involves a bunch of repetition. Now of course the general story would be to define sites and then sheaves of X on a site, where X are objects in some category which has enough structure the concept of a sheaf to make sense (e.g. commutative rings, abelian groups...). Now all of a sudden things are going to take a lot longer because Bhavik didn't PR his work because he's a PhD student with a thesis to worry about, and Scott didn't do sheaves in the category theory library yet because he can't figure out a nice API and has 100 other things to worry about, so all of a sudden things start proceeding more slowly. This is the nature of the area. There is no plan. The plan is whatever someone can find the time to do.</p>
