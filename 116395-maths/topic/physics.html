<p>Is someone by any change formalizing (formalized) physics math in Lean?</p>

<p>I don't think so (unless calculus and linear algebra count as physics).</p>

<p>I think at some point, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="201575">@Michael R Douglas</span> was considering formalizing quantum field theories in Lean.</p>

<p>I am interested in it but there are many many prerequisites to do first.<br>
Before working on QM and QFT we need basic functional analysis and especially Fourier analysis.<br>
Another prerequisite of very broad relevance to physics and math is the theory of Lie algebras and Lie groups.<br>
I started working on this with Anthony Bordg, we are doing it in Isabelle to use smooth manifolds as defined by Immler and Zhan.<br>
Even this needs a good amount of additional material to get anywhere.</p>
<p>Here is my suggestion for a project with very very broad relevance: make a general definition of a hypersurface in R^n or C^n.<br>
In other words one is given a function f:R^n\rightarrow R such that f=0 =&gt; grad f \ne 0, and the goal is to define the set of solutions of f(x)=0 as a smooth manifold with its maximal chart.  This would enable us to define a huge list of manifolds including the most important Lie groups and homogeneous spaces in one shot!</p>
