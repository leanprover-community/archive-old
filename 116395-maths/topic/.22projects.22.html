<p>I'm going to delete the "Calculus / analysis" project because it has no particular goal (thus has no chance to be completed) and nobody (including me) cares labeling PRs/issues with this project.</p>

<p>I will get to the number theory project over the summer when I am running undergraduate projects. I regard these projects as somewhat of an experiment right now.</p>

<p>I think that it makes sense to have projects with specific goals (e.g., "sphere eversion" or "FTC") while "Calculus / analysis" makes sense as a label, not as a project.</p>
