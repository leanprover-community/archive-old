<p>I knocked off a basic theory of nilpotent groups yesterday because I was talking about possible projects with an undergraduate and this was one (I thought I'd start them off). But the linter informs me that my predicate <code>is_nilpotent</code> on groups in the root namespace clashes with the predicate <code>is_nilpotent</code> on elements of rings (or more generally monoids with zero) also in the root namespace. Such is life -- but what do I do? Define <code>group.is_nilpotent</code>? The word nilpotent certainly means several (related, but not equal) things in mathematics.</p>

<p>Sorry, I put <code>is_nilpotent</code> into the global namespace! For what it's worth, I face the Lie algebra variant of your group problem and I just rely on namespacing <code>lie_algebra.is_nilpotent</code>.</p>

<p>OK I'll put this stuff in the <code>group</code> namespace. Thanks!</p>

<p>I am not sure if this is a good idea, but could <code>is_nilpotent</code> be the <code>to_additive</code> version of <code>is_unipotent</code>?  In my mental picture, this captures most of the meaning of "unipotent/nilpotent", at least when applied to individual elements.</p>
<p>This would also go well with a unipotent/nilpotent matrices.</p>

<p>I think you're talking about nilpotent elements not nilpotent groups, and I think what you're suggesting will run into the issue that r^n=1 will be translated by to_additive as n \bub r = 0 rather than r^n=0 :-)</p>

<p>Yes, I was indeed thinking about individual elements.  Also, you are right about the <code>pow/smul</code> issue.  I know that Floris has been updating <code>to_additive</code>, but I do not know if he tried to make this work as well...</p>

<p>I believe that he got it working fine!</p>
<p>I guess I mis-spoke -- I don't think r^n=1 is relevant here. What does unipotent mean to you? Do you just mean (r-1)^n=0? I am not sure that <code>to_additive</code> should be translating between nilpotent and unipotent elements, I think the relationship is more subtle. <code>to_additive</code> is performing the blanket isomorphism between group theory set up <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>×</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\times</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.66666em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;"></span><span class="mord">×</span></span></span></span> and group theory set up with <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>+</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">+</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.66666em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;"></span><span class="mord">+</span></span></span></span>. The relationship between unipotent and nilpotent seems to me to be something to do with the much more subtle relationship between them, namely via <code>exp</code> and <code>log</code>, where these things are often not isomorphisms, but rather local isomorphisms where the interest is in higher-order effects (e.g. the Lie bracket comes from failure of commutativity of multiplication, pushed into an additive world via exp rather than by to_additive, and my feeling about the relationship between unipotent and nilpotent elements is that it's of a similar flavour.)</p>

<p>I think that you are right, Kevin: in my mind, I was thinking of <code>to_additive</code> as a magic wand that would convert <em>anything</em> multiplicative to <em>anything</em> additive, e.g. using <code>exp/log</code> when needed.</p>
<p>My wishful thinking came about precisely because you mentioned nilpotency in the context of groups and right after, it was pointed out that there is nilpotency for Lie algebras.  Thus, I got to thinking: could the conversion between Lie groups and Lie algebras be automated (at least somewhat)?  And my mind very happily said "there already is <code>to_additive</code>"!</p>
<p>I guess that there is the need for a <code>to_lie_algebra</code> tactic...</p>
