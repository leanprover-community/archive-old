<p>I believe univalence can consistently be added to lean, since classical logic is valid in the simplicial set model<br>
(<a href="https://www.math.uwo.ca/faculty/kapulkin/notes/LEM_in_sSet.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://www.math.uwo.ca/faculty/kapulkin/notes/LEM_in_sSet.pdf">https://www.math.uwo.ca/faculty/kapulkin/notes/LEM_in_sSet.pdf</a>).<br>
Moreover, that model also interprets strict propositions.<br>
One would of course need to disable UIP for universes. Would that be possible?</p>

<p>and also it means that it would be much harder to make it all again, because the cool tricks we can get away with because any two terms of type P : Prop are equal won't work any more, so it might not even be possible to make parts of mathlib again if we have univalence.</p>

<p>This theorising is all well and good but you seem to be saying "if lean's core logic is changed a bit then it would be interesting to see what still works" and I'm merely pointing out that it might be much much harder to develop a proper maths library, which is my impression of what happens the moment you go univalent: you can compute homotopy types of synthetic spheres and then the only thing you can do is higher topos theory</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> Most of basic maths happens at the lowest type level, so things wouldn't change much. Only the first universe becomes a groupoid, the second a 2-groupoid, etc.<br>
One would notice it when formalizing presheaves, and there I would expect it to be the more natural thing to do. Unless one is "evil":<br>

<p>Presheaves are just a fancy word for functors and I'm sure there will be no problems with functors in a HoTT theory. I want to go much further than this. I want to see the proof that the presheaf of rings on an affine scheme is a sheaf, ie not just a definition of presheaves but a proof that they can be used. This took a team of complete amateurs a few months in Lean -- we were all mathematicians who knew nothing about computer proof systems or type theory one year earlier. I genuinely don't know whether the reason this isn't done in any computer HoTT system is because the systems aren't capable or because there just isn't anyone interested in doing it. I believe that there are classical hypotheses everywhere in the argument.</p>

<p>The reason I am banging on about this is that if your original assertion is supposed to imply that adding univalence does not in theory break anything, then I am pointing at an explicit piece of MSc level mathematics whose proof will be completely broken by it and am trying to ask the question "is there any evidence that it can actually be fixed in practice?". I am arguing that it took a team of amateurs a few months to make this proof in Lean in their spare time, so it does not seem like an unreasonable practical challenge. In my mind, one of the main things lean has going for it is a whole bunch of examples of mathematics at MSc level and above being done with relative ease by the community -- a proof that the proof assistant is usable in practice to do "fashionable mathematics".</p>
<p>However this might well be a long way from the point you were trying to make originally and so I'll now stop banging on about this on this thread. Sorry to derail. </p>
<p>I think Chris' original comment on Gabriel's work on HoTT in Lean 3 is the place to start. Both he and Floris van Doorn are experts in doing HoTT in Lean, but currently I don't think either of them are doing any, and perhaps this is only because the community is not there yet.</p>

<p>I could envisage someone setting an undergraduate project on doing some HoTT formalisation in Lean using Gabriel's library and then a stream being set up here for HoTT In Lean and one could just see how easy it is to do mathematics in practice in this mode. It would definitely be an interesting and worthwhile project. One could imagine the UniMath library and the HoTT book as being useful resources and one could ask whether this Lean framework is easier to use than the corresponding Coq framework</p>

<p>Thanks for reminding me of this library! I see that it is actively growing too :D People are currently thinking about groups, judging by recent commits. Can you state Sylow's theorems? Can you prove them?</p>
<p>To give you some sort of data point for comparison, when I arrived at Lean they had in their maths library a theory of groups, rings and topological spaces, and a good theory of finite sets. They had the naturals, integers, rationals and reals, and perhaps not too much more of interest to a "working mathematician" (although my memory might be inaccurate). This was definitely enough to get me interested though. Within a year Chris Hughes had proved Sylow's theorems, and he was a 1st year undergraduate mathematician with training in computer proof systems; Kenny Lau had set up a theory of localisation of rings, and he was also a 1st year undergraduate mathematician with no prior training in computer proof systems, and the three of us had proved this result about schemes. The reason I'm mentioning it is that one could ask what the "bare minimum"is that one needs to get mathematicians involved. And in my experience it's undergraduate mathematicians you can start with, especially when you say to them "hey there's this cool system and there's a whole bunch of undergraduate level maths in it which you can do and which we need". </p>
<p>Are you considering the possibility of porting this library to Lean? Is that the question you're really asking -- whether the logics of the systems are sufficiently compatible?</p>

<p>Impredicativity isn't compatible with HoTT right? This is something that seems quite important to do normal maths.</p>

<p>Actually, impredicativity can be done in HoTT but it doesn't look the same. There is a well known result that says that two impredicative universes is inconsistent, and one impredicative universe is System F which does not have the "standard semantics" we like to have for function types and such. In the standard HoTT foundations you can define what it means for a type to be a proposition, but you end up with a subset of the universe at each level that are propositions, and there may be "more propositions" at the higher levels; this is what we mean by predicativity.</p>
<p>In order to reflect these propositions down to the lowest level to get something more impredicative, there is Voevodsky's "universe resizing" rule. IIRC it says that if <code>A : Type u</code> and <code>is_prop A</code> (which we would render as <code>subsingleton A</code>), then there exists <code>A' : Type 0</code> such that <code>equiv A A'</code> (and a forteriori <code>is_prop A'</code> as well).</p>

<p>but the upshot of all this is still not clear to me. It sounds like you are offering most of the features lean has already. What are we giving up? Clearly something has to give since univalence in lean is disprovable</p>

<p>the stuff about simplicial sets or cubical set models is not relevant for the lean user, since we are working <em>in</em> the theory not <em>on</em> the theory. (Formalizing type theories would be a worthy project but quite independent of tweaks to lean foundations.)</p>

<p>One would have a type theory with two kinds of propositions, strict ones and hProps.<br>
set level mathematics should go through at the bottom universe, but the other universes can be univalent.<br>
So one would need to give up UIP for the higher universes.</p>

<p>Wait, so the lowest universe is not univalent in this scheme? Isn't that where all the interesting maths would go? For example, I guess one desideratum would be to have <code>real = real x {0}</code> be provable, as well as similar statements for the corresponding elements of a fully bundled type <code>Ring := Sigma (A : Type 0) (mul : A -&gt; A -&gt; A), ...</code>. As I understand it this is the main selling point of having univalence around, but these objects are h-sets, possibly strict sets if you prefer, and live in the bottom universe. (<code>Ring</code> lives in the next universe but equality of rings, which should mean ring isomorphism, depends on equality in <code>Type 0</code>, and so needs the bottom universe to be univalent.)</p>

<p>While UIP is tremendously convenient, it doesn't actually enable any particular kind of maths, as long as you can obtain the (non-judgmental) equality by other means. It would still require a lot of engineering effort to recover the same level of ease of use that you get with UIP, but at least in principle I can see giving it up provided that things like the resizing axiom are around to allow us to do long well founded recursions and such.</p>

<p>I think it would be very helpful if some HoTT library would demonstrate that it's useful for maths that doesn't look like homotopy theory. It doesn't have to be perfectoid spaces. But something like the Hilbert basis theorem, or even better fundamental theorem of calculus. Those are low-level from a maths point of view, but my impression is that they are currently challenging for HoTT libs.</p>

<p>This is not what is taught in 1st year undergraduate classes. What Johan and I are trying to say is this: if HoTT is supposed to be able to do mathematics, let's see some mathematics which are taught in standard undergraduate mathematics classes. Where is quadratic reciprocity in any HoTT theory? The proof of this is not straightforward. You need a robust theory of finite sets. You need to be able to count. Where is the proof of Lagrange's theorem? Where is "normal mathematics"? machine integers and universal algebra etc are exactly what we are <em>not</em> talking about.</p>

<p>I have the following analogy. It is consistent with ZF to assume that every set of the real line is measurable. Then, one can add this axiom, and do all measure theory in an extremely nice way (much nicer than what is usually done because you won't need to check measurability any time). Except that then you can not integrate this measure theory library with other traditional parts of maths that require choice (for instance the existence of the algebraic closure), as assuming measurability of everything is contradictory with choice. In this situation, it seems to me that doing measure theory in this way would be cheating, and mostly useless to build a whole library of mathematics.</p>
<p>As to whether this is a good analogy with HOTT, I won't say anything, because I don't understand anything to HOTT.</p>

<p>The number of axioms is not the only factor. We lose definitional proof irrelevance. Will automation apply it for us instead? How often will I need to prove that my type is an hSet? Or is that automated? Is there type class inference? Is there a simplifier? Do they work?</p>

<p>for that argument to work, you have to be able to mimic/model/implement every single one of lean's axioms and defeqs. The "coq is a lean typechecker" suggests that this is very nearly possible, but it seems like you still have to give up some things, like lean's strong form of the axiom of choice</p>

<p>By the way, lean's version of the axiom of choice isn't even ok in ZFC. It's known as "global choice", positing the existence of a proper class function that is a choice function on every set</p>

<p>I'm not sure this is true though since a Lean term can only talk about finitely many choice constants.  Lean has a <code>choice.{u}</code> constant for every universe <code>u</code>.  There is no relation between <code>choice.{u}</code> and <code>choice.{u+1}</code> (except for what you get out of the type).  And each <code>choice.{u}</code> is definable in ZFC + enough inaccessibles.</p>

<p>I guess it's not really that different from the choice constants though. At some point this sequence breaks down - it's well defined but no longer points at anything because you've run out of inaccessibles in the outer model, say - and you can do something similar with the choice sequence where you start with an assumption that gives you the first 42 choice constants and the rest of them are just nonsense</p>

<p>I guess  is related to the fact that the first released version of Coq is more than 30 years old. Nit-picking:  other  parts of a proof assistant, for which a paper description is seldom available, have at least as much impact on users and on their act of faith in formal statements. E.g. the elaborator, the parser etc. Since I am more interested in maths than in immediate applications in, e.g., security, I am not too worried though :).</p>

<p>I am willing to believe that every piece of Coq foundations has been described in some paper written over the past 30 years. But there are also probably some bits of black magic in the ML code that never got air-time in a paper, and also the lack of central description means a lack of (proof of) global coherence, which is of course critical for soundness</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="259452">@Bas Spitters</span> The parametricity plugin written by Cyril will prove the parametricity theorem for "any lean term". It works by recursion over the term syntax of the language, but it can get stuck when it gets to certain things. For axioms, there is nowhere to recurse so you have to manually provide a proof of parametricity. And <code>choice</code> simply doesn't satisfy the parametricity theorem, so any terms built using <code>choice</code> (and there are a lot of them) are similarly blocked. There are also complications in some inductive types, but last I saw there were no real theoretical barriers.</p>

<p>Right, somehow the pure "abstract nonsense" proof of parametricity doesn't work in practice because <code>choice</code> is too deeply ingrained. But for more engineering minded folks like myself the news isn't all bad. Although we use <code>choice</code> a lot to do proofs, it's not like we have choicy functions all over the place. Mathematicians by and large tend to avoid constructions that are not "canonical" in some sense and this means that "random functions" are quite rare. So one might hope to blockade the region around <code>choice</code> by proving, by alternate means, the parametricity theorem for certain terms that use <code>choice</code> in their definition, and then being able to stop the recursion when you get there rather than peeking into the definition and getting stuck on <code>choice</code>.</p>
<p>In particular, much of our usage of <code>choice</code> comes via <code>classical.em</code>, which I think satisfies the parametricity theorem because of proof irrelevance</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> I am not sure what you refer to, but <em>anti-classical</em> has a well-defined meaning and this doesn't apply to Coq. Coq is compatible with classical logic, but it doesn't imply it. So, parametricity breaks in presence of classical logic, but that's not preventing the extension of Coq with classical principles. Furthermore, adding effects to a language just weakens parametricity, there are still weaker presentations that can be salvaged.</p>

<p>As long as the union of all provided axioms is still consistent, it's not so bad to work with subsets. You can choose not to use any of them, or just one, or just a different one, and all the libraries are compatible. As soon as you throw in an axiom that is inconsistent with the others, you bifurcate the libraries and the community</p>

<p>This may look like an alien statement to the mathematicians around here, but I do think this kind of belief of "the one metatheory to rule them all" is 19th century thinking. If you accept proof-as-programs, then it makes sense to have several programming languages enforcing contradictory invariants. And this has nothing to do with the old feud between intuitionistic crackpots and the rest of the mathematical community, this is just about accepting the world as it is.</p>

<p>The reason "Coq is a Lean typechecker" and not the other way around is because Coq is stronger. Strength is not a strength</p>

<p>Lean has a marker, called <code>noncomputable</code>, that you are required to put on any definition that cannot be executed. There is a way to put this at the start of your file to say "I don't care about computability", and most mathematicians do this for their theories of category theory, commutative algebra and whatnot. If you care about computability, you write computable defs, which don't have this marking, and lean will generate bytecode on the spot. These functions can be called via <code>#eval</code> with concrete arguments and you get values out just like any programming language.</p>

<p>Moreover, there are ways to compute even with noncomputable terms, using tactics, and this is in fact the preferred method (by comparison to proofs by reflection). This is exemplified in tactics like <code>norm_num</code> that will prove things like <code>100 + 100 = 200</code> by cobbling proofs together, even though yes, you could prove it by <code>rfl</code>, the proof takes too long</p>

<p>Note also that if you provide a proof term you have a lot of flexibility in how to do the computation. For example when <code>norm_num</code> proves or disproves primality, the first thing it does is find out if the number is actually prime, and if not, it has a very short proof of the negation. A reduction based proof would have to do the whole primality thing even in the composite case</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="259452">@Bas Spitters</span> In a literal sense, of course they are not; lean provides one choice axiom and they are using it. But more likely you mean that they would be equally happy with a Lawvere style axiom of choice, and I'm not sure this is true. Among other things, we use <code>choice</code> to do definite descriptions. So things like <code>sum (f : nat -&gt; real) : real</code> will be defined using <code>choice</code>. (It would also be used here to do an outer if statement: if the sum is not defined then return 0 else return the unique sum of the sequence.)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> I am not an expert on this topic, but the people in constructive/computer algebra have considered this topic. E.g.<br>

What is interesting is that the same abstractions are useful in topos theory (Coste, Roy, Lombardi, Wraith, ...) and in computer algebra (magma,GAP, ...)<br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110172">@Assia Mahboubi</span> may know more. <br>
I would imagine that a more algebraic development is more suitable for formalization. However, it is possible that we do not have all the right abstractions yet.</p>

<p>Then some definitions like (hypothetically, I don't think this is the actual mathlib definition) the dimension of a vector space as "pick a basis, and take its cardinality" can be formulated in terms of <code>unique_choice</code>, but it requires proving that the result is independent of the choice. Which is also the rule in ordinary math.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as "true mathematics" so it doesn't make sense to ask our users to abide to a specific set of axioms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="260981">@Pierre-Marie Pédrot</span> in my department the vast majority of us think ZFC is true mathematics, and I am certain that many other mathematics departments think the same way. The fact that logicians and computer scientists have invented a whole bunch more options and then decide to call them mathematics is problematic, because it means that discussions can degenerate into axiomatic issues which <em>as far as a mathematician is concerned</em> are completely solved. The axiom of choice is an axiom of maths as practiced in mathematics departments. Johan is absolutely right when he says that mathematicians are not interested in this stuff. You say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... or maybe we can teach the mathematicians about computer science to make them understand it's not a sterile debate?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but it is much <em>worse</em> than that -- it is not a sterile debate -- we finished debating 100 years ago and decided what mathematics was, and the fact that you guys are still arguing over it is of no interest to us. From your point of view this debate is very important, because if you want to design a new computer proof system than of course foundations are absolutely a major issue. But from a mathematician's point of view, ZFC works, constructivism doesn't work, ZF doesn't work, and these topics are not being studied in mathematics departments other than by a small niche group of people. We mathematicians are looking for a system where we can <em>reason the way we reason on paper</em> and having tried several systems I currently believe that Lean 3 is the closest we have to this; I can name explicit problems with every other system, either of the form "not enough foundations yet" or "can't do some part of modern mathematics in a way which is practical". For Coq it is "quotients", which are absolutely everywhere in modern mathematics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once again, I think we should turn to programming engineering to draw inspiration. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We mathematicians cannot turn to programming languages to draw inspiration because for you guys it's really important to have lots of different programming languages, because different languages are good at different things. We are attempting to make one coherent body of mathematics, and it's really important that everything is compatible with everything else. In particular every paper in number theory has to be accessible to me if I am a number theorist so it's really important that they all have the same foundations, and these foundations are decided -- they are ZFC -- and sure, add universes if you like, it doesn't matter, because it turns out that the kind of mathematics we do can sometimes be made easier with universes but we actually know tricks to get it back into ZFC. But we will not settle for anything less. LEM and AC are <em>embedded</em>. We are not going back.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And FTR I don't really care about the sympathy of mathematicians. I have enough "real math" friends of mine who make fun of type theory and computer assistants. It's a social issue, not a technical one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I am trying to do in Lean is to bring mathematicians in and get them using this software. In particular I need to <em>hide</em> type theory if I want to get them to use computer assistants. It is a social issue and it is one which I think is extremely important, but we as proof assistant users need to tread carefully when attracting mathematicians into the area. I simply tell mathematicians that a type is a set where the elements aren't necessarily sets any more but could just be "atoms", and suggest that actually this is the way they think about stuff they call sets. </p>
<p>I want to meet computer scientists "half way" and so I can have some dialogue with them about the future of these sytems -- but there are some ground rules, and AC and LEM and noncomputability are part of them. Any suggestion that a system which doesn't have them can be used to do modern mathematics is ridiculous to our ears, so the conversation cannot even start. This is why I use Lean and this is why I tell other mathematicians to use Lean.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This is great, because that's what some people in the community are trying to provide in type theory in a way that <em>actually works</em>. Disclaimer: I am one of those, and I am not advocating against EM + AC. I am just constantly disappointed by the lack of consideration from mathematicians on the topic of foundations. And I am not saying that anybody should turn into a type theorist, but at least that they should be <em>listened</em> to, which is very different.</p>
<p>So far, the logical choices of Lean are the dependent type theory equivalent of PHP. Yes, it <em>kind of works</em>, until you reach the size of Facebook and realize that you wrote your stuff on quicksand, and that disregard for foundational issues have a long term cost you'll only realize at that point. And now, they're switching parts of their code to ReasonML because the trade-off is long overdue.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I am not complaining about that. It is better to use whatever proof assistant than nothing, and the state of a few areas of mathematics is depressing. Needing a Fields medal to dismiss a broken proof is not a great situation, if you ask me.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>There is wide evidence that no mathematician ever uses ZFC anyways, so I don't think it's very hard to make them forget about sets, except maybe for some weird hilbertian fetichism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For Coq it is "quotients", which are absolutely everywhere in modern mathematics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will call your bluff, because you keep spreading this lie around, and I am starting to be slightly annoyed. As demonstrated by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="243878">@Gaëtan Gilbert</span> , it is perfectly possible to get quotients in Coq with the very same rules, if you opt-in for a broken feature that is hardwired in Lean. Even Santa Claus choice can be obtained by similar tricks. I have actually heard rumours that you didn't even try Coq thoroughly, and I even believe there is a written account of that. You don't have indeed to try everything out there to settle for a tool, and it's nice to see math users playing around with any type-theoretic proof assistant.</p>
<p>Yet, I am a type theorist and I would never not making random claims in some arbitrary area of mathematics.</p>
<p>But once again, I claim the minimal divergence of foundations between Lean and Coq are of little relevance to formalization of mathematics. From what I gather, Lean has not reached Gonthier's famous <em>wall of complexity</em>. By that, he means that a lot of a priori ridiculous technical impediments are paving the way to mathematical formalization. I am genuinely willing to see an actual large mathematical development in Lean, to satisfy my own computer scientist fetichism, namely <em>scalability</em>. It might be changing, but Coq proofs are still a cottage industry. Can Lean do better?</p>

<p>I don't think the question is whether they can be constructed in Coq. To an outsider to type theory like me, the systems are sufficiently similar that I have little doubt that something natural that can be made with one can be made with the other. The question is rather whether they are used in the libraries, i.e., if the main libraries with the software try to use a constructivist point of view, or don't care and go full classical right away. Here I can see a really different approach currently with the Coq and Lean communities. I think it is very healthy that different viewpoints are tried and put forward, but mathematicians will be more easily attracted to libraries that use choice and LEM from the very beginning, because it will sound more familiar to them.</p>

<p>You are right about my Coq experience. I heard about this "setoid hell" from various people but I am certainly not an experienced Coq user. I will try and get some more concrete facts.</p>
<p>Mathematicians are <em>terrible</em> about foundations. It is not regarded as an interesting topic by most people, because "all the interesting questions were solved when forcing was invented" or something :-/ You are also right that we don't use ZFC in practice, however it is true that there is a general belief that whatever it is that we <em>are</em> doing, it is possible to translate it down to ZFC (and classical logic) in theory. My impression is that in the areas I am interested in (number theory, arithmetic geometry) it is possible to find people (they are rare, but they exist) who actually know how to do this, but it is not something which is deemed particularly important. Somehow the workers in each area know the API, and then a few people know how to get from the API to the foundations, but what is taught is the API.</p>
<p>I am not necessarily saying that Lean is the solution to everything. But I think it is close enough to being able to simulate the kind of mathematics done by mathematicians that it might be enough to get people interested in the theory in general. My general line of thought is this. Which system is best for modern mathematics? We don't really know. So let's try and get mathematicians actually making mathematics in as many systems as possible, because my impression is that when we get stuck the computer scientists are able to understand what the problem is and try to solve it. You know we have some typeclass problems in Lean 3, which I think were basically discovered because of mathematicians trying to push the system? Hopefully these will be fixed in Lean 4.</p>
<p>I guess it will take time before we have a large development. I guess we are working on mathlib as being this development?</p>

<p>I don't know why Coq has this aura of knife-between-their-teeth intuitionists in the mathematical community. Just as mathematicians, most computer scientists don't care at all about their foundations. Most serious computer science Coq developments I know of actually use classical axioms everywhere.</p>

<p>I remember one of the first things I noticed when reading the Coq odd order paper was that they said that the result was proved constructively, and I thought "what does that even _mean_?" (this was a few years ago before I knew the definition). And then later on they started explaining about how they couldn't use the complex numbers and I was totally speechless. I think it is more the issue that constructivism is simply not taught in mathematics departments, so we find anyone who talks about it slightly scary.</p>

<p>It's strange, because I am fairly sure mathcomp uses classical logic locally. Dually to Lean, they mark classical statements by quantifying over a proof of EM. Anyway, AFAIR it does not even matter for the odd order theorem since it's a negative statement, which are essentially equivalent in intuitionistic and classical logic.</p>

<p>I think this is the main reason I am so edgy about the univalence axiom. It starts with a discussion of univalence, and within minutes the conversation has either turned to elementary topoi (about which mathematicians know nothing), or constructivism (about which mathematicians know nothing), or some discussion about how things can be equal in more than one way (which just sounds like complete craziness). It is so far from what happens in practice in maths departments.</p>

<p>Absolutely. Because it means, at some point, you will have to make some effort to stay constructive (otherwise, you wouldn't put the word constructive in the file name). So, the definition starts with some constructive stuff, and then goes classical. To me, if you can express a statement or a proof by remaining constructive but it requires 1% effort more, then it should be avoided (both for the library builder, and for the user who will have to skim the library), simply because there's no point. Maybe I am a little extreme there, but I think it is pretty reasonable in fact.</p>

<p>I use a lot of functional analysis (in the sense of operator theory on spaces of functions, so with concrete applications to other problems in mind), but not on the abstract side of things (I know what a trace on a C^* algebra is, but I don't use them in my research). So, I am away from the finite world (where decidable methods are appealing because they can let you compute for free on examples), and away from the more abstract sides (higher homotopy theory for instance) where foundational discussions become relevant. So yes, I am definitely biased away from these questions. But I guess that this is also the case of maybe 90% working mathematicians.</p>

<p>For most of basic analysis such proofs would be naturally constructive, and one would combine the proof of convergence with the estimate on the remainder.<br>
You are right, it is not needed to do so.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110044">@Chris Hughes</span>  With a bit of engineering this can be made practical. However, with epsilon-delta proofs one is computing backwards from the precision of the result to the precision of the input.<br>
For optimal speed, one wants to compute forwards: start with a small interval see whether the result is precise enough. If not, start over with double precision. This is what IRRAM does:<br>
