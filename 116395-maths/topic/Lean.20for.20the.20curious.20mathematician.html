<p>I am organising a Lean workshop in Freiburg (Germany), 13â€“17 July 2020.<br>
Some of you may have heard of the plans already during the Lean Together meeting in Pittsburgh. I've finally got the organisational hiccups worked out. So, if you are a mathematician, or you know a mathematician who is really interested in learning more about Lean, please let them know about this meeting: <a href="https://math.commelin.net/2020/lftcm/" target="_blank" title="https://math.commelin.net/2020/lftcm/">https://math.commelin.net/2020/lftcm/</a></p>
<p>The plan is to have a couple of talks and tutorial sessions, but to also have ~50% of the time dedicated to hackathons and brainstorming sessions, or pair programming. Novices could team up with experts, to see how they go about setting up a theory, etc...</p>
<p>There is limited funding for PhD students and postdocs. Please let me know if you need this.<br>
In general, if you have any questions, please ask.</p>

<p>But since the plan was just a couple of talks and mostly hackathon, it might not be very different from what we are doing here on Zulip. And the "newbie sits next to expert to gets started" part of the program will go down the drain anyway.</p>

<p>Over the last few days I've thought a bit about this. It's clear that there is sufficient interest in doing something. I see two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We turn this into a online workshop.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have several live-streaming sessions via Twitch, where people can see "experts" working with Lean, and demoing how Lean/mathlib works.</li>
<li>We can use Discord and/or Zulip to answer questions from newcomers</li>
<li>We can advertise this in several places.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If we choose this option, then I cannot organise this alone. I currently do not have enough time to be the only organiser, and also during the week itself, I will need to be offline several moments to supervise my kids with homeschooling etc.<br>
I really like this option, but I would need 2 or 3 coorganisers that have ample experience with lean and/or organising workshops.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>I postpone this till a later date, when I have enough time and energy to organise this. Maybe we can then even meet physically.</li>
</ol>

<p>I just did a twitch stream. Notes for others who want to do this for the first time:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>I used "StreamLabs OBS" which is free and has windows and Mac versions, idk how easy it is to install on linux.</li>
<li>It took me about 30 minutes of fiddling with StreamLabs settings before I was ready to go live. There are many tutorial videos on youtube.</li>
<li>It helps to have a second monitor to do the programming on, so you can use your first monitor to watch twitch chat and deal with admin-y things</li>
<li>If you want Twitch to save a recording of the stream, you have to check a box in your settings before you start</li>

<p>OBS Studio can be fine-tuned depending on your hardware/connection, like if you want to decrease latency (zerolatency mode), or if you want to optimize quality, etc. Some streaming providers also have an option for latency, YT has a super zero latency mode, where it tries to get you as close as you can, during my tests, I could run ~ 30-45 mn stream with ~3-5 seconds of latency with a 1 Gbps/600 Mbps (and 1-5 ms latency) connection over Ethernet.</p>

<p>On Linux, depending on your window manager, on your exact setup, some apps don't pick up the right windows, OBS Studio is rather here to consolidate everything you want for, you can throw dynamic stuff too using the JavaScript feature (for showing chat on the screen or whatever), it really depends in the end of how it's going to look like</p>

<p>There's some talk about this <a href="#narrow/stream/238830-Lean-for.20the.20curious.20mathematician.202020/topic/schedule/near/200641571">here</a>. I think the plan is to have a Europe-centric notion of "morning" and "afternoon" sessions. People in the americas could come to the afternoon sessions without much trouble. People in east easia could come to the morning sessions without much trouble. We should strive to have recordings of lectures available immediately after the session, for the benefit of people in non-european timezones. Twitch does this automatically for kevin's content there.</p>
