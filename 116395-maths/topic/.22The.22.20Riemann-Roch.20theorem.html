<p>I was looking around for mathematical results which were both important and beautiful, and Riemann--Roch theorems came up. The Atiyah--Singer index theorem is what people call a generalization of the Riemann--Roch theorem, and the Grothendieck--Rieman--Roch theorem is another theorem with this property, but actually these are generalizations of two distinct theorems: one about holomorphic sections of complex line bundles on compact Riemann surfaces, and one about algebraic sections of algebraic line bundles on smooth proper algebraic curves over an arbitrary base field. Neither Riemann nor Roch would have considered the case of curves over e.g. a finite field; it might be the case that the algebro-geometric proof is due to Weil (who didn't have schemes but didn't need them for this) and was historically much later.</p>
<p>So one could ask where we are with these Riemann--Roch theorems, and indeed we could even have a Riemann--Roch race, where algebraic geometers and differential geometers build up enough theory to state and then prove the two theorems. Even stating them is hard work. In fact there are even questions involved in how one states them.  </p>
<h2>The curves</h2>
<p>One reason I suspect we're nowhere near RR in algebraic geometry is because AFAIK we still haven't defined curves yet. And even if one did (just asking that local rings are one-dimensional) we'd still have to either say that they were projective or proper, and at present we can do neither. My impression is that in differential geometry we can talk about compact Riemann surfaces, and Heather's recent proof that holomorphic functions are all constant was one of the things which got me thinking about this.</p>
<h2>The bundles</h2>
<p>Is RR a statement about line bundles or about divisors? Let's stick to divisors for the moment, because they're easier to define (in both categories). After Heather's result one could then perhaps prove by induction that h^0(D) is finite-dimensional for all divisors D in the analytic category. But then you have to define K, which would involve coming up with a nonzero meromorphic 1-form on an arbitrary compact Riemann surface. Is this feasible? Alternatively one could ask for a statement about line bundles. In algebraic geometry my understanding is that we have not yet figured out how to define sheaves of modules. Are people thinking about this? There was a thread a while ago basically suggesting two definitions and pointing problems with both of them. This is a problem that we will have to solve. But having solved it, probably globalizing Kaehler 1-forms will be straightforward because they're so functorial. In differential geometry I think we have the tangent bundle for a compact Riemann surface and now one would need to take the dual of this and then tensor it with the dual of the line bundle -- my memory was that linear algebra on bundles was once problematic (a long time ago), but perhaps this issue has been solved now. </p>
<h2>The statement</h2>
<p>If you use line bundles then you'll have to define the degree, in both the algebraic and analytic category; this would probably involve constructing the explicit dictionary between line bundles and divisors modulo principal divisors, which is true in both categories and which is true much more generally at least in the algebraic world (you certainly don't need the base to be a smooth curve, although it helps if it's smooth in codimension 1; presumably there's a similar story in the analytic world). If you work with divisors this would be easy. Proving that global sections are finite-dimensional would be an interesting story as well. Finally, there's the genus. There are three ways to define this; h^0(Omega), h^1(structure sheaf), and (a definition which only works in the analytic case) the topological definition via singular cohomology of the Riemann surface. </p>
<h2>The motivation</h2>
<p>It seemed to me that even formalising the two <em>statements</em> would very naturally drive library development in important areas of mathematics.</p>

<p>For the Atiyah-Singer index theorem I think we are extremely far away from stating the theorem (even though it just "analytical index is equal to topological index"). I don't know the details that go into defining the topological index, but you need at least some semi-serious theory of characteristic classes and cohomology of vector bundles.<br>
I think the problems are more serious with the analytic index (I might be wrong here, because I know more about that part therefore see more issues). First you need to define all the abstract stuff about Fredholm operators, then you need some theory about differential operators on manifolds. Then you remember that differential operators are not bounded on <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>L</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L^2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8141em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal">L</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8141em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> and you need to define Sobolev spaces and show that differential operators map Sobolev space as expected. Finally you need to show that elliptic differential operators have parametrices to obtain that they are Fredholm and the most common way (I am highly biased here) is to invent pseudodifferential operators and prove 2 volumes of Hörmander's monographs worth of theorems about pseudos (probably very fun, but an insane amount of work). Before you can define the index you still have show that the Fredholm index does not depend on which <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">s</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">s</span></span></span></span> you choose for your Sobolev space - this is like a light-hearted epilogue in a movie.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure you don't need a full theory of pseudodifferential operators to show that elliptic operators on a manifold have Fredholm resolvents, it should follow from some basic smoothing properties of elliptic operators (agreed, even defining elliptic operators in terms of principal symbol requires some pseudodiff language...)</p>

<p>Sebastien, you could get around it with using the old 'freezing the coefficients' trick and even if you use pseudos, then you 'only' need boundedness of 0th order pseudos, composition, and the elliptic parametrix. so no subprincipal symbol, wavefront sets, sharp Gårding, etc. I guess you could get around not using asymptotic summation. My point was just that these things are really involved and there are only a few people contributing to the analysis part of mathlib, so that even defining the analytical index is in a very far future</p>

<p>Here's a start on the graph version: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/graph_riemann_roch">branch#graph_riemann_roch</a>. I took the freedom to lift more operations to the Picard group than necessary. In particular, I give it a partial order (<code>a ≤ b ↔ ∃ a' b', ⟦a'⟧ = a ∧ ⟦b'⟧ = b ∧ a' ≤ b'</code>) that makes it into an ordered group. This allows me to not define at all effective divisors (as now <code>effective a ↔ 0 ≤ a</code>) and to define the rank of a divisor very succinctly:</p>

<p>Could you rename your project to make it clear this isn't "the" Riemann-Roch?</p>

<p>Yes, Riemann-Roch is very well understood by everyone to mean "the" Riemann-Roch theorem, a theorem which algebraic geometers claim says something and differential geometers claim says something different, but everyone knows that this is what it says, not the graph thing</p>

<p>Please rename! I don't know what it should be.</p>

<p>"Riemann-Roch for graphs" will be well-understood</p>

<p>Ah but I meant this project to gather the progress of the three possible Riemann-Roch.</p>

<p>It doesn't make much sense to track progress on the actual Riemann-Roch theorems, we are too far away.</p>

<p>Yes we seem to be still very far from being able to state either of them</p>
