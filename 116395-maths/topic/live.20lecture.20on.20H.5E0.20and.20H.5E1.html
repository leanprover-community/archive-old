<p>So in 1 hour I'll be live on the discord with a bunch of PhD students trying to figure out how to prove some basic theorems in group cohomology, just H^0 and H^1 (defined explicitly as cocycles over coboundaries). It has been a joy to code up this stuff, there is a very principled way of doing it involving coercions to functions which makes everything very clean. I even put a README up <a href="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/formalising-mathematics/tree/master/src/week_8">here</a> explaining a bit more about what's going on.</p>
