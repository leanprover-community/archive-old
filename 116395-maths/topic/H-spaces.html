<p>If someone wants to have a look at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/16029">#16029</a> it would be really great. There is the definition of H-spaces and the proof that the path space is a H-space, and thanks to a lot of work and great comments by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="224323">@Junyan Xu</span> I think that the PR looks almost ready to go.</p>
