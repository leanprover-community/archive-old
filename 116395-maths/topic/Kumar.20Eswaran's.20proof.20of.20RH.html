<p>Kumar Eswaran claimed to have proof for RH (back in 2016) and an Indian expert commitee concluded after a year long open review process since February 2020 that the proof is correct. I just want to draw attention to this so maybe the Lean community is interested in starting to verify his works:<br>

<p>If I understand correctly, there is nothing to check here. The error is well-known and has been known for years.</p>

<p>It's not the job of the Lean community to attempt to verify this proof, it's the job of the people who believe the proof to be correct.</p>

<p>Yes, I read now something more about this and indeed it seems strange why the expert committee came to this conclusion.</p>

<p>I ended up reading about this this morning at <a href="https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/q/51965">https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/q/51965</a>, which argues that the expert committee's review suffers from "an apparent lack of understanding of mathematical reasoning"  which "[reduces] any credibility the committee might have had otherwise to zero".</p>
