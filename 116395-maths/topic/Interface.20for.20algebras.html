<p>I'm trying to finish off algebraic closure.</p>
<p>The interface for algebras is really difficult to use as soon as there are a lot of fields involved. <br>
Right now I have fields <code>K</code>, <code>L</code> and <code>M</code>, such that <code>algebra K L</code>, <code>algebra L M</code> and <code>algebra K M</code>, and the ring homs all commute, but not by definition.</p>
<p>If want to turn an L-algebra hom from <code>M</code> into a K-algebra hom. Normally I would use <code>alg_hom.comap</code> to do this, but that would require the canonical homs to commute by definition, which they do not. </p>
<p>I feel like maybe algebra should not be a class, and we should just use explicit homs.</p>

<p>The solution to that is to redefine the Z-algebra instance so that they're defeq.</p>

<p>I have no idea how to do that. I know very little about that part of the library.</p>

<p>This has been a major pain point and major concern for me as well. I have no idea what the library would look like if we use explicit homs. But I fear it won't look like maths as I know it. Otoh, most lean code doesn't look like that anyway...</p>
