<p>Stimulated by the release of Kevin's ICM draft, I forced myself to TeX the expanded written version of my Harvard talk. You can find it <a href="https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~pmassot/files/exposition/why_formalize.pdf">here</a>. The main reason it has taken so long to appear, while several of you, including Kevin, saw early drafts a while ago, is I don't quite know what to do with this text. For now I simply put it on my webpage.  Comments and corrections are very welcome.</p>

<p>Here is one question for the knowledgeable people in the assistance: is there a good paper or blog post or whatever that can be cited to explain how we can trust a computer program to check proofs while everybody knows computer programs are full of bugs? This would include the concept of small kernel vs tactic framework and independent external checkers. This is not the topic of this paper but having something to cite would be very helpful since this is such a natural question to ask.</p>

<p>I would be a bit wary of "frightened" and "fear", just on the principle that people don't like being told they are frightened. Perhaps "wary", which has less negative connotation? But if you want fighting words, they are perfect. :-)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I share the concern, though I also don't see a better alternative. Like Kevin, I prefer "mathematics." I often compare formalization to typesetting; the technology we are using is just a tool to help us do mathematics better, not an end in and of itself. We need to keep saying that over and over until people listen. "Digital mathematics" or "digitized mathematics" emphasizes that it is just a matter of putting mathematics in a certain format so that we can do useful things. "Computer-assisted mathematics" is pretty broad but, I think, also has the right connotations.</p>
<p>When it came to naming, I considered proposing various alternatives to "The Hoskinson Center for Formal Mathematics," like "The Hoskinson Center for Formal Methods in Mathematics" or "The Hoskinson Center for All the Useful Things That Formal Methods and Software Tools Can Do For Mathematics." In the end, we decided that it's hard to beat a short, punchy title, but hopefully it won't obscure the overarching goals.</p>

<p>This naming issue is difficult, but I think the main point is first to make sure people don't confuse different things, especially computer algebra systems and proof assistants and, less crucially, ITP with ATP. So we need a non-ambiguous word, and formalized mathematics seems ok. It can bring the wrong connotation, but here our task is very clear: we must work on making the science fiction parts of my essay real and easy to understand. Then people will get the correct idea, whatever the name (as long as it's not ambiguous).</p>

<p>About formalization, I don't have a better word. I hope the whole text explains what it means. "Computer verified mathematics" clearly puts way to much emphasis on the correctness goal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I completely understand your point here, Patrick, but what this highlights, which I think even "formalized mathematics" misses, is the fact that the computer can <em>automatically</em> verify correctness. At least for me, this is a big part of "the dream", i.e. that referees would no longer need to worry about whether something is correct, and could instead just focus on how interesting the math actually is.</p>

<p>I've been using "machine-checked mathematics" for a while, which I think is about the same as "computer verified" but can sometimes sound less off putting</p>

<p>A very minor point, Patrick, but I stumbled for a second over the word "completeness" in your intro paragraphs. "Completeness and consistency" sounds very much like you're talking logic, but you aren't, I guess you mean complete as in gap-free. Might be worth a few words to clarify this at the start</p>

<p>More seriously, I do think Rob has a point. Completeness and compactness and soundness are somehow the big theorems you learn when you're doing basic stuff like first order propositional calculus.</p>

<p>Right, when you're talking about a syntactic proof system (like Lean) and put the words completeness and consistency next to each other, I read them as "the system can prove every semantic truth" and "the system can't prove false." I'm not saying you should write down these definitions, just that you should define what you mean by completeness to avoid the confusion.</p>

<p>Am I too crazy to dream about a future in which humans will be doing mathematics with some ultra high tech interface that projects things in 3D and people will find and understand results by literally dragging and dropping pieces of a puzzle?</p>

<p>Most "visual programming languages" aren't really competitive with text input, so I'm dubious that this is actually the way of the future. The transhuman proof assistant interface probably looks more like vim <span aria-label="stuck out tongue" class="emoji emoji-1f61b" role="img" title="stuck out tongue">:stuck_out_tongue:</span></p>

<p>Ah, I didn't mean like the mathematical objects would be projected. I meant more the way Mario phrased it. But that's very true about current visual programming interfaces</p>

<p>I thought completeness was fine, it's clear not about logic or real numbers. Consistency is more of a problem, imo. How about just correctness? And a word about being free of circular reasoning?<br>
Formal mathematics does need a bit of rebanding...</p>
