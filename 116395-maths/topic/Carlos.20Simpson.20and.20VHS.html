<p>Carlos Simpson (a mathematician) wrote <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0311260" target="_blank" title="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0311260">this article</a> [NB: now links to ArXiv] on computer theorem proving in 2003. I'd not seen it until today. At the end of it he talks about formalising a proof that some space coming up in the study of variation of Hodge structures is negatively curved. If this sounds like a big deal today (and it does, to me) then perhaps it sounded like a massive deal in 2003. </p>
<p>In the last couple of pages of the paper, Simpson writes down a sketch of how he imagines this theorem should be proved in a computer proof checker. I don't want to quote it all here, it's about three pages long. But it might be interesting to know how far we have gone down this route and how feasible people think this plan is to pull off in Lean.</p>

<p>I particularly like that he refers to what I call mathematics as "standard mathematics" and all the constructive stuff as "exotic mathematics" :D</p>

<p>Incidentally, this is the same Simpson that found a mistake in Voevodsky's papers, and drove Voevodsky towards formalisation.</p>

<p>And here we are... moaning about commutative diagrams and problems with really getting comm.alg. goin.</p>

<p>Do they have these problems in Coq? That was the system Carlos had experience in. </p>
<p>Of course the moans are only that stuff is annoyingly fiddly, not that it is impossible...</p>

<p>I think we're about halfway through the sketch and in the middle of the paragraph about sheaves</p>

<p>My link above now points to the 2004 version of the article on ArXiv. It seems to me that we are basically on the last page of the article (p25), modulo para on p24 which mentions the construction going from schemes over C (which we have) to complex manifolds (which we have). </p>
<p>I think that it is interesting to note that whilst this article was written by a mathematician in 2003, the vision he spells out involves formalising precisely the things (manifolds, schemes, topological groups, sheaves) which mathematicians in 2018-20 were pushing to get, completely independently.</p>

<p>Things like Hilbert Basis? And I'm in the middle of Nullstellensatz? Of course Kenny's absence this year has slowed things down but on the other hand analysis is now moving much faster.</p>
