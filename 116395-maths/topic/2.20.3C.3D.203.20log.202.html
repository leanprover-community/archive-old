<p>Can anyone think of an easy maths proof of <code>2 &lt;= 3 log 2</code> in the reals, preferably one that is also easy in mathlib? The inequality is only just true, and my usual answer would be "evaluate some decimal places" but <code>log</code> is noncomputable. That means my usual answer would become "evaluate some terms of the series expansion, and use that the error of an alternating series truncation is at most the first omitted term", but that is a lot of machinery.</p>

<p>Take exp of both sides (exp is monotonic) and now you have to prove e^2 &lt;= 8, which is feasible because we have good bounds for e.</p>

<p>Ah, I didn't look very hard for bounds, but now I know they're there I'm sure I can find them - thanks</p>

<p>Ah, data.complex.exponential_bounds - thanks!</p>

<p>There's also some bounds on <code>log 2</code> itself which could help do it directly!</p>
