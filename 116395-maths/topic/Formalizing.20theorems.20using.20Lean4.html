<p>My project advisor and I are looking at lean as a possible field for my final UG project. We are looking to formalize one of these proofs:-<br>
Stickelberger's Theorem<br>
Gelford-Schneider Theorem.<br>
Any ideas on how feasible it is to formalize these proofs in Lean4  in 4 months? I have a basic understanding of Lean4 as a programming language.</p>

<p>I think it would be better to use Lean 3 since mathlib is still on Lean 3.</p>

<p>Stickelbergerâ€™s Theorem about the discriminant? It would be very nice to have it in mathlib! But you need quite a lot of algebraic number theory, so I would suggest to use mathlib, so Lean 3.</p>

<p>There's the recent work <a href="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Lindemann-Weierstrass.20theorem.20almost.20done">formalizing Lindemann-Weierstrass</a> which also concerns transcendence but doesn't imply Gelford-Schneider or vice versa (both are consequences of Baker's theorem though).</p>

<p>Hi, thank you for the suggestion. What I had in mind was Stickelberger's theorem on the annihilation of class groups of cyclotomic fields. </p>
<p>I have no experience with Lean. So the two suggestions (Sticekelber's theorem in algebraic number theory versus Gelfond--Schneider in transcendental number theory) above are somewhat disjoint; I am hoping that at least one of them will be a suitable undergraduate thesis problem for Suryansh (who has a little bit of experience with Lean).</p>

<p>Both of those are impossible in lean 4 and both would be attemptable in lean 3 but whether the student finishes would depend on how hard they worked, they would both be substantial projects.</p>

<p>But any partial result in that direction would be a more than welcomed contribution to mathlib, so don't hesitate to try!</p>

<p>Yes indeed, that's used quite heavily for showing primality of ideals. We made a couple of definitions of ideal norm and show they agree, so it should be usable for both definitions fairly easily</p>
