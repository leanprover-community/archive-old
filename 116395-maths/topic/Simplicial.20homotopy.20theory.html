<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I'm interested in beginning to formalize some elements of simplicial homotopy theory - two milestones I have in mind are the standard model structure on the category of simplicial sets and the Dold-Kan correspondence. Has anyone worked on this at all? (I know about the "sset" branch of mathlib, which is presumably where such an effort would start.)</p>

<p>I think <code>sset</code> is the most advanced in that direction! Go for it.</p>
