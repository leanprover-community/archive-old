<p>I am trying to understand how instances work and I ran across the following examples.</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">lemma</span> <span class="n">one</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">S</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span><span class="bp">*</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">hs</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">integral_domain</span> <span class="n">S</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">comm_cancel_monoid_with_zero</span> <span class="n">S</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="kd">by</span> <span class="n">apply_instance</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>is OK, while</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">lemma</span> <span class="n">two</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">S</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span><span class="bp">*</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">ring</span> <span class="n">S</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">ℤ</span> <span class="bp">≃+*</span> <span class="n">S</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">comm_cancel_monoid_with_zero</span> <span class="n">S</span> <span class="o">:=</span>
<span class="kd">begin</span>
  <span class="k">have</span> <span class="n">hs</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">integral_domain</span> <span class="n">S</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="gr">sorry</span><span class="o">,</span>
  <span class="n">apply_instance</span>
<span class="kd">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>is not OK (a part from the fact that I can prove <code>hs</code> using <code>f</code>, but I've sorried it to be short). So I understand that  when Lean looks for assumptions that would match instances, it looks in the  hypothesis of the statement, but not on "new" ones. Is it really so? If yes, I have two questions:<br>
1) What is the difference between an "assumed" hypothesis and one which has been "constructed" along the way?<br>
2) How to <code>apply_instance</code> if the needed assumption was not part of the hypothesis, as in my <code>lemma two</code>?</p>

<p>For question 2, <code>haveI</code>or <code>letI</code> makes <code>hs</code> an instance, meaning that the system then finds it like it was written <code>[...]</code> in the statement.</p>

<p>The "system" which makes <code>apply_instance</code> work is called the type class inference system. It is initialised at the beginning of a proof in the following way: Lean looks at everything before the colon which is a term of a typeclass (like your first <code>hs</code>) and puts it into the system. Then, by default, it never puts anything else into the system.</p>
<p>To make your lemma 2 work you need to put <code>haveI : integral_domain S</code> (or probably <code>letI : integral_domain S</code> because I think it's data) -- this tactic specifically is designed to change the system.</p>

<p>Wow, perfect! Thanks (indeed, it works): the nice caveat is that it does not accept my sorry, the docs says</p>
<p>The syntax is the same as have, but the proof-omitted version is not supported. For this one must write have : t, { &lt;proof&gt; }, resetI, &lt;proof&gt;.</p>

<p>Note that, as Patrick reminded us yesterday (and Mario told me about a year ago), you don't need hs to be in square brackets in lemma 1 -- Lean just looks at everything before the colon. The reason you should put <code>[integral_domain S]</code> in square brackets instead is for people who want to <em>use</em> your lemma, not to help you prove it yourself.</p>

<p>Meaning it could be in curly ones? (You can also simply point at Patrick's chat)</p>

<p>Yes, any terms of type <code>C</code> where <code>C</code> is in a class, if they're defined before the colon, will end up in the instance cache. It doesn't matter what brackets are being used, I believe...</p>
