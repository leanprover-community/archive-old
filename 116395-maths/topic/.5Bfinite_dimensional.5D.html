<p>In <code>linear_algebra.finite_dimensional</code> <code>finite_dimensional</code> is defined as a reducible def (and not a structure or class) but later on in the file it is used in square brackets. What's going on there? Does this work?</p>

<p>I guess since it's just an abbreviation for <code>is_noetherian</code> it is actually a class.</p>

<p>Is this causing you some trouble? Or are you just curious? (Me too.)<br>
We had a similar sort of thing in the category theory library for a while where we tried to <code>def</code> "having limits of shape K" as a function: having a limit of every diagram of shape K. It seemed to work fine for a while but then in more complicated cases the elaborator got confused. Eventually we turned it back into a class (structure) with one field.</p>

<p>I was just talking to Kenny about his new push for Galois theory (on some private Imperial repo which is half-finished and then when Kenny went to the US and Chris stopped work on algebraic closure, stalled).</p>

<p>I'm just wondering if you (or Kenny) got some mysterious error related to type classes, or were just reading the source and noticed that it looked funny.</p>
