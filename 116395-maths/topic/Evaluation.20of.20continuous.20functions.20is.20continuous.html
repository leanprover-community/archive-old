Hausdorff spaces but not in general. This one is the precise condition on X needed for the<br>

<p>These are good questions. I would be prepared to believe that if <code>X</code> is compact but not Hausdorff, then since maps into a Hausdorff space (e.g. metric space) <code>Y</code> factor through the maximal Hausdorff quotient <code>X -&gt; X'</code> of <code>X</code>, then maybe the induced map <code>C(X', Y) -&gt; C(X, Y)</code> is a homeomorphism--though it's not obvious to me. Here I'm always giving <code>C(-, -)</code> the compact-open topology. If this is right then it would explain why there are these two theorems with conclusions of the same form.</p>
<p>Math-wise there is another question of whether the compact-open topology on <code>C(X, Y)</code> is the same as something coming from a metric when <code>X</code> is compact and <code>Y</code> a metric space. Based on a brief inspection, it looks like mathlib knows this is the case, but I don't have time to look at it further--I vaguely recall <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="240862">@Oliver Nash</span> proving some statement like this, maybe this one?</p>

<p>OK now I think that what I said in the first paragraph probably is in fact easy (compact subsets of <code>X'</code> are sufficiently closely related to compact subsets of <code>X</code> to see that the topologies are the same).</p>

<p>No it is the same topology (provably, but I think it has been setup carefully so it is definitional). Compact open topology is a generalization of the usual uniform convergence topology</p>
