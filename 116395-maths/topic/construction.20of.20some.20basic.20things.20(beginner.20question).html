<p>Hi, folk.</p>
<p>I'm Dean.</p>
<p>I just went through the Lean 4 tutorial, which is currently incomplete. I was hoping I could come here with a list of things I want to patch up. It's a long one, but definitely I want to patch as much of these things as possible so passing comments are appreciated.</p>
<ul>
<li>a : A gives id_a : a =_A a</li>
<li>p : a = b, q : b = c gives p : a = c</li>
<li>p : a = b gives p : b = a by switch_A</li>
<li>p : X -&gt; Prop, t: ev_x (p), s : x =_X y gives t : ev_y(p)  [replacement - the most important to me on this list]</li>
<li>
<p>the theorems involved in the equality type</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A unit type with a constituent const : unit</p>
</li>
<li>A theorem: \forall x : unit, x = const</li>
</ul>
<p>The tutorial for Lean 4 describes the use of simp, but I don't want this for now (I'm just a beginner).</p>

<p>I think the chapter in <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/">#tpil4</a> on equality should be useful to you.</p>
