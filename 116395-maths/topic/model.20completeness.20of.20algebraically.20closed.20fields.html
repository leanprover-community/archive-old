<p>Is it possible to (a) prove that the first order theory of algebraically closed fields is complete (via quantifier elimination or otherwise) and (b) use such a statement/proof to actually deduce things about the complex numbers (or arbitrary algebraically closed fields)?</p>
<p>For instance, I am thinking that Hilbert's Nullstellensatz can be proved quite quickly using quantifier elimination.</p>

<p>What about focusing on quantifier elimination?  For algebraically closed fields, quantifier elimination and elimination theory are very close and formalizing this might be more at hand?</p>

<p>For instance, is it in theory possible in Lean to prove quantifier elimination by some form of induction on propositions, to show that every proposition reduces to true or false constructively?  Is there an "induction on proposition"?</p>

<p>Something along the lines of: a proposition either begins with a <code>\exist</code> or a <code>\forall</code>.  in the first case, do something, in the second case, negate, push negations through and repeat</p>

<p>yeah that should be fun to do in Lean, it will probably teach you a lot</p>

<p>oh this uses the EGA version of constructible, with retrocompact in, so the link to constructible I sent is no good</p>

<p>right, I guess it has to use this version because there are no Noetherian hypotheses</p>

<p>I’m starting to adapt some flypitch to conventions that seem to match the rest of mathlib a little better at a branch, <code>mathlib:fol_project</code>.</p>

<p>I’m still not particularly close, but I have a definition of definable sets that doesn’t require formulas.</p>

<p>One thing I noticed is that I couldn’t find a super-suitable definition of the Boolean algebra generated by a particular subset. Perhaps I just need to look again, but I think that’d be useful for defining constructible</p>
