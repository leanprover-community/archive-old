<p>Did we ever get groups acting on sets? [or even monoids acting on sets?]. The reason I ask is that I just tried to define groups acting on abelian groups and I realised I can't use <code>*</code> because the action is <code>G -&gt; M -&gt; M</code>. Has a decision been made about notation for groups acting on anything other than themselves?</p>

<p>Yes, these are in mathlib, and you want to use <code>smul</code>, I think.</p>

<p><code>\bullet</code></p>

<p>Apparently it's <code>\bu</code> now. And I have to import <code>algebra.module</code> to get the notation :-) It should be some far more primitive thing. Is the fact that the notation is defined in algebra.module evidence that we don't have groups acting on sets yet?</p>

<p>also when I did it myself I used <code>\ci</code></p>
