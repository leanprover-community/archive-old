<p>I have wip PR ( <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/12537">#12537</a> ) that would add ~200 lines to the balanced set part in <code>analysis.seminorm</code>. If I remember correctly there was a consensus to that this file is already large enough and might be ripe for splitting up. I don't remember whether that was before the gauge part left or after. So my question is whether we should split <code>seminorm</code>further or just put the balanced hull/core stuff in a new file  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="387244">@Yaël Dillies</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="260507">@Heather Macbeth</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="246273">@Bhavik Mehta</span></p>

<p>Yes, I am planning on splitting this up further.</p>

<p>What should we name it? I was happy with <code>analysis.convex.balanced</code></p>

<p>I know that I am not happy with putting everything in <code>analysis.convex</code> <span aria-label="laughing" class="emoji emoji-1f606" role="img" title="laughing">:laughing:</span> In the case of balanced sets we don't even need an order on the underlying field/ring, so there is not even a notion of convexity. My suggestion is still <code>analysis.locally_convex</code> not because everything is locally convex, but all the topics are related and used for locally convex spaces. There is also the possibility to make a folder (something like) <code>analysis.module</code> for topics about modules over normed fields/rings. The later is probably more in line with the rest of the naming convention of mathlib.</p>

<p>another possibility would be <code>analysis.normed.module</code>, but thatt sounds like having a norm on the module</p>

<p>another option (which would lead to less bike-shedding) is to put everything in <code>analysis</code> until that folder becomes too large and then we can decide what to group together</p>

<p>It could, but that would mean we should split up <code>anaylsis.convex.basic</code> further (which is going to happeny because we want to turn the dependency of <code>convex</code> and <code>star_convex</code> around).</p>

<p>Nobody else seems to care and we both like <code>analysis.locally_convex.basic</code>, we should use that. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="387244">@Yaël Dillies</span> do you want to do the split, or should I do it? I have a few future PRs that add stuff to the seminorm file, so I am waiting with those until the file is divided.</p>
