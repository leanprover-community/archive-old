<p>Rumor has it that an algorithm is a valid proof. Is there an example of an algorithmic proof in Lean?</p>

<p>I don't either, actually. But I have heard many times that "Programs are proofs" and "Constructive Proofs are programs" by Curry Howard. I can "sort-of, maybe, sometimes (SMS) " agree with constructive proofs being programs, under a lot of assumptions. But "programs are proofs" is a direction that I'm "sort-of, maybe, sometimes" wresting with. I have many working GCD algorithms (e.g. NAT, POlYNOMIALS, etc.) and I'm trying to prove them "correct". That is, I'm trying to prove that they fulfill a specification. The specification is "sort-of, maybe, sometimes" a set of logical definitions and axioms, (e.g. gcd(x,y) == gcd(y,x) )</p>
<p>The language of the program (in this case, lisp) is irrelevant since it should be possible to translate a proof into a lambda form expressible in lisp. Given that the lambda form came from a proof with its associated definitions and axioms, it should be possible to "prove" the lambda form, that is, to prove the program.</p>
<p>So the fundamental tasks are to (1) turn a gcd proof into a program and (2) to turn the program into a gcd proof. I am pondering a way to take the lowest level Lean output format into lisp.</p>
<p>Given that this is research (aka creative reuse :-) ) I was hoping for working examples to SMS reasoning.</p>
<p>The other working assumption is that I'm just confused but that's more of an axiom than an assumption.</p>

<p>Axiom's type system is well beyond anything directly coded in lisp. Axiom knows the types of everything, everywhere, at all times (dependent types) and computes them in the compiler (or it won't compile). The interpreter computes them but has heuristics because the compile-time types are undecidable.</p>

<p>I thought of trying to translate Coq's Groebner basis proof to Lean but there are a lot of issues to handle (e.g. term ordering) which have nothing to do with the issue. I have a much more modest goal of proving Axiom's 22 GCD algorithms using Lean. But I would like the proofs to "round trip" (spad-&gt;lean-&gt;spad).</p>

<p>An expected result of my research (hmm, where is my cap and gown?) is that the CIC rules are used on the Axiom side while proving programs. That's why I was trying to reverse engineer Lean's current rule set. It really would help to include a few comments in the source code.</p>

<p>Somehow we need to cross the "computational mathematics" bridge between proof tools and computer algebra. Since Axiom has an explicit scaffold of group theory (rather than general rewrite rules like Mathematica) it seems like the best bet to merge these two streams. James Davenport is the only person I've seen who is referenced in both (nearly disjoint) sets of bibliographies.</p>

<p>It has monoid, groups, rings, fields, etc., all implemented as a hierarchy of typeclasses. I'm decorating the typeclasses with axioms and defintions and decorating the implementations (we call them domains, aka carriers and algorithms) with axioms, definitions, and lemmas. For example, NAT (which Axiom calls NonNegativeIntegers) has the usual decorations.</p>

<p>Computational Mathematics is a subject that covers both proofs and computer algebra. So far, nobody as far as I know has "crossed the divide". There are examples, such as Coq's Groebner basis work, but no general convergence.</p>
<p>I find this unacceptable and, from all I've seen, there is a merger possible. That, of course, is a research statement and is up to me to show.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> But this means that sooner or later all mathematicians will move to a <code>mathlib_2</code> project built on top of <code>mathlib</code> and <code>set.mm.lean</code>. Because once a bunch of nice results are available there, we will want to use them. And we won't bother with reproving them in a "clean" or "native" setting. I'm not sure about all the implications. Part of me thinks that this is a wonderful world, where we can just import stuff from metamath. But maybe it also leads to fragmentation? How do you feel about this yourself?</p>

<p>Originally, mathlib was designed to be the monolith that it is because of maintenance questions. It is separate from lean repo because different teams work on the two projects. There is no need for mathlib to eat all other projects, only projects that are maintained by members of the mathlib team, because these are the ones that benefit the most from the interaction between mathlib and the project. For separately maintained projects (particularly those with their own team and contribution schedule), keeping them out of mathlib is reasonable.</p>

<p>But fragmentation leads to abandonware and bitrot. Somehow all these other projects need to keep up with mathlib and its frequent refactors. By far the easiest way to do this is to make sure they end up as part of mathlib. This is what I'm worried about.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> I'm reading your MetaMath Zero paper. You mentioned "proof to the x86 architecture".</p>
<p>I worked in security and developed the semantics of the x86 architecture. The input is binary (since we were reverse engineering malware and need to know EXACTLY what the malware does). The output is in several formats. One format is called Conditional-Concurrent assignment (CCA). Basically it rolls a bunch of statements under a logical condition which can be combined with other conditions. If you want to ensure you're getting the right code executed you can compile your program and ask for the assembler output from my program, thus "round-tripping" your code.</p>
<p>The "Intel Instruction Semantics Generator" (<a href="http://daly.axiom-developer.org/TimothyDaly_files/publications/sei/intel/intel.pdf" target="_blank" title="http://daly.axiom-developer.org/TimothyDaly_files/publications/sei/intel/intel.pdf">http://daly.axiom-developer.org/TimothyDaly_files/publications/sei/intel/intel.pdf</a>) is a literate program containing both the source code and the documentation, a fair amount of which is the individual intel instruction semantics.<br>
It is an SEI/CERT research report I did at CMU.</p>
<p>The x86 architecture, while widely used is, I can safely say based on my experience, rather a challenge to understand at the logical / semantics layer. It is especially challenging when you automate semantic generation. My advice to you would be to find the smallest possible subset (regardless of efficiency). Perhaps it might make sense to construct mealy / moore state machines for your logical operations and build semantics on verified versions of that.</p>

<p>I've been doing open source development since 1997 (the slashdot era). An Axiom "release" every 2 months for a large code base (&gt;1M lines) costs me about 1 week. So if you build something large and complex, expect that it will come to dominate your time. I can't even read some of the posts here.

<p>You are deep in the religion. It took me 10 courses (some of which you attended) to be able to read pages of greek rules. I've invested about 4 years in the proof areas so far and I still struggle with Coq/Lean/Agda/Idris/Isabelle, not to mention reading ANY paper in the proof literature. As I mentioned before, a computer algebra colleague with 40 years in the computational mathematics business, asked in a seminar "What is that funny fraction?" when confronted with a proof rule.</p>
<p>Believe me, unless you do this every day, a lot of it is completely opaque. I don't know who can possibly maintain it without words. The papers that get published usually only talk about "the interesting bits". And if you try to go back to Frege, like I did, you find his notation opaque. </p>
<p>Axiom, which accepts normal algebra-looking equations, is considered a "steep learning curve". Lean is a vertical smooth wall to most people.</p>

<p>Another long-term issue with C++ is.... which C++ "standard"? C++ emits a new standard every few years so the C++ you write may not compile in the future. As an example, Axiom compiles to C under the covers. One of the issues is that the C library implementation has changed which caused an amazing amount of maintenance grief. The new "C++ standard" will include "concepts" which will not compile in earlier versions. I also maintained the open source project Magnus (<a href="https://github.com/markuspf/magnus" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/markuspf/magnus">https://github.com/markuspf/magnus</a>) which is a C++ computer algebra program that does Infinite Group Theory. Keeping that alive in C++ is a nightmare.  (Did you know that you can construct classes IN THE ARGUMENT LIST of a function definition at compile time?</p>

<p>If a compiler update breaks your code, then you probably relied on UB; but it is very well possible that a <em>standard</em> update breaks your code.

<p>One very nice thing of MM and MM0 is that they decouple the generation and storage of proofs. You can use whatever language you fancy to create and edit proofs. Then you save them in a (rather) simple format, specified independently of any language or tool, and you are perfectly interoperable with any other proof written for the same system. I don't know much about Lean, but I believe this should be the way to go for whoever wants to store information (not just proofs) in a durable fashion.</p>
<p>Together with durability, it also gives everybody the power to use their preferred tools and develop new tools using their preferred languages. This is pretty standard practice on the MM mailing list.</p>

<p>Well... "all of mathematics" is a big reach. I think at some point <code>mathlib</code> is going to need to start picking some more precise boundaries. I think if you interpret "all of mathematics" as "a strong undergradute/masters education at top maths departments", it looks a lot more manageable.</p>

<p>Well... "all of mathematics" is a big reach. I think at some point <code>mathlib</code> is going to need to start picking some more precise boundaries. I think if you interpret "all of mathematics" as "a strong undergradute/masters education at top maths departments", it looks a lot more manageable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's basically the goal of the Xena project, and I am hoping that this is a sufficiently "small" goal that it will be both (a) feasible and (b) not impossible to curate. It seems to me to be a very reasonable boundary for mathlib. If you look at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-perfectoid-spaces/tree/master/src/for_mathlib" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-perfectoid-spaces/tree/master/src/for_mathlib">the <code>for_mathlib</code> directory</a> in the perfectoid project you can see that the stuff that ends up in there is either completely foundational (e.g. lemmas on uniform spaces/with_zero/nnreal) or stuff which people meet in the 4 year MSc course at Imperial (normed spaces, polynomials, primes, submodules etc). Stuff like 3200 LOC on the theory of valuations taking values in some funny linearly ordered monoid, which is at the heart of the definition of an adic space, is not pencilled in to go in there because you have to draw a line somewhere and we certainly don't teach that to the MSc students unless they're doing a specialised project. I agree that this is an interesting long-term question.</p>

<p>My thinking currently is "oh look, here are a ton of young mathematicians which I have easy access to, if I go on about Lean all the bloody time then a few of them will get interested and start formalising stuff which they're seeing in lectures, and eventually there will be enough of them to make more of our degree just magically appear in mathlib".

<p>Axiom was one of "the big 3" (Mathematica, Maple, and Axiom). Axiom was sold commercially for a while and then withdrawn and given to me. Maple was sold to a Japanese company. Mathematica still exists but there are problems. The big problem is that companies last, on average, 15 years. A second problem is that, because MMA is the primary company asset it would need to be sold rather than open sourced, as happened with Macsyma from Symbolics when they went under.</p>
<p>Can you imagine the "hole" that will develop in mathematics when Mathematica is no longer available?</p>
<p>Axiom is trying to build a long term, solid foundation for computational mathematics. While it covers areas of computer algebra it has so far neglected the proof area. The merger of these two streams of computational mathematics, to provide a stable, proven basis is the project goal. </p>

<p>I know life isn't as easy as this really, but that's the vague plan at this point.

<p>mathematics is not entirely forever, either. you can see the effect of "product cycles" in math as well, where old and clumsy ui is deprecated in favor of new and snappy ui and people using the new ui have a hard time working with the old ui. notation changes, the underlying abstractions and intuitions change, and the writing styles of papers change.<br>
as a result, old papers can be pretty hard to read, and old results are adapted to the new ui.<br>
itp is still relatively young and thus evolving through these cycles more quickly, especially with good ui being so important to the area. give it some time, let it evolve and maybe we will eventually be able to meet the 30 year horizon when we are sufficiently happy with the ui we've got!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, mathematical software doesn't "evolve". People always start from scratch. As I mentioned above, there are hundreds of computer algebra systems, many started with the insight that C++ allows operator overloading so...Hey! We can do polynomials! These computer algebra systems were academic "hand waving" and ended up contributing nothing but papers to the field.</p>
<p>The big systems like Mathematica, Maple, and Axiom had many people contributing in a similar style over many years. Most important is that they had a continuous stream of funding.</p>
<p>Systems like Sage and Magnus got academic funding for a couple years. When the money ran out they ran into trouble. William Stein left the University of Washington to try to save Sage.</p>
<p>Coq seems to have a funding stream that has continued over many years. If Lean gets enough places using it for teaching and some research mathematicians using it, then it might survive. But developing it with "this week's game" mindset means you can't build on the work.</p>
<p>So my question becomes "Is Lean going to be around in 5 years?" Surely if we want to build a stable base that mathematicians can use both for teaching and research, we want a system that isn't going to devolve into papers.</p>
<p>Of all the software projects I've done over the last 50 years, only the mathematics software has any sign of being "forever". Everything else I've written disappeared.</p>

<p>i don't think that we always start from scratch. you can write translators like mario did, port stuff manually like in mathlib in the past or add some sort of backwards compatibility like what has been discussed for lean 4 where lean 3 code could be imported into lean 4.</p>
<p>sure, there's a compromise - you most certainly cannot expect users to keep up with evolution that is too frequent, and hence you need to listen to your userbase. from what i've gathered over my time here, most people would welcome a switch to lean 4 in order to fix some of the shortcomings of lean 3. i did not get the impression that lean is developed with a "this week's game" mindset.</p>
<p>whether lean will be around in 5 years does not just depend on whether lean is retaining backwards compatibility, it might also depend on exactly the fact that lean is willing to evolve and cater to the needs of its users.</p>

<p>Whatever fancy things there might be, we're still starting from scratch.</p>

<p>there was some talk here about being able to import lean 3 code into lean 4, not sure whether that is actually feasible. i'll ask sebastian when he's back from vacation ;)</p>

<p>I have no real idea about when we will be able to start thinking about these question seriously.</p>

<p>on an unrelated note, i think it would be better to have discussions like this in #general</p>

<p>Actually, I fear I sound too negative and should stop. I really like Lean and am looking at ways to use it from Axiom.</p>

<p>This paper might be of interest as a "crossover" between logic and computer algebra:<br>

<p>Does Lean support first-class dependent types? The paper (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.1323.pdf" target="_blank" title="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.1323.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.1323.pdf</a>) Type Classes for mathematics in type theory talked about essentially this in Coq</p>
