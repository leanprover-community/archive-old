<p>I would like to define moment generating functions and I think a natural way to do so is through Laplace transforms. Is anyone working on this? </p>
<p>I have played around with a few definitions but I'm not sure whether my definition is the correct generality for mathlib. Would an expert mind taking a look at it here: <a href="https://github.com/JasonKYi/probability_theory/blob/main/src/laplace.lean#L17">https://github.com/JasonKYi/probability_theory/blob/main/src/laplace.lean#L17</a></p>
