<p>I'm good at onboarding maths  undergraduates. But it's a changing terrain. In 2018 the question from the UGs was "do we have undergraduate thing X" and my answer was almost always "no, but we want that in mathlib so why don't you go away and make it" and the answer to "I'm looking for a project to help me learn Lean at a higher level" was "great, can you make bundled subsemirings, just copy submonoids" and people could be really helpful towards driving this community project forwards. </p>
<p>Lately, mathlib-helping projects suitable for first year undergraduates have become much harder for me to construct. One of the reasons for this is that in the lean code I'm writing as part of my research, the issues I'm running into involve technical things like normal closures or complex calculations in an abelian category, and it's all a bit much for first years.</p>
<p>On the other hand, looking at what people like <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="481963">@David Loeffler</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="479359">@Michael Stoll</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="389019">@Chris Birkbeck</span> are doing -- you're all engaging with mathematics that I learnt in Cambridge Part III and my experience with working at this level is that projects suitable for first year undergraduates do show up sometimes</p>

<p>If there is anyone who feels they might have a good project suitable for a first or second year undergraduate then I can supervise it as part of my summer projects this year. I'll be working with over 20 maths undergraduates. Obviously I have a few ideas for projects myself, mostly completely unrelated to mathlib.</p>

<p>I have a few ideas of things that undergraduates might want to have a look at. For example, proving that cotangent identity that comes up when one looks at modular forms : <a href="/user_uploads/3121/dVTQztJWawpeVF9foCB4TBpD/image.png">image.png</a> </p>

<p>I believe that there are still some low-hanging fruits in linear algebra that could make a great contribution to mathlib for a first or second year undergraduate.<br>
This winter I realized as I was doing representation theory that we had very few properties of the trace of a linear map, and that it was very annoying to prove any of them since the trace was defined in terms of the matrix trace, so we had to drop down to matrices everytime. Therefore, I proved that the current definition was equivalent to the basis-free definition of the trace in <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/trace_eq_contract">docs#trace_eq_contract</a> and used this to prove a bunch of basic properties that I needed.<br>
It could be a great first project for someone to do the same with the determinant, i.e. prove that the current matrix definition is equivalent to the basis-free definition in terms of exterior powers (which would probably involve first improving the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/exterior_algebra">docs#exterior_algebra</a> API).

<p>Mathlib seems quite light on numerical analysis at the moment, and there was a Part 1B short course on Numerical Analysis in my time - we've got Gram-Schmidt, but as far as I can see (and e.g. from <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/28f7172e9677fd412cdd500c914d18d423846715/docs/undergrad.yaml">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/28f7172e9677fd412cdd500c914d18d423846715/docs/undergrad.yaml</a>) we don't yet have any numerical integration. This could have the nice property that the output is procedures you can actually evaluate/get meaningful answers out of/visualise.</p>

<p>Yes, it would be very nice to have basic numerical analysis in mathlib. I don't think we can hope to have effective implementations in Lean 3, but we can definitely prove theoretical properties, say of basic numerical integration methods.</p>

<p>Oh that reminds me of another nice project, it should be possible to make a nice implementation of interval or ball arithmetic, defining operations on intervals of reals as the smallest interval containing the operation applied to. One could then show some algebraic properties of these things (some form of associativity / commutativity may hold), and teach norm_num to simplify some expressions involving these things with rational endpoints. Would be nice to then use it to give some nice estimates of constants.</p>

<p>I think anyone can make up large numbers of these projects by picking up a textbook and trying to do the exercises.</p>

<p>(... as long as it's a textbook where the theory itself is already in mathlib in a satisfactory state; that's why I took Galois theory for my examples, but surely there are other areas that would work too)</p>

<p>Yeah another one of the projects does involve formalising an appropriate undergraduate textbook</p>
