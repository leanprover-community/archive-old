<p>Do people know of a filter definition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitopological_space">bicompactness</a>?</p>

<p>Why do we want this notion? I've never heard of it. I can think of 100 things I have heard of which we don't have and which would perhaps be more profitable to work on. Does anyone serious use this notion? Maybe they do -- I'm just asking</p>

<p>I don't even understand the definition. What's this thing about it must contain an element from each topology? What must? How about we add the empty set? That's in both </p>
<p>Is it different to the topology generated by the two topologies being compact?</p>

<p>A bi-group is a type with two group structures. We say it's bi-abelian if both of them are abelian. Let's not put this in mathlib.</p>

<p>This is because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_theory_for_distributive_lattices">duality theory for distributive lattices</a>. It is genuinely useful, Kevin <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>

<p>Do you even understand what is written on Wikipedia? It seems like a very vague comment about how something must contain an open from each topology.</p>

<p>That comment made me wonder about whether this stuff was just written by a randomer and was never clarified because this stuff is never used</p>

<p>No, I don't understand that offhand comment because it seems like it adds a condition after the main sentence. However, I found <a href="https://alexhkurz.github.io/papers/PairwiseStoneRevised.pdf">the original paper</a>.</p>
