<p>I've made lots of progress for (Lawvere-Tierney) sheaves in a topos, which should specialise nicely to give the category of sheaves over a Grothendieck site. My question is: what do the people who know about sheaves in geometry want? Eg if I give you a (black-box) functor which is left adjoint to inclusion of presheaves into sheaves, and a proof that it preserves finite limits would you be happy?</p>

<p>I thought about exactly this question a few months ago. Unfortunately, I think my notes on the subject might be in my office which I cannot get into...</p>
