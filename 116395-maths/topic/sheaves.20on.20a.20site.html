<p>I've just kicked <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/4608">#4608</a> on the merge queue. Major kudos to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="246273">@Bhavik Mehta</span> <br>
You might know that at Lean Together 2019, I gave a talk titled "Sheaves in Lean". I gave a report on how I was trying to do the stuff that Bhavik has now accomplished. The talk was nice, but the project failed miserably. I am really happy that the problem was me, and not the sheaves!</p>

<p>This was a really nice PR. There is still work to do though. We still cannot state the first exercise in chapter 2 of Hartshorne because it involves sheafification of a presheaf of abelian groups. But we're getting there.</p>
