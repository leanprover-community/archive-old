<p>I've realized that two things don't fit nicely into the current design of <code>manifold_with_corners</code>. I need neither of them in the nearest future but I think that we should have them in mind (or decide that we're not going to fit them into the definition).</p>
<ol>
<li>Orbifolds. Probably, they deserve a separate definition but I don't like the idea of duplicating tons of code.</li>
<li>Complex manifolds with corners. E.g., closed triangles on the complex plane. Since complex derivative preserves angles, we either need a model space with all possible angles (and it becomes even more complicated in higher dimension), or do some huge refactor (e.g., drop <code>charted_space</code> and <code>chart_at</code>, use <code>local_equiv</code>s with additional properties instead of <code>local_homeomorph</code>s as charts).<br>

<p>One more question: should we accept <code>{(x, y) | 0 ≤ y ≤ x²}</code> as a manifold with corners? Here the issue is that we don't have unique differentiability at zero.</p>

<p>The orbifold question is trickier. Those definitely exist and indeed redoing everything from scratch would be painful. But I don't think we know enough about formalizing manifolds to think about orbifolds. We first need to actually use manifolds in Lean.</p>

<p>Orbifolds can at least be charted spaces, so we don't need to start right from the beginning.</p>

<p>Then we should have a typeclass saying "the group is always trivial", and get our old local homeomorphism in this case.</p>

<p>I guess, it will be hard to do this without breaking some definitional equalities, so probably we'll need more maps and some equality axioms between them.</p>

<p>Actually, I was thinking about extra requirements I need to show that for a smooth map <code>f : M → N</code> from a manifold to a manifold of larger dimension, the complement to the range is dense (needed for the weak Whitney's embedding theorem), then somehow switched to "what other strange things are (not) allowed by our definitions?"</p>

<p>As for orbifolds, my main problem with them is that the tangent bundle does not really exist (as a locally trivial vector bundle in the usual sense), the tangent map is not defined in the usual sense either, and so on. So everything we've constructed in the manifolds library does not even make sense for them. My impression is that the right context to work with orbifolds is rather algebraic varieties, so a completely different setup (and a completely different language).</p>

<p>Another approach to this, which I don't think has ever been formalized, is via something like synthetic differential geometry (e.g. as in <a href="http://tildeweb.au.dk/au76680/sdg99.pdf">http://tildeweb.au.dk/au76680/sdg99.pdf</a> ) I also don't know if anyone has developed a synthetic approach to manifolds with corners, but it can certainly be done.</p>
