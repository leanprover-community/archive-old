<p>I have a reverse mathematics question for the algebraists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are the weakest conditions on a ring <code>R</code> so that any linearly independent set in an <code>R</code>-module <code>M</code> has cardinality bounded by any basis for <code>M</code>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently in mathlib we just have this for <code>division_ring</code> (maybe that is even still in the <a href="https://bit.ly/3kaztxO">#queue</a>, and we only have it for fields?)</p>
<p>If you have a _finite_ basis, then any ring satisfying the strong rank condition has this property (proof: build a linear map R^i to R^b by taking coordinates of each element of the linearly independent set, show this is injective because the set is independent, and then by definition of the strong rank condition i &lt;= b) (EDIT: you need a tiny bit of extra work to show the linearly independent set must be finite, by showing any finite subset of it has bounded cardinality, before you can actually apply the strong rank condition).</p>
<p>As a consequence, this is true (for finite bases) for any left-noetherian ring and any commutative ring.</p>
<p>But what is true in the infinite case? I have no idea.</p>
<p>(Relatedly, I've already got the proof that any basis has cardinality bounded by any spanning set, as soon as the ring satisfies the rank condition; so including all left-noetherian and all commutative rings, without any finiteness assumptions.)</p>

<p>Through ordinal induction, you can extend that to infinite bases too.</p>

<p>Can't find it in Lang or Dummit &amp; Foote, but did find another way to do it: show that the rank of the <code>R</code>-module <code>M</code> agrees with the dimension (over <code>Frac(R)</code>) of <code>M \otimes_R Frac(R)</code>, then use what we already have for division ring. My reference to "ordinal induction" is basically this but with the fractions inlined in the division ring proof.</p>

<p>My french is terrible, but I think it says <code>A</code> is any unital commutative ring (bottom of p.1), and has the claim that in an infinite free module, every maximal independent set has the same cardinality on p.4, as Section 2.1.</p>

<p>Bottom of page 1 says: We'll assume A commutative and unital. Recall that every basis of a free module M have the same cardinal.<br>
Section 2.1 says: If M is an infinite dimensional free A-module, then all maximal independent sets have the same cardinal.<br>
