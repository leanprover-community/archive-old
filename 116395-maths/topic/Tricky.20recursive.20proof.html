<p>TL;DR: <a href="https://github.com/b-mehta/lean-experiments/blob/master/src/kruskal_katona_abstract.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/b-mehta/lean-experiments/blob/master/src/kruskal_katona_abstract.lean">An abstracted version of my problem is here</a>, I'd like to prove the theorem at the bottom and I can't seem to make any serious progress.<br>
A bit more detail on the problem: we're interested in families 𝒜 of subsets of X={1,...,n} (and each subset has size r) and we'd like to minimise a packing-like quantity: the size of its shadow. (The definitions of these things shouldn't matter for this; the types are in the link above, and the <a href="https://github.com/b-mehta/lean-experiments/blob/master/src/kruskal_katona_rewrite.lean" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/b-mehta/lean-experiments/blob/master/src/kruskal_katona_rewrite.lean">actual definitions are here</a>, if they're needed. I think I've put all the necessary lemmas in the abstracted version though.)<br>
The goal is to prove that among families of a fixed size, the minimum size of shadow is attained at a particular family (I'll call this C). To do this, we apply "compressions": applying a compression keeps the family the same size and (weakly) decreases the size of its shadow (under certain conditions), and makes the family look a little bit more like C. (Compressions are also idempotent)<br>
What are these conditions? Compressing using the (fin)sets (U,V) (where |U| = |V|) will decrease the size of the shadow of 𝒜 if 𝒜 is already compressed with respect to every pair (U₁,V₁) such that |U₁| &lt; |U| (again, |U₁|=|V₁|). <br>
Also, applying a (U,V) compression strictly decreases a particular quantity which I've called the c_measure.<br>
Putting all this together, we get the following lemma</p>

<p>(<code>gamma</code> is a relation which essentially says it's worthwhile to compress using this pair - one of the things in gamma is that |U|=|V|) (∂ is notation for the shadow).<br>
I'll state also the theorem I'd like to prove from this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">theorem</span> <span class="n">kruskal_katona_helper</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="err">𝒜</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">finset</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">finset</span> <span class="n">X</span><span class="o">))</span> <span class="o">:</span>

</pre></div>


<p>(I'll prove later that ℬ satisfying the last condition means that it is exactly C, but this will do for now.)<br>
The maths proof looks something like this. Set 𝒜_0 = 𝒜, and we'll construct a (finite) sequence 𝒜_n. If 𝒜_k is already compressed with respect to all (U,V) in gamma, stop. If not, choose (U,V) in gamma such that  𝒜_k isn't (U,V)-compressed, with |U| minimal, and set 𝒜_(k+1) to be the (U,V)-compression of 𝒜_k. This process terminates, since the c_measure is strictly decreasing (and it's always a natural number). Then set ℬ as the final element of this sequence, and we're done.</p>
<p>This doesn't seem too hard, but I'm pretty muddled on how to prove this in lean. Actually constructing the sequence seems wrong - I'd have to prove that it'll terminate and it's not clear how (I'd kinda like something like Haskell's <code>unfoldr</code>, maybe?). There's the stuff about well founded relations, but I only get stuff about the compression being better if |U| was picked carefully. It's also not immediate that if you (U,V)-compress, then (U',V')-compress then you're still (U,V)-compressed, so inducting on the size of |U| wouldn't work either. Any help appreciated</p>

<p>Unless there is some detail I'm missing. When you construct your sequence, do you need anything about the previous A_k (other than it came from A by some sequence of compressions)?</p>

<p>I've got the line <code>by_cases (∃ U V, gamma U V ∧ ¬ is_compressed U V A),</code>, and it doesn't like this because the type of the expression isn't decidable - I can use classical logic but it doesn't seem right to just assert locally that the expression I want is decidable. Instead, <code>U</code> and <code>V</code> range over a finite set, not being compressed is definitely decidable and <code>gamma</code> looks like <code>∃ (HU : U ≠ ∅), ∃ (HV : V ≠ ∅), {decidable stuff using HU and HV} as argument</code>, so this thing should be decidable... How can I show this? I've found the definition of decidable and decidable_rel, but it seems like there should be some lemmas to help me out</p>

<p>Adding that instance in (I'll PR it to mathlib soon) made it work</p>
