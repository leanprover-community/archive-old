Whatever next? 1 is prime? Can I change the definition and add that the set is non-empty? I think that this is the standard convention (I just checked in Hartshorne and he has the empty set as not irreducible).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> There is a notion of spectral spaces: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_space" target="_blank" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_space">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_space</a><br>
Usually, the empty space is considered to be spectral.<br>
Every spectral space is homeomorphic to <code>Spec(R)</code> for some commutative ring <code>R</code>.<br>
Prime ideals are by definition not allowed to be the entire ring. If we remove this condition, then <code>Spec(R)</code> will never be empty.</p>

<p>It depends on whether you want non-Lean-using mathematicians to be able to recognise the statements.</p>
<p>I think there is a difference between "maths says it's undefined, but Lean gives some rubbish definition anyways" and "maths says it is defined as <code>X</code>, but Lean says it's defined as <code>X'</code>".<br>
<code>x/0</code> is an example of the first kind. But changing the definition of irreducible or integral domain etc is an example of the 2nd kind.</p>

<p>It is very rare to see choices like this explained in the literature. They just pick something and then you the reader are wondering why it was done that way. They go to great lengths explaining the consequences but many of them apply in other versions of the definition too so you have to do some archaeology to find out why the author chose that convention.</p>

<p>I like to delay such choices until the math itself tells me the answer.

<p>I think this is a really interesting thread. I have long worried about this sort of stuff, from way before I got interested in computer formalisation. The first thing I think should be stressed is that, as both Reid and I and probably most of the other mathematicians here know, is that our conventions (trivial ring isn't a field or an ID, univ isn't a prime ideal or a maximal ideal, empty set isn't irreducible, 1 isn't a prime number, trivial group isn't simple...) are all globally coherent and part of a bigger picture which one could regard as a convention. Beyond some point it becomes manifestly clear that our conventions are correct in the sense that they isolate ideas which are central to the more advanced theory, e.g. the spectrum of a commutative ring is the prime ideals and this definition turns out to be of huge importance in mathematics; this observation alone makes it clear that one needs a word for what mathematicians currently call a prime ideal.</p>
<p>Mario is challenging the conventions, which of course is a very healthy thing to do. What I know for sure is that our chosen conventions work and make the "classification theorems" (every positive integer is uniquely the product of primes, every Noetherian topological space is uniquely a union of maximal irreducible subspaces etc) very "clean". Mario complains that classifications are hard to formalise / hard to use, or whatever, but in real life mathematics they are used everywhere; if we let 1 be a prime then we would forever be dealing with special cases, for example, even though I can see that 1 satisfies many of the basic properties of primes developed before the classification theorem (e.g. <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>âˆ£</mo><mi>a</mi><mi>b</mi><mtext>â€…â€Š</mtext><mo>âŸ¹</mo><mtext>â€…â€Š</mtext><mi>p</mi><mo>âˆ£</mo><mi>a</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p\mid ab\implies p\mid a</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">p</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">âˆ£</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.71844em;vertical-align:-0.024em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">a</span><span class="mord mathdefault">b</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">âŸ¹</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">p</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">âˆ£</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">a</span></span></span></span> or <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>âˆ£</mo><mi>b</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p\mid b</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">p</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">âˆ£</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">b</span></span></span></span> is true for <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p=1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">p</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span></span></span></span> and indeed this property classifies positive integers which are either prime or 1; and these super-basic results are the kind of things which formalisers find very important because they use them all the time when building their APIs).  To give another example, Mario points out that the fundamental results on mathlib-irreducible topological spaces go through very nicely even when the empty set is allowed, although we all know that the classification theorem will fail in the sense that it will have to deal with the empty set as a special case, just like the uniqueness of prime factorization would have to make a special case for factorizations involving 1.</p>
<p>The conclusion I want to draw is that these more primitive notions (e.g. the notion of being 1 or prime, or being mathlib-irreducible) seem to play some important role in formalisation, but ultimately the more subtle notions (the conventions which Reid and I are backing) come to the fore later on. My proposal then is simply to rename current mathlib's <code>irreducible</code> (which includes the empty set) as <code>preirreducible</code>, and then have another section of lemmas for <code>irreducible</code> which is defined to be <code>preirreducible</code> + <code>nonempty</code>.</p>

<p>To clarify, I mean to say that a classification theorem is a "heavyweight" theorem, so I tolerate a higher number of assumptions and more complex consequences in this case. This is in contrast to theorems like "a finite set is compact" where you really don't want extra side conditions in the way because they are used more frequently.</p>

<p>The definition of prime in Lean always struck me as odd, it is a conjunction of two seemingly unrelated statements. On the other hand the concept of prime is clearly the right one. I could imagine seeing up the preliminaries of the theory with preprimes</p>

<p>It is the same condition, specialized once to n = 0 and once to n = 2. It's just that we write the product of 0 things as <code>1</code> and "implies the empty disjunction" as <code>not</code>.</p>

<p>For n = 1 the condition is a tautology and for n &gt;= 3 it follows from the case n = 2 by induction, so we can omit those.</p>

<p>It's the same story for integral domains, connected spaces, irreducible spaces, connected graphs etc.</p>

<p>I only noticed this term that <code>semilattice_sup_bot</code>was precisely what you needed for all finite joins to exist: the two axioms are n=0 and n=2.</p>
