<p>Hi,<br>
I would like to prove Hahn decomposition and am I correct in saying that there is no signed measure in mathlib yet? <br>
Using the definition from wikipedia, I think a natural definition for this is to define a signed measure as a function to <code>with_top \R</code> (satisfying the axioms).  Would this be a good idea? Would theory about <code>with_top \R</code> be welcome in mathlib?</p>

<p><code>ereal</code> is the type of <code>real</code> + infty. It's already in mathlib.</p>

<p>If <code>mu</code> is a signed measure, you want <code>-mu</code> to also be a signed measure. So, if you allow plus infinity, you also need minus infinity (and indeed <code>ereal</code> contains both).</p>

<p>It depends on what you want to do. Most signed measures I have ever encountered had finite total variation, and in this case you could even take the measure to be real-valued (or more generally vector-space valued, which has the advantage of treating in particular complex-valued measures). If allowing infinity is important for you, though, then I think your definition looks good (although I am not completely sure if you shouldn't add some summability assumptions -- but you will see that when trying to formalize theorems).</p>

<p>I've now continued to work with the definition (and it seems that you were correct in that I didn't need infinity anyway) and gotten as far as proving the <a href="https://github.com/JasonKYi/probability_theory/blob/main/src/hahn.lean#L529">Hahn decomposition</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/JasonKYi/probability_theory/blob/main/src/singular.lean#L28">Jordan decomposition theorem</a>. I've now realized a problem with this definition where two signed measures are equal iff the underlying function is equal for every <code>set \a</code>. This is not what I want since I would like two signed measure to be equal if they agree on measurable sets. To fix this I added the condition that a signed measure on nonmeasurable set is 0 (see <a href="https://github.com/JasonKYi/probability_theory/blob/main/src/signed_measure.lean#L18">here</a>) and it seems to work fine. Is this a reasonable condition? Is there a better method of fixing this problem? Thanks</p>

<p>But your restriction that the measure of non-measurable sets should be zero looks perfectly fine to me. </p>
<p>Then develop everything you can for general vector-valued measure (to handle simultaneously signed measures and complex measures), and specialize to signed measures only when it's needed (no need for a new name, just use <code>vector_measure ℝ</code>).</p>

<p>Whenever you check that you have a vector measure, when checking <code>m_Union</code> even in its weak version you will need to prove the summability (because otherwise you won't be able to prove anything), so requiring summability in the definition will not make checking it harder, and it will make using it easier.</p>

<p>My advice is to require <code>has_sum</code> in the property <code>m_Union</code>, see <a href="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/signed.20measure/near/244965136">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/signed.20measure/near/244965136</a>. It requires that, for any disjoint sets <code>f i</code>, their measures are summable, and add up to the measure of their union.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110050">@Sebastien Gouezel</span> This is what I have right now: <a href="https://github.com/JasonKYi/probability_theory/blob/main/src/vector_measure.lean#L41">https://github.com/JasonKYi/probability_theory/blob/main/src/vector_measure.lean#L41</a><br>
Is there anything else you think needs changing?</p>
