<p>Currently <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/residual">docs#residual</a> defines <code>residual</code> in its docstring as "contains a dense G-delta", and officially as the <code>filter</code> generated by such sets. It notes that these don't necessarily coincide in non Baire spaces. </p>
<p>In fact, as far as I can tell <em>neither</em> of these definitions agrees with the one I am used to (and the only one I could find in a brief search), which is that the residual sets are (the elements of) the <code>countable_Inter_filter</code> generated by dense opens. </p>
<p>This definition coincides with the other two in Baire spaces, but there are nontrivial things you can say about Baire category without assuming your space is Baire, and I don't know if they work with the current mathlib definition.</p>

<p>Has anyone seen the mathlib or docstring definition anywhere? does it have a use? It doesn't seem as though mathlib ever mentions <code>residual</code> for non Baire spaces after the definition.</p>
