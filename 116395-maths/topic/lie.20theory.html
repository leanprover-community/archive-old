<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="240862">@Oliver Nash</span> I've been following your Lie PRs with curiosity, and I'm a big fan. Could you share in a couple of lines what kind of things you would like to aim for. E.g., may we dream of working towards the classification of semisimple Lie algebras?</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> I'm very grateful for the numerous very helpful improvements that you and others have provided. I do have the semi-simple classification in mind but I've been telling myself just to aim for the statement for now, rather than the proof.</p>

<p>Even the statement would be cool!</p>

<p>I hope so :)</p>

<p>I'm a differential geometer at heart though and I'd really like to define the Lie algebra structure on vector fields of a smooth manifold since IMHO until we have that, the tangent bundle is just another vector bundle but once we have that, we're really doing differential geometry.</p>

<p>(Obviously this doesn't really need any Lie theory.)</p>

<p>I actually tried this a week or two ago but I learned that there was a moderate amount of work to do even to prove that the continuous/smooth sections of the tangent bundle are an additive group, and that most of this should be done for vector bundles (not yet defined) so I backed off for the time being.</p>

<p>So for now I'll probably just keep plugging away trying to get to the statement of the classification. I looked for the trace because I was thinking I should be able to state Cartan's criterion for semisimplicity etc.</p>

<p>Unfortunately (for now) my day job takes up far more of my time than I'd like so my progress has been somewhat glacial but nevertheless, non-zero!</p>

<p>I know the feeling. It's an open source project and people contribute when they have time. Thanks a lot!</p>
