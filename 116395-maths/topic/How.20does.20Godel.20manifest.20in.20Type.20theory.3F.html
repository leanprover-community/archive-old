<p>In PA with FOL, Godel's incompleteness theorem manifests in a rather nice way -- the Godel statement, while true in the standard model of <code>ℕ</code>, is not true in some non-standard models, because it can just have a non-standard Godel number and be "provable" in these models, because non-standard numbers allow you to have a stupid definition of a "proof".</p>
<p>In SOL, you don't have non-standard models of <code>ℕ</code>, so instead you either actually have semantic truths that are syntactically unprovable, or you don't have a computable proof-checker (I have trouble wrapping my head around this too, but it's fine for now I guess).</p>
<p>How does it manifest in Type theory? Are undecidable statements like N = Z an incompleteness of the first sort (there are models in which it is true, and models in which it is false) or of the second sort (it is true/false in all models, but we can't prove it within Lean)?</p>

<p>N = Z is an undecidability of the first sort, but this is a much more boring kind of undecidability result than Godel incompleteness</p>

<p>Do you just mean that logics that don't have a completeness theorem are a "lie"?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SOL models are kind of a lie</p>

<p>Can you elaborate?</p>
<p>(I really <em>want</em> to believe this because I cannot understand SOL models at all, lol.)</p>

<p>We could have defined Z to literally be N (a type alias) and then defined a new zero, one, addition and multiplication on it. Then N=Z would be provable</p>

<p>The definition of a SOL model is hamstrung by the requirement that the second order variables must represent <em>all</em> subsets of the base type. This makes it possible to prove that SOL models are always standard, but there are models that are "as good as" SOL models but where the second order variables range over a smaller subcollection of subsets, for example those defined by a formula, and these can be nonstandard even though you can't tell them apart by a formal theory</p>

<p>In short, SOL models commit you to some kind of "infinite knowing" that seems implausible to me</p>

<p>And those models with missing subsets aren't actually models of SOL? </p>
<p>Or is that question just meaningless noise?</p>

<p>They aren't actually SOL models, because the definition excludes them, but not because they can act as models in every other respect</p>

<p>You get categorical models in the standard semantics, and a completeness theorem for Henkin semantics</p>
