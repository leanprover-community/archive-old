<p>Currently, <code>measure.map f μ</code> is defined to be <code>0</code> if <code>f</code> is not measurable (in <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/measure_theory.measure.map">docs#measure_theory.measure.map</a>). This global measurability assumption is nice as it ensures that this operation is linear on measures, from which a bunch of nice properties follow automatically. However, it is creating difficulties to me in a probability theory context: if I have two integrable random variables <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> and I want to say that they have the same distribution, the natural formulation would be to require that <code>measure.map X ℙ = measure.map Y ℙ</code>, however this fails if <code>X</code> or <code>Y</code> is not measurable (note that they are ae measurable by the integrability assumption). So I am considering refactoring <code>measure.map</code> to allow ae measurable functions, but I'd like to check here for thoughts before -- it's probably gonna be a bit of work, so if it doesn't look like a good idea I'd rather not start on it. Thoughts, anyone?</p>

<p>So you want <code>measure.map f μ</code> to be well-defined (and not 0) if <code>f</code> is <code>μ</code>-ae-measurable? That sound like a natural thing to do.</p>

<p>But indeed losing linearity means that you would have to rewrite many things ... would it make sense to have two versions?</p>

<p>Yes, in most situations. But if a theorem is true assuming only <code>integrable X</code>, it would be a shame to prove it assuming <code>measurable X</code> and <code>integrable X</code>.</p>

<p>I am not sure it will be that painful. But I won't know before I try!</p>

<p>Losing linearity should not be a big issue for probability as long as you still preserve convex combinations?</p>

<p>Whenever the function is measurable this would coincide with the previous definition, so you would keep all the nice properties.</p>

<p>I think as long as we have the same APIs for measurable functions it will work fine so I'm in favour of the refactor</p>
