<p>In <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/deuber/src/combinatorics/deuber.lean">branch#deuber/src/combinatorics/deuber.lean</a> there is now a proof of "partition regularity of (m,p,c)-sets" (which is a sort of simultaneous generalisation of vdW and Folkman's theorem, and could become part of a proof of Rado's theorem). This was a bit tricky to formalise since there are a lot of details that you seem to need to do by hand. I'll try to PR it eventually.</p>

<p>Oh very nice! Is it the same partition and regularity concepts as in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/szemeredi/combinatorics/mathlib.lean">branch#szemeredi/combinatorics/mathlib.lean</a>? If so, I would very much like to compare approaches because I'm not quite happy with how we handle density (but it's more of an esthetic concern).</p>

<p>The definitions can be read (in maths notation) from here <a href="https://dec41.user.srcf.net/h/III_L/ramsey_theory/3">https://dec41.user.srcf.net/h/III_L/ramsey_theory/3</a>, I think David used an essentially equivalent source. The concept of regularity here is different, but <code>partition</code> means the same thing as it almost always does, except that in this case (like in most of combinatorics) we partition into finitely many bits.</p>

<p>I've now had a look at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/deuber">branch#deuber</a>, and it looks very good! Lots of cleanup to do and docstrings to be written, but I believe this is the way to go.</p>
