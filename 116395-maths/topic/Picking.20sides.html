<p>Actually, the Heine PR series has nothing to do with this project. It's because of <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad_todo.html">https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad_todo.html</a>. Also it's a bit ridiculous that I asked my students to prove the Heine theorem in Lean at the end of  my exam (for function on segments of reals numbers of course) but it's not in mathlib.</p>

<p>Actually, the Heine PR series has nothing to do with this project.

<p>Wait Heine isn't in Mathlib ? Also, I'm keeping this page in a bookmark, that's another idea of things to do this summer <span aria-label="laughing" class="emoji emoji-1f606" role="img" title="laughing">:laughing:</span></p>

<p>We could have put the elementary version a long time ago. But doing the general case requires more work, and nobody has needed it up to now. The main reason why this theorem is taught very early is because it's useful in order to construct Riemann integration. mathlib jumped over this and went straight to Lebesgue (and even Bochner actually).</p>

<p>Yeah I see. In general, would it be a good idea to actually put such specializations first in the library, or do you recommend always starting by the general case ?</p>

<p>We usually start with the general case, but there are exceptions. For instance, the file defining exponential and trigonometric functions is <em>very</em> elementary.</p>

<p>Yes, but hopefully it won't stay like that forever.</p>

<p>Sure, but we started with the super elementary approach.</p>
