<p>I'm just looking at the definition we have of circulants. <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/linear_algebra/matrix/circulant.html">https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/linear_algebra/matrix/circulant.html</a></p>
<p>The definition I am more familiar with has the circulant matrix generated by cycling the rows, not - as here - the columns.</p>
<p>While it doesn't strictly matter - a row-generated circulant is also a column-generated circulant (<code>v : n → α</code> and <code>λ (i : n), v (-i))</code> respectively)- it does require a slightly tiresome amount of translation, and means that there are some lemmas that are natural and true but not present - for instance, a <code>vec_mul</code>  version of <code>matrix.circulant_mul</code>.</p>
<p>What do people think the best way to allow for both the row-form and column-form would be? And does anyone know why it was defined in terms of columns to begin with - is this standard in some other context?</p>

<p>Sorry, I actually see wikipedia does do it by column! So probably that is the answer. But one can certainly also do it via row (see page 31 in <a href="https://bikesuite.org/files/v4.2/BIKE_Spec.2021.09.29.1.pdf">https://bikesuite.org/files/v4.2/BIKE_Spec.2021.09.29.1.pdf</a>).</p>

<p>One might also want an <code>is_circulant</code> predicate, and certainly it is true that the subring of circulant matrices over a ring R indexed by fin n are isomorphic to polynomials in R[X]/(X^n - 1) (which, per my other recent question, are in turn isomorphic to vectors of the form fin n -&gt; R with the multiplication that corresponds to the convolution operation).</p>

<p>I don't ask arbitrarily - the theory of quasi-cyclic codes is intimately connected to circulant properties.</p>

<p>Hey; love the circulant work! If you have a mo I would appreciate a look at my above questions.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="330967">@Wrenna Robson</span> Yes, I don't see there is any substantial difference between the row definition and the column definition.  So I think either way is fine. <code>is_circulant</code> may be helpful if you need such a thing very often in your work, but this is also a very simple thing. More interesting things may be to write more algebraic connections (I may have already written some, but I don't remember now..) as the current file is quite basic.</p>

<p>Yes, it's purely to aid in the construction of the circulants.</p>
