<p>What do people think about defining <code>sign</code> on elements of any group acting on a finite set? It feels like a bit of a historical accident whether things about group actions became definitions about symmetric groups or definitions about group actions.</p>

<p>How much is <code>sign</code> being used currently? I would say, go for it!</p>

<p>Wouldn't that mean instead of writing simply <code>sign p</code>, you have to specify both the group element and the set being acted on somehow? And once you have both of those, you get a permutation anyways. So I'm not seeing how the change would help.</p>

<p>It would mean you'd have to write <code>sign \alpha p</code>, the main advantage is slightly shorter notation, it's not a radical change, but might be a bit nicer.</p>
