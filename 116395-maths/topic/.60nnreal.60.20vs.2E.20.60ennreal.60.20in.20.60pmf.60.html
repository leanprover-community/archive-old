<p>I've been working with <code>pmf</code> a lot recently in a project to formalize some cryptography constructions in Lean. This works well to represent the distributions associated to a computation, but as I write more complicated constructions I've been running into more and more issues involving <code>summable</code> requirements in <code>nnreal</code>. </p>
<p>I've been playing around with using <code>{ f : α → ℝ≥0∞ // has_sum f 1 }</code> as the definition of a <code>pmf</code> instead, since <code>summable</code> is automatic in <code>ennreal</code>. In particular <code>pmf.bind</code> becomes much more workable.  It also simplifies working with the <code>outer_measure</code> associated to a <code>pmf</code>, which had been somewhat complicated when I originally defined it.</p>
<p>I have a branch implementing this change, which just has a few holes left. In general it seems to shorten most of the existing proofs and definitions. Would there be any reason to avoid making this change? Otherwise I can open a PR for it when the last few changes are finished.</p>

<p>I've cleaned up my branch and opened a PR <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/17032">#17032</a> for this refactor if anyone wants to compare the changes. <code>pmf</code> isn't used anywhere else, so I didn't really need to touch anything else within actual mathlib itself.</p>

<p>I like this change. I tried using pmf for something a while back and found the constant coercion between <code>nnreal</code> and <code>ennreal</code> a bit annoying. I don't use 'pmf` that often to have a strong opinion about this however.</p>

<p>Sorry, I was asked to participate to the discussion by Johan, perhaps because this has to do with probability, but I did not comment. The reason for that is that although this pmf construction is in the probability folder, it is very much isolated and I have never used it, so I don't have much to say.<br>
But in general, about nnreal vs ennreal: if you find that you suffer less from non-math troubles like coercions or obvious summable arguments with ennreal, then go for it!</p>

<p>(Devon: I've suggested and pondered before the value of a "finprod" or "finpmf", the idea being that this is for when you have some pmf with either finite domain or finite support. I'm thinking in a similar context to you, I suspect... but I'm not sure if there's any value in it really. I do think it would be good to define entropy suitably sometime but that's a whole other question.)</p>

<p>I've actually done a lot of work on the finite support case, but it's on the level of probabilistic computation rather than the associated probability distributions. If you'd be interested I don't think it would be difficult for me to move it down a level of abstraction to pmf instead. I've found it somewhat useful, mainly because it allows the outer measure stuff to be expressed with finset.sum (similar with pmf.bind)</p>

<p>One might want to consider subdistributions instead of distributions ofc.</p>

<p>Would anyone be able to take a second pass through <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/17032">#17032</a> ? Getting this merged would help with a lot of other things downstream</p>
