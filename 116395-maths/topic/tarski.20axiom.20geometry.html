<p>I think both would be valuable! The axiom systems are both interesting, and we can keep Joseph's development as the 'intended' case while the axiomatic ones are treated as separate theories</p>

<p>Thank you! It's so happy to see people want to contribute to this project. Now it's not provable yet, but we just need one more step to prove it. I did update something on parallelism but I forget to push to github. I just pushed them now and you can have a look. Parallelism is simply defined by two lines without intersections. I am now proving corresponding angles for parallel lines are equal. It's a result by contradiction and that exterior angles are larger than the interior. With this lemma we will be ready to prove the midpoint theorem.</p>

<p>We are now ready to prove midpoint theorem. I just drafted the proof that corresponding or alternative angles are equal iff parallel. It's mostly done with some sorry which is not hard to fill. I will complete them later (but feel free to try them in as exercises too).</p>

<p>I just filled all the blanks in corresponding angles and alternative angles. For some hints, you might need the following to prove midpoint theorem:</p>
<ol>
<li>extend_congr_seg'<ol start="2">
<li>SAS</li>
<li>alternative_eq_iff_parallel</li>
<li>ASA<br>
Remind me if you finish the proof or have any questions.</li>

<p>I already proved vertical angles are congruent in congruence/baisc.lean, although without explicitly defining flipped ray.</p>

<p>Hi! I’m Kei Tsukamoto. I’d like to join the project about formalizing tarski’s axiom geometry using Lean with my friend Shun . Could anyone tell us how the project is going and what we should do now?</p>

<p>I'm not really sure there's an active project at the moment - the only formalisation of Tarski's axioms in Lean I know of is my GeoLean project, but that was designed more as a direct port of the Coq version rather than a Lean-style development</p>

<p>I have had several Imperial students doing projects formalising geometry axiomatically e.g. <a href="https://github.com/Ja1941/Hilberts-axioms">here</a>, and they all made standalone projects rather than trying to get stuff into mathlib. For me, any new formalisation should attempt to get to the "next level" which would be using widgets to generate diagrams, which would mean doing a formalisation in Lean 4.</p>

<p>I'd suggest aiming for Freek's item 12, The Independence of the Parallel Postulate, by proving a complete characterization of instances of versions of axiomatic geometry with and without the parallel postulate (showing that the instances of the former are exactly Euclidean spaces of appropriate dimension, and instances of the latter are exactly Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces of appropriate dimension) - setting things up in appropriate generality to be able to handle spaces of different dimension and to be able to handle the hyperbolic case, and aiming to get things into <code>geometry.tarski</code> in mathlib (with room for also having e.g. <code>geometry.hilbert</code> or <code>geometry.avigad</code> for other sets of axioms).</p>

<p>Your GeoLean project is impressive!<br>
But what change would make it more lean-style?</p>
