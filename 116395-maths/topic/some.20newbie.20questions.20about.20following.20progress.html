<p>Pls let me ask another newbie question. I read that proofs are usually done outside of mathlib, and only afterwards imported. Also, only if code is imported in mathlib, it is save for future updates. How about proofs huge proofs like those from the LTE or the definitions in the perfectoid spaces, are they in mathlib? Other, more elementary proofs like the Hall's marriage problem (asking as i saw the paper and talk about it by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="303889">@Alena Gusakov</span>), is that in mathlib or only available externally?</p>
<p>Is there some place where i can see all defintions/theorems that are included, and progress (i.e. when new theorems are included)? I am sure this infos is available in the docs, but there is so much data for beginners, i failed atm to understand these super basic questions. Thanks :)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="297962">@Mario Krenn</span> we make an effort to move as much as possible into mathlib. For now, LTE contains a directory called <code>for_mathlib</code>. It used to have &gt; 7000 lines of code, but in the past 2 weeks, we've got it down to 5500 lines. My hope is that around the summer break we'll have cut that number in half.</p>

<p>Our current approach is to keep the big specialized projects outside of mathlib (see <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean_projects.html">here</a>)), and some of it (IMO problems, the sensitivity conjecture) is also in the directory <code>archive/</code></p>

<p>One answer to this is the PR list on github: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pulls">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pulls</a></p>
<p>For example, this is where the proof of Hall's theorem lived for a couple months as it got polished for inclusion.  (It's even still somewhat in development, with a PR to give the non-finite version.)</p>

<p>This is slightly related to following progress. How would i see what happens to Hall's marriage Theorem? I see this page (<a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/combinatorics/hall.html">https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/combinatorics/hall.html</a>), but does it say something about when the individual generalizations have been added? Also, i am curious how complex it is to generalize further to non-bipartite graphs, i.e. Tutte's Theorem? (i am talking about the HMT because this is the entry point that interests  me most, and is probably closest related to my own work in an entirely different field of quantum physics)</p>

<p>If you click on the "source" link on the right, you'll be directed to <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/combinatorics/hall.lean">this GitHub page</a> which lets you browse the history of the file / git blame, etc. Does that help?</p>

<p>I think it might be easiest to prove Tutte's theorem from scratch because, unlike Hall's theorem, it seems to make use of graphs in an essential way.  Once <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="387244">@Yaël Dillies</span> PR's the formalization of walks and connected components for simple graphs, then it will be a bit easier to state the theorem, but even so it's not so bad:</p>
