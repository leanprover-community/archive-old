<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> is the plan to both move the <code>category_theory</code> directory, and also change the namespace?</p>

<p>Also, what's the purpose of this change exactly? Just changing the name for change's sake, so we don't have to type <code>_theory</code>? Or is there more to it?</p>

<p>My intention had been to renamed both the directory and the namespace.</p>

<p>I'm sorry if this seems pointless. :-( My intention had just been to reduce confusion between the <code>category</code> and <code>category_theory</code> directories, but it had not actually occurred to me to achieve this by merely renaming <code>category</code> to <code>control</code> and leaving <code>category_theory</code> as is. I had always thought that the name ought to be just <code>category</code> and wasn't because it already existed as something else.</p>

<p>I am perfectly happy to leave <code>category_theory</code> as it is now.</p>

<p>I don't have a strong opinion about either of these renames, but I just wanted to point out that the rename wouldn't actually fix the problem where you write, say, <code>functor.id</code> and Lean picks the wrong one.</p>

<p>Yes. That I was imagining as a still later experiment, seeing how painful it would be to put <code>functor</code> and friends into a <code>control</code> namespace.</p>

<p>I think renaming the <code>category</code> folder to something else was crucial. Everything else is optional.</p>

<p>But consistency would be nice. We have <code>ring_theory</code>, <code>field_theory</code> but <code>topology</code>, <code>algebra</code>...</p>

<p>I agree that having both <code>category_theory</code> and <code>category</code> was bad.</p>
