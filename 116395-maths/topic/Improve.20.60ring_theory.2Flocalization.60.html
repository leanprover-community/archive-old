<p>Following a suggestion of <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> (that is busy with other stuff)  in  <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="116395" href="/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Minimal.20polynomial.20over.20.E2.84.9A.20vs.20over.20.E2.84.A4">#maths &gt; Minimal polynomial over ℚ vs over ℤ</a>  I would like to improve <code>ring_theory/localization</code>. The problem is that is seems impossible (to me at least) or in any case very complicated to use results like <code>gcd_domain_eq_field_fractions</code>, where we have a monoid <code>R</code> with field of fractions <code>K</code> and an <code>K</code>-algebra <code>L</code>, in concrete situation, for example when <code>R = ℤ</code>. More precisely, I am not able to prove <code>gcd_domain_eq_field_fractions</code> in the case the GCD monoid is <code>ℤ</code> using <code>gcd_domain_eq_field_fractions</code> (of course redoing the proof in this case is easy).</p>
<p>I can do the "unskilled work", but I need some guidance. For example, Johan suggests that </p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">is_localization</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">R</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span><span class="bp">*</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">comm_ring</span> <span class="n">R</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">comm_ring</span> <span class="n">A</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">algebra</span> <span class="n">R</span> <span class="n">A</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Prop</span> <span class="o">:=</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>should be a proposition. Should it be a <code>structure</code>? A <code>class</code>?</p>
<p>If someone wants so shed some light on what is needed to do for this kind of work any advice is very welcome!</p>
