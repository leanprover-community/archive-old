<p>A few weeks ago, I wanted to experiment with the API for integrals in mathlib, and I thought the best way to do that would be to use it to prove something not trivial but reasonably easy. So here is a proof of the Gaussian integral (<code>∫ x : ℝ, real.exp (-x^2) = real.pi.sqrt</code>) : <a href="https://github.com/ADedecker/gauss/blob/master/src/main.lean#L336">https://github.com/ADedecker/gauss/blob/master/src/main.lean#L336</a><br>
As I couldn't find variable change in 2D in mathlib, I didn't make the usual proof, and I used parametric integrals instead.</p>
<p>The only <code>sorry</code> remaining will be removed once <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/6292">#6292</a> gets merged.</p>
<p>I don't know wether this should go to mathlib or not, but the <code>main.lean</code> file is definitely not PR-ready. I will do a lot of cleaning and a bit of generalizing soon, but right now I have more urgent things to do. Also, for lemmas about parametric integrals, it may be better to adapt what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> did in the Sphere Eversion project, since it should give results <em>a bit</em> more general than what I took from the undergraduate course I attended last semester <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span> </p>
<p>The <code>integral_limits.lean</code> file seems a bit closer to being PR-able, but I'm still not happy with some details of it, so feel free to have a look and give your opinions.</p>
<p>PS : Big thanks to the authors of the measure theory part of mathlib for having made an API understandable even by people like me who don't know measure theory (yet).</p>

<p>Great job! We'll certainly want this <strong>result</strong> in mathlib eventually, even if you decide not to PR your work in its current form.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="268315">@Anatole Dedecker</span> I just bumped mathlib in the sphere eversion project. I hope I'll able to PR everything I have about parametric integrals before the end of the week, but you can already copy <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/sphere-eversion/blob/master/src/parametric_integral.lean">https://github.com/leanprover-community/sphere-eversion/blob/master/src/parametric_integral.lean</a> wherever you want and play with it using mathlib master (it doesn't depend on any other sphere eversion file).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="214703">@Yury G. Kudryashov</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110050">@Sebastien Gouezel</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="111080">@Floris van Doorn</span> it would also be great if you could have a look at that file before I slice it into PRs. You can dump it into you current mathlib and have a look. Note that the most painful part is <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/sphere-eversion/blob/master/src/parametric_integral.lean#L48-L88">around interval_integral</a>, I'd love to learn what I'm meant to do there.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="262143">@Ryan Lahfa</span> the sphere eversion project would be a fabulous summer project to work on</p>

<p>A few comments:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>continuous_linear_map.continuous_apply</code>: we have a bundled <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/continuous_linear_map.apply">docs#continuous_linear_map.apply</a>;</li>
<li>I used <code>(∀ x, integrable_at_filter f (nhds x) mu)</code> instead of <code>loc_integrable</code>, see <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/measure_theory.integrable_at_filter">docs#measure_theory.integrable_at_filter</a> and <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/is_compact.integrable_on_of_nhds_within">docs#is_compact.integrable_on_of_nhds_within</a>;</li>
<li>for interval integrals you can either introduce <code>interval_oc</code> and lemmas as in your file or use something like <code>wlog hle : a ≤ b</code>. Unfortunately, it feels more painful than it should either way.</li>
