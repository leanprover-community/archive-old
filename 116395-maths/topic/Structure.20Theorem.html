<p>I want to prove the structure theorem of finitely generated modules over a PID in Lean. <br>
I'm trying to define free modules by isomorphic to direct sum <code>R^n</code>. <br>
But I don't understand why in <code>linear_algebra.direct_sum_module</code>, the indexing type  <code>iota</code> of a direct sum <code>direct_sum iota beta</code> needs to have decidable equality. In fact, I don't think I know what having "decidable equality" means, can someone explain please?</p>

<p>For <code>p : Prop</code>, <code>p</code> is decidable is supposed to mean we can prove either <code>p</code> or <code>\not p</code>.<br>
This is captured in Lean by the class <code>decidable p</code> since if<br>
one has either <code>hp : p</code> or <code>hnp : \not p</code>, then one  has an instance of <code>decidable p</code>. <br>
So <code>decidable_eq \iota</code> means equality of terms in <code>\iota</code> is decidable?</p>

<p>And the reason we care about decidable propositions is because <br>
sometimes we want to define data depending on the validity of a proposition? <br>
So for the case of index of direct sums... I'm not sure what this means <span aria-label="thinking" class="emoji emoji-1f914" role="img" title="thinking">:thinking:</span></p>

<p>In principle decidable instances could make things computable. But I don't anything about this. I simply fake decidability using <code>classical.prop_decidable</code> each time Lean complains.</p>

<p>I think that this should probably be changed in line with <code>finsupp</code>, and we should just use classical decidable equality for direct sum</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="132893">@Ken Lee</span> I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="118107">@Amelia Livingston</span> has already made a start on this, maybe you want to talk to her on Thurs or before?</p>
<p>"Decidable equality" is a computer science thing. If you switch on classical mode (i.e. mathematician mode) like Patrick says then it becomes automatic, that's why you've not heard of it. I think that if you've got an up to date mathlib you can just type <code>open_locale classical</code> and then never have to worry about this again.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> Thanks for the fix. Yes, I have already talked with Amelia about this. <br>
She said she's looking to restart and do the Smith Normal Form proof since they did it in Algebra 3. <br>
I was thinking of doing the proof via splitting the module into free and torsion, splitting torsion into p-torsion submodules, <br>
then doing structure theorem for p-torsion.</p>

<p>Ok great! The theorem will give you both the structure theorem for finite abelian groups and the Jordan canonical form which I think are the last two theorems from M2PM2 which need formalising</p>

<p>Question about the definition of dimension of a vector space: <br>
Why is it not defined as the cardinality of some basis? (It is defined as the minimal cardinality.)<br>
The dimension theorem proves these definition match anyway.<br>
In other words, is it bad if I defined rank of a free module as cardinality of just some basis?</p>

<p>Over the zero ring, the zero module has the basis {} and the basis {0}. But this is a bit of a pathological case.</p>

<p>For a non-zero ring, these definitions will all be equivalent so it doesn't matter (to me at least) which one you choose, although at some point I guess you'll have to prove that they're equivalent.</p>

<p>Since bases are indexed now, there are infinite bases for the zero module over the zero ring.</p>
