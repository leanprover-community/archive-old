<p>I see that in many parts of Mathlib (especially for more basic stuff, such as topology) lemmas having to do with the function <code>(λ x, (f x, g x))</code> are named with <code>prod_mk</code>, whereas in some newer part of mathlib they are named with simply <code>prod</code> (for example there is<code>times_cont_diff.prod</code> instead of <code>times_cont_diff.prod_mk</code>). I guess the reason for the first name was to distinguish it from <code>prod_map</code>(<code>(λ x y, (f x, g y))</code>) to avoid ambiguity. Since I am about to PR a lot of lemmas on product manifolds, I was wondering if it may be a good idea to look for uniformity in Mathlib on these names. This firstly for the sake of coherence itself, that is always a good thing and second because there are a lot of lemmas regarding smooth manifolds that have an identical counterpart in topology up to changing continuous with smooth and adding a few <code>model_with_corners</code> here and there and I want to use exactly the same names for these lemmas as in the continuous case because this way one can write a lemma of this kind in topology, copy and paste it in geometry, do just one smart replace, and that's it. Otherwise one has to look names twice and in general think of different processes for what is in the end the same exact proof. I believe <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> used the name <code>prod_mk</code> in topology and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110050">@Sebastien Gouezel</span> used the name <code>prod</code> in geometry. If you guys can decide what you like better between these two conventions, I will adapt the library myself accordingly (at least the geometry and topology sections) and name my lemmas accordingly. For what it counts I like <code>prod_mk</code> better because it completely avoids ambiguity with <code>prod_map</code> and <code>prod</code> is a good name for both, but you should decide on your own and I will just update the library</p>

<p>Coherence is definitely a good option. As to whether we should use <code>prod_mk</code> or <code>prod</code>, I don't have a strong opinion, but I think I prefer slightly <code>prod</code> as it is shorter, and not really ambiguous.</p>

<p>It was actually him who told me to ask this publicly in order to decide which of the two conventions to choose so I guess he's also open to hear if anybody has a strong opinion for some reason or if it's the same thing for everybody</p>

<p>I'm not sure it's entirely true that there is no ambiguity though; especially in theorems about the term the name will reappear smashed together with a bunch of other names and it's entirely possible for the type <code>prod</code> to appear in the same "grammatical position" as the function <code>prod_mk</code></p>

<p>When everybody will have agreed on one of these names I will change it in the topology and geometry sections and leave to other people to change it in the other parts of mathlib if they'll believe it is a good thing to adopt the same conventions of the topology section</p>

<p>Sorry, I did not understand, from <code>pair</code> &gt; <code>prod</code> &gt; <code>prod_mk</code> I'd guess that <code>pair</code> would be your first choice, but I interpret your second comment as "<code>pair</code> could be confused with set's <code>pair</code>". So is <code>pair</code> your first choice?</p>

<p>But isn't it the constructor for set pair? I thought the constructor for elements of the product of types is something like <code>prod.mk</code> or something similar (even if I always use langle rangle)</p>

<p>I agree that the specific function used to construct a pair in the <code>prod</code> type is called <code>prod.mk</code> by Lean, but that is just one implementation of putting things together so we can take them apart later. Another implementation is <code>Set.pair</code>. A third one is <code>sigma.mk</code>. Arguably, <code>and.intro</code> is another. There are also many structures with an addition operator, and I'm happy with using <code>add</code> to refer to any of them, or all of them.</p>
