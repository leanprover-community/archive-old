<p>Dear <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> , thank you for taking the time to explain the issue!  I agree that not having definitional equivalence between the usual TFAE items is not important.  I guess that my point of view is that of a beginning user of Lean who has trouble converting between the various definitions and is often stuck with the implemented one, since I am not able to "jump" to another one.</p>
<p>Maybe in a few days/weeks time, this will not be an issue for me, but one feature that I would like to have in Lean is the possibility of somehow displaying all these non-definitionally equivalent definitions and being able to choose whichever one I prefer at whichever moment I want.  I realize, as I am writing this, that likely this is already there, for the more advanced users.  I still struggle with this.</p>
<p>In the specific case of the definition of the rational numbers, for instance, I suspect that it might be hard for me to convince Lean that <code>2/2</code> is a rational number.  Especially in the case in which such a "rational number" arises as the slope of some vector bundle.  (As I have never actually played with rational numbers in Lean, I am not sure that this would really be an issue, but I hope that I have conveyed my idea, rather than the specific example!)</p>

<p>You are wrong that it is hard to convince Lean that 2/2 is a rational number, and this is an important thing to learn. [more to come]</p>

<p>The <em>definition</em> of a rational number is a coprime pair (n,d) with d&gt;0. So the "canonical" constructor of a rational number is something which is very difficult to use. However, the authors of data.rat.basic also wrote other constructors for rational numbers, including <code>rat.mk n d</code> which just takes two integers n and d and produces the rational number n/d, regardless of whether n and d are coprime etc.</p>

<p>The same is true for eliminators. The definition of <code>int</code> is "either n, or -1-n, for n a natural". This means that if you have an integer z and you want prove something about it and you know that you want to use induction, if you type <code>induction z</code> you'll get something horrible: you'll have to prove it for all integers of the form <code>of_nat n</code> and all integers of the form <code>neg_one_of_nat n</code> or whatever the constructor is called (I don't even know). I've seen students do this and it's a disaster because now you need to know the API for <code>of_nat</code> and for the other constructor whose name I've forgotten, and this is really only something which the developers of <code>int</code> need to know about. But again the developers have done their job -- you can apply <code>int.induction_on</code>, a custom induction principle designed for end users, and then all of a sudden you have to check P(0), to check P(z) implies P(z+1) for z&gt;=0, and to check P(z) implies P(z-1) for z&lt;=0. This is the induction principle which a mathematician wants. Because the definition of int/rat are "exotic", the inbuilt constructors/eliminators are bad for mathematicians. However the trick is to make better ones and encourage mathematicians to use them instead.</p>

<p>Ok, maybe I just need to get over the fact that instead of learning different, equivalent definitions of a mathematical object, I will need to learn many different names of computer functions that represent the same mathematical concept.  I still find it hard, in general, to navigate and even find/know that these equivalents exist.  For instance, I learned that the submodule spanned by a set is, in Lean, the smallest submodule containing the set (a definition that I like, by the way!).  Yet, it was then hard for me to obtain that an element in the span of a singleton was a multiple of the generator.  After I have seen how to do it, I realize that it is not difficult, but I did spend quite a bit of time trying, before I finally gave up and asked!</p>
<p>I would like to be able to feel more independent and not to have to ask questions whose answers, often, are "ooh, <code>refl</code> clearly does not work, but <code>exact id</code> does!</p>
<p>Your last sentence I think is key:</p>
<p>"However the trick is to make better ones and encourage mathematicians to use them instead."</p>
<p>I would <em>really</em> like to use the better ones, but usually I am in the situation where:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have trouble finding out what the implemented definition is;</li>
<li>I manage to find it and get stuck;</li>
<li>I have no idea where to look for an alternative definition;</li>
<li>I struggle to understand how to use this alternative definition.</li>
</ol>
<p>Normally, I hover between items 1 and 2.  I would like to at least reach 3 or 4 more reliably!</p>

<p>also, it is not uncommon for those lemmas to be marked <code>simp</code>, so one approach is to try <code>simp</code> and see if it makes progress (and if it does make progress and you want to see how, use <code>squeeze_simp</code> instead to see what lemma it applied, and then use ctrl-click to go to the lemma and look around there for other interesting things)</p>

<p>Ok, thanks for the suggestion.  I view <code>simp</code> as a huge wave that washes over everything and, if I am lucky, I can take one further step after it washes away.  Although often I undo it...</p>

<p>You can use <code>squeeze_simp</code> and then remove stuff from the list if you want.</p>

<p>Roughly speaking, all sets are "defined" by their membership predicate. So if you see <code>foo A \union bar A = univ</code> and you don't know what a <code>foo</code> is, try <code>ext x</code> to turn it into a membership question, <code>x \in foo A \union bar A &lt;-&gt;x \in univ</code>, and then there will be a ton of simp lemmas that will trigger on seeing <code>x \in &lt;some set&gt;</code> because that's how the simp lemmas are expressed</p>

<p>it will usually turn the statement into some first order logic thing that you can destructure using <code>use</code>, <code>cases</code>, <code>intro</code> and other such basic tactics</p>

<p>These are all great suggestions: thank you all!</p>
<p>I do feel like the people for whom the FAQ "have you connected your computer to the plug?" actually solves the problem...</p>
