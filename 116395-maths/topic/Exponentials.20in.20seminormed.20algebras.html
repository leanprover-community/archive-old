<p>My guess would be that it's false because my topology is too coarse; but as understand it, if I make my topology finer I would need to choose a different norm</p>

<p>I have only glanced at this briefly, but if I understand correctly, your topology is just induced by the projection onto the first coordinate (i.e., <code>R</code>). So anything which converges to <code>(r,m)</code> also converges to <code>(r,m')</code> for any <code>m' : M</code>. Therefore, this sum is not unique. Consequently, you won't be able to show the specified equality, because <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/formal_multilinear_series.sum">docs#formal_multilinear_series.sum</a> is just <code>classical.some</code> applied to <code>summable</code> (which is just an existential wrapper around <code>has_sum</code>).</p>
<p>And yes, if you need to change the topology, then you need to change the norm too. I also don't see how you have much hope of this at all if you don't have <em>some</em> topology on <code>M</code> itself.</p>

<p>Note that norms on objects like these can be a bit subtle. For example, <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/unitization">docs#unitization</a> is similar in many ways to <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/triv_sq_zero_ext">docs#triv_sq_zero_ext</a>, and the "best" norm on <code>unitization</code> (not in mathlib, but I have stuff locally for it) is kind of tricky. For example, a natural first choice would be the ℓ¹ norm (sum of the norms of the coordinates), but that norm doesn't preserve the C⋆-property when the original non-unital ring had it. Instead, the right thing to do in that situation is to take the max of (the norm of the left-regular representation of the unitization acting on the non-unital underlying algebra) and (the norm of the scalar part).</p>

<p>Do you have any actual example of a <code>triv_sq_zero_ext</code> where the topology isn't the product topology? It's a bit strange that you would want to topologize <code>tsze R M</code> without a topology on both <code>R</code> and <code>M</code>. (Note: the topology induced by the norm I described on the <code>unitization</code> above is the product topology, not definitionally, but that can be fixed with forgetful inheritance)</p>

<p>Note: it's not that the series doesn't converge to the stated value (it does, with the seminorm specified in the post), it's just that it also converges to a bunch of other random things; this is a problem for <em>us</em> because our definition of the sum uses <code>classical.some</code> to choose an arbitrary one of those, but I suspect it's not much of a problem for people working with dual numbers in practice.</p>

<ol>
<li>If you have a way of specifying <code>y</code> other than "the thing <code>f</code> converges to along some filter", then sure (because you can take this other thing to be the definition). I think in this situation that's likely exactly what happens.</li>
<li>I think here it's just convenient to motivate / explain the definition of the exponential by using the sum of the series for parallelism with more familiar exponentials.  Moreover, (a) it actually works if you use the product topology, and (b) the topology induced by the seminorm is weaker than the product topology, so the series still converges to the claimed value even though it's no longer a unique limit.</li>

<p>yes, that could be a formalization of it, but I don't think it's really that necessary. Again, I think the series formulation is primarily there for motivation and parallelism.</p>

I did end up implementing the forgetful inheritance for the <code>uniform_space</code> structure (it greatly simplifies the proof of completeness anyway; otherwise it's a bit of a pain). It's still a bit messy, but I suspect you'll be able to follow it without too much trouble.</p>
<p>One note: I realized that this norm is actually not <em>quite</em> as nice as I had remembered when the underlying algebra is not a C⋆-algebra. The reason is that it's only a seminorm unless the left regular representation of the algebra is injective (it often is, but that's a separate proof obligation). This condition is automatic for C⋆-algebras because of the C⋆-property.</p>

<p>The way that normed_space derives from topological_space means you can't implement an algebraic norm without having the associated topology forced upon you. Maybe the answer is that <code>norm</code> is not for algebraic norms.</p>

<p>No, we're trying to put a norm on <code>unitization 𝕜 A := 𝕜 × A</code>. We do this by pulling back the norm on <code>𝕜 × (A →L[𝕜] A)</code> via the map <code>((k, a) : unitization 𝕜 A) ↦ (k, algebra_map 𝕜 (A →L[𝕜] A) k + continuous_linear_map.mul 𝕜 A a)</code>. Note that <code>(0, a) ↦ (0, continuous_linear_map.mul 𝕜 A a)</code>, so, if <code>continuous_linear_map.mul 𝕜 A</code> is <em>not</em> injective, then we only end up with a seminorm on <code>unitization 𝕜 A</code>.</p>
<p>That being said, it's a bit unusual for <code>continuous_linear_map.mul 𝕜 A</code> to fail to be injective, but it is possible. For instance, take <code>A</code> to be the (non-unital) algebra of strictly upper triangular <code>2 × 2</code> matrices. Note that the product of any two elements of this algebra is <code>0</code>, so in fact <code>continuous_linear_map.mul 𝕜 A = 0</code>, and hence the induced norm on the unitization simplifies to: <code>‖(k, a)‖ = ‖k‖</code> (so this does <em>not</em> induce the product topology).</p>

<p>In case you see <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1157165/norms-on-unitization-of-nonunital-banach-algebra?rq=1">this stack exchange question</a>, just realize that several things in the question and in the accepted answer are wrong (I need to add a comment to this effect). Basically, the OP claims that the supremum gives you a norm, but this is incorrect even in the C⋆-algebra case unless the algebra is <em>actually</em> not unital (i.e., there is no identity, having one that we forgot about is not allowed). And when it's not a C⋆-algebra I showed earlier in the thread how it can even be the zero function. The answrt is incorrect because it's assuming you actually get Banach spaces from both these "norms" (for <code>‖⬝‖₁</code> this is correct), however, when that actually happens (e.g., when the norm on A is regular) then the rest of the answer is valid, and the subject of investigation in the papers above is the minimal constant <code>c</code> you can get (apparently <code>c=3</code> is optimal).</p>
