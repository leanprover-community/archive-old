<p>Is there anything about restriction of scalars in mathlib? I need to interpret a <code>ℂ</code>-vector space as an <code>ℝ</code>-vector space, but I don't want to reinvent the wheel. A quick grep did not show anything, but maybe I did not use the right keywords.</p>

<p>I was looking for precisely this last week and couldn't find anything. Looking at it now I realise that it's some kind of <code>comap</code> isn't it, a map A -&gt; B gives a map module B -&gt; module A</p>

<p>except that <code>module B</code> maybe doesn't exist in that form.</p>

<p>Yes, you have a nice categorical interpretation, as emphasized in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_of_rings" target="_blank" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_of_rings">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_of_rings</a>. What I need is the down-to-earth version, of course, i.e., a concrete real vector space structure on a given type with a concrete complex vector space structure. I'll cook up something then.</p>
