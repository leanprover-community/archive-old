<p>My plan was to define Laurent series as Hahn series with coefficients in Z and to prove that that were a localisation of power series in one variable at the variable. Thanks so much for doing this!</p>

<p>Other than the order theory, creating a new type of series with a convolution product is a bit boilerplate, except for a few small things that can go wrong in the distributivity/associativity proofs, which go wrong differently in each different context it seems...</p>

<p>While <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="302826">@Aaron Anderson</span>  was developing the more powerful theory of Hahn Series, I've amused myself defining Laurent series (in one variable), and <code>PR</code> it in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/6258">#6258</a>. There are still some <code>sorry</code>s left concerning associativity, but the basics of it being a <code>comm_ring</code> (when the coefficients are) is there. I've also defined coefficients (as a function from <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="double-struck">Z</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{Z}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68889em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">Z</span></span></span></span></span> to the base ring). Being much less experienced  then <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="302826">@Aaron Anderson</span> , my code is by far less efficient and I wonder if anything of what I've done should be kept or if the approach through Hahn series  makes everything obsolete. Before going further, I'd appreciate if anyone can have a look and tell me if it is worth spending more time on my approach, or not.</p>

<p>Personally I think it's much easier to define Laurent series as a subtype of a type of functions like how I defined Hahn series, or if you want to use ordered pairs, make the pair representation unique, like perhaps by representing it as a pair of a coefficient function with a rank, where the rank lives in <code>with_top Z</code>, with the rule that the rank is the largest possible rank such that all coefficients below that rank are 0.</p>

<p>The benefit of your sort of pair representation is in defining the embedding of power series into Laurent series, and I'll admit I haven't gotten there yet, but I think it should still not be too bad with Hahn series</p>

<p>To do that, I started expanding the API on partial well-orderings,  and in the process of looking into all of this, found that with partial well-orderings, we can drop the linearity assumption on the monomial group, which means that things like multivariable Laurent series should be possible. This is what <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7131">#7131</a> is for.</p>
