<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span> requested that we announce this a little while back, but we've been occupied with other things, so a bit delayed -- sorry Johan!</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="260507">@Heather Macbeth</span> , <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="311453">@Frédéric Dupuis</span> , and I recently wrote <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05360">a paper on the semilinear maps project</a>. We wanted to show an application of semilinear maps that were not linear or conjugate-linear. Heather suggested defining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-crystal">isocrystals</a> as a target that was in scope, given the Witt vector work. With some prodding and help from Johan and a random MathOverflow post, this turned into a proof of the dimension 1 case of the <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/isocrystal-pr/src/ring_theory/witt_vector/isocrystal.lean#L123">Dieudonné–Manin classification theorem</a>. Essentially, the 1d case reduces to finding solutions to a sequence of recursively defined polynomials: the hard part is defining those polynomials in a way that we can show they have positive degree.</p>
<p>The PR (<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/12041">#12041</a>) represents all I know about isocrystals and more. (Why do it? Because we can!) But Johan thought this was cool and I trust his taste here <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span> At some point we'll write up a blog post about this.</p>

<p>This is very nice!! I will try to review asap</p>

<p>Indeed this is nice. Now we need p-divisible groups!</p>

<p>Easier would be Hodge and Newton polygons, and Katz's theorem…</p>

<p>Surely the easiest next step would be the arbitrary dimension case of Dieudonne-Manin?</p>

<p>Shouldn't definitely be in reach</p>
