<p>But for example, in the recent lecture notes by Scholze on condensed mathematics, he needs to glue some derived categories... this doesn't actually work. So what he does instead is climb up this infty-tower, and glue some infty-categories instead. That's a thing where these infty-categories really pay off.</p>

<p>Re the connection between HoTT and (∞,1)-categories in set theoretic foundations: This is unfortunately a very sore spot for HoTT at the moment, as we don't know how to define the <em>type</em> of (∞,1)-categories. (We could do if we knew how to define the type of semi-simplicial types, but we don't.) Of course, we <em>can</em> define quasi-categories, but we then need to take the ∞-groupoid quotient by the Joyal equivalences, and we don't know how to do that. These problems all seem to require each other for their solution in HoTT, and noone knows where to start.<br>
Note that this problem with analytically defining (∞,1)-categories etc. in HoTT occurs because we aim to represent higher mathematical objects by their correct type/∞-groupoid, and we're not content with a set-presentation thereof.<br>
There is a work-around: work in HoTT as modeled in simplicial ∞-groupoids/spaces. Then we can work with (∞,1)-categories synthetically as complete Segal types, cf. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07442" target="_blank" title="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07442">Riehl-Shulman</a>.<br>
I wrote a book chapter for philosophers discussing these issues: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02177" target="_blank" title="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02177">Higher Structures in Homotopy Type Theory</a>, and the situation is basically unchanged. (Meanwhile, there were a couple of promising attempts, but so far no luck.)</p>

<p>Thanks for this, Ulrik! Something that perhaps should be stressed on this thread is that Lurie's work is not just navel-gazing -- his work on these higher categories actually has applications in what I have sarcastically referred to in the past as "proper mathematics" (although this strategy is beginning to get me into trouble so perhaps I should stop doing it). So ultimately these questions will need to be solved.</p>

<p>It's a well-written overview of a revolution that has been ripping through parts of mathematics in the last few years.<br>
It's quite clear by now that infty-cats will play a big role in future maths. Most people are sort of warming up to them. But personally, I haven't seriously used them yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice for casual readers:  99.9% of mathematicians don't even know that infinity-categories exist and, most likely, they will never care. But people who love that stuff have a very strong tendency to oversell it, most probably because it's a very heavy technology that takes longer than expected to deliver applications (to abstract mathematics, not to the real world). Personally I'd love to know more about this stuff, but I really think that kind of propaganda should not exist in mathematics.</p>

<p>We prove the conjecture that any Grothendieck (∞,1)-topos can be presented by a Quillen model category that interprets homotopy type theory with strict univalent universes. Thus, homotopy type theory can be used as a formal language for reasoning internally to (∞,1)-toposes, just as higher-order logic is used for 1-toposes.</p>
