<p>How to proceed if I want to continue the work of someone whose branch has become stale?</p>
<ol>
<li>Branch out, make commits and open a PR from my branch into <code>master</code></li>
<li>Branch out, make commits and open a PR from my branch into their branch and then open a PR into <code>master</code></li>
<li>Make commits on top of their branch (probably too unpolite)</li>

<p>In the past, what I've done is push only the commits needed to resolve conflicts to the stale branch, and then cherry picked small pieces of the branch into small PRs; in that case though, the original author was uncontactable</p>
