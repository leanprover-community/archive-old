<p>I was searching for interesting things to do in Lean, and I thought about defining the general exponential function in a Banach Algebra. How hard do you think it would be to use this definition to replace <code>complex.exp</code> and <code>real.exp</code> ? I mean, this would obviously involve refactoring big chunks of proofs, but do you think the <code>formal_multilinear_series</code> is mature enough for this definition ? If not, should I still work on the general definition, PR it, and add a "TODO : merge" somewhere, or is it better to wait and do both at once ?</p>
<p>Related question : I see that my use case (exponential of bounded linear maps) is mentionned in the docstring of <code>analysis.analytic.basic</code>. Is anyone working on that already ?</p>
