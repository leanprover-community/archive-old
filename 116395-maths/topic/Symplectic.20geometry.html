<p>Has anyone done stuff on Symplectic geometry? I'd be quite interested in working on proving things in that area, if anyone has already made a start <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>

<p>In some sense we have little more than the definition of a manifold, when it comes to geometry. My understanding is that we still can't do linear algebra with vector bundles.</p>

<p>Not necessarily worth it, but I think you could prove some symplectic-like results in the two dimensional case even now.  Assume you have an oriented 2-manifold equipped with a measure which on each chart is a smooth multiple of Lebesgue, for example.  (We don't have oriented manifolds yet but it shouldn't be too hard, define the groupoid of functions whose differentials are pointwise orientation preserving.)</p>

<p>For example, maybe it would be accessible to get Moser's theorem on the classification of compact symplectic 2-manifolds.</p>

<p>Now I think about it, Moser's theorem also works in the un-oriented case (as a result about densities rather than area (=symplectic) forms), so that would be an independent direction.</p>
