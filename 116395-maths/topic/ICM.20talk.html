<p>I finally wrote an ICM talk. It's <a href="https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/pdfs/ICMtalkv0.pdf">here</a>. The deadline to get it to the organisers is...erm (checks notes)...was... 1st October, so if anyone has comments could they get back to me by around...erm...8th December? If people want to encourage me to write some more I still have some pages spare, but I didn't want to go on for too long. I tried to give a lot of people a mention, which was probably an unwise idea but there we go. If there's anyone I forgot who did a cute thing which made it into mathlib then let me know and I'll squeeze them in somehow, I'm sure I'll have forgotten someone. I have no doubt been characteristically slap-dash with my history, I will try to get some experts to read the sections which I'm least sure about...</p>

<p>Wow nice article Kevin <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span><br>
Some comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>I feel like their is a weird emphasis on "pure" mathematics, why not just say mathematics throughout, certainly your running example of nonabelian Iwasawa theory and other examples are to show that you aren't talking about numerical analysis, and what we are doing here seems to encompass a wide spectrum of mathematical reasoning (is probability "pure" maths?)</li>
<li>Likewise I wouldn't personally say its breakthroughs in "Theoretical" computer science that have recently pushed the domain of proofs assistants forward, just computer science in general, theoretical computer science is quite a bit more mathematical than actually designing proof assistants. But maybe you have something more specific in mind?</li>
<li>formally the four colour conjecture -&gt; formerly the four colour conjecture <span aria-label="grinning" class="emoji emoji-1f600" role="img" title="grinning">:grinning:</span>?</li>
<li>The adjective loopless in the statement of the four colour theorem seems a bit redundant</li>
<li>The sentence "if one is embarking on a gigantic formalisation project, one has to decide how to internally store the data one is going to be manipulating, and this is where the computer scientists come in; they are experts in practical data management" makes it sound a lot like the choice of embedding all groups into a common parent is a choice only to manage memory somehow, rather than a way to avoid treating multiple possible group actions on the same type (Ok tbh I don't know the reasons here either, but the sentence doesn't give the right impression I think).</li>
<li>Massot developed a theory of cinompletions -&gt; Massot developed a theory of completions</li>
<li>"As Carneiro once said, you can’t stop progress" is a great ender <span aria-label="grinning" class="emoji emoji-1f600" role="img" title="grinning">:grinning:</span></li>

<p>I'm not particularly convinced by the sentence "Note that here the computer was being used to compute, rather than to prove." regarding the 4CT. </p>
<p>It's true that it wasn't building a proof inside some formal system with a verifier. But as far as I understand in order to completely believe the Appel-Haken proof, one has to treat some of their programs as if they are tactics, being run in a world with only a human verifier. Thus either the human reader has to read the programs to see that they follow the intended behaviour, or one has the treat the output as a proof script that must be read. (In practice I understand that the former is intended.) In either case, I think this is more than merely computing.</p>

<p>It's a very nice article. I wonder whether it is a good idea to emphasize propositions as types and implications as functions? It makes it sound like there is something weird and dubious going on. You can equally well present it as nothing more than notation: function types and implications are written with the same arrows, and the same notation is used to apply a lemma to arguments, apply a lemma to hypotheses, and apply a function to arguments.</p>

<p>P.S. Regarding history, according to these notes (<a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/Papers/pntnotes.pdf">https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/Papers/pntnotes.pdf</a>) the PNT formalization was completed on September 6, 2004. IIRC, Georges announced the verification of the four-color theorem a month or two after that, and Tom finished the Jordan curve theorem in early 2005. It was interesting that the three were clustered so closely together.</p>

<p>When you state Mario's result about equivalence of the logical foundation, perhaps better to say "ZFC plus countably many inaccessible cardinals" rather than "ZFC plus countably many universes", which is mixing up languages.</p>

<p>The example in Section 3.5 makes me sad. Before you actually get to the proof you have to have this digression about division on natural numbers, and even the theorem statement is artificially awkward because of the coercion. This would be much more pleasant if you started with just the statement in <code>nat</code>, and only once you embark on the proof do you push things into <code>rat</code>. Even if this comes at the expense of an extra proof obligation that the division is the same, it seems better than to have your main example mainly about how horrible working with division of natural numbers is. :-(</p>

<p>If you want to stick with this example, then at least when you write "Thus we coerce", I think you could be clearer about what is going on. Maybe instead say explicitly: "Really, we'd like to just state this theorem about natural numbers, and even though division on the natural numbers is badly behaved, in this case it is actually fine. Nevertheless, in order to have to avoid even thinking about division in the natural numbers, we intentionally state a slightly different version of the result, in the rationals."</p>
<p>That is, if you're going to include an example that involves this issue, I think you should be explicitly sad about it, and be explicit that you are doing something artificial to avoid pain. Otherwise it is just confusing.</p>

<p>From page 8: "Furthermore, we learn that the kinds of things which humans do when communicating with each other, such as identifying (G/H)/(K/H) with G/K when H ⊆ K are two normal subgroups of G (despite the fact that these groups are not actually equal from a foundational perspective), are no longer a problem."</p>

<p>• About the Mochizuki bit: "the proof must be clear on paper before it is possible to formalise in a theorem prover"<br>
I don't think that's the issue. We figured out the proof of 9.4 along the way in LTE. It wasn't clear to me at all, before we started working on the formalisation.</p>
<p>I think the issue is that if you get stuck while formalising 3.12, then what? Is Lean stupid? Is the person formalising the proof stupid? Or is there a non-proof. The Mochizuki clan will simply say "you're stupid, and you should try harder".</p>

<p>• "Once these systems become easier for mathematicians to use, students can experiment for themselves with well-chosen examples supplied by a lecturer and begin to understand what is going on."</p>
<p>Isn't this already possible right now? I think that for these "learn how proofs works" type of applications, Lean should be more than ready to handle it.</p>

<p>In 4.1, you talk about taking a proof and drilling down to the axioms. Although it might not be your cup of tea, I think the metamath web pages deserve a mention here because they are very good for this kind of thing. For a mathematician working at a high level they can feel long and verbose, but for someone who knows very little of the mathematics having a uniform way to display everything, even the advanced stuff, is great for being able to understand how everything holds together. Mathematicians know how to explain the forest, but metamath can explain the trees.</p>

<p>Thanks Kevin! I hope this will contribute to bring more mathematicians here. I think it would be nice to include some more citations to other proof assistants and maybe a couple of sample code. A rather cheap way to do this would be to replace all Lean code from Section 3.5 with Coq code (Section 3.2 would also be a natural candidate but unfortunately the recursor story is not exactly the same in Coq). You could also add citations at least to some foundational Coq paper (for instance when you write "Calculus of inductive constructions") and maybe also some Sledgehammer paper when you write "hammer". On Page 13, you need to remove my name in the "theory of manifolds" sentence, and add Sébastien's name in the calculus sentence. Also the exotic integrals take values in Banach spaces, not general topological vector spaces. I'll have some more minor remarks but I don't have time right now. I think the remarks above are the most important ones.</p>

<p>Maybe I should have written that the most urgent thing I think you should do after adding a bit more Coq and Isabelle is to send this to Assia Mahboubi and maybe Manuel Eberl and very politely ask them to help you removing as much factual inaccuracies as possible.</p>

<p>In the section about types, I feel like it could be worth mentioning that you cannot <em>prove</em> <code>a : X</code>, so this is not just another notation for <code>a ∈ X</code> (but maybe this is not relevant).</p>

<p>In section 1.4 you mention that modern proof assistants have no issues with classical reasoning, and give Lean and Coq as examples. I would add the HOL family here, since their logic is explicitly classical in setup. (Potentially we could leave out Lean since its support for classical reasoning is essentially the same as Coq's, just that the communities have different tastes.)</p>

These are our dirty secrets, but the statement as it's written it's not accurate, right ?

<p>Last sentence of Section 1.1: Many mathematicians imagine that formalisation of mathematics is exactly the kind of fiddly gritty chore that you describe at the start of this section — which is exactly why they haven't tried doing it!  Perhaps better to say something like "Tactics allow formalised mathematics to more closely resemble ordinary mathematical practice by making "obvious" things automatic."</p>

<p>Nice writeup, Kevin. A few thoughts (I may be repeating what people already said, sorry):</p>
<ul>
<li>The bit about "replacing one computer proof with another" about the 4ct proof read kind of funny to me. If someone  just learned what "formalization" means a section before, I don't think it helps to insist "no, you're missing the point, this one was formalized" without elaboration. It's maybe a point to insert something about small kernel, shifting the burden of trust from one ad hoc program to a small generic checkable thing, etc.</li>
<li>Mario could say more but I'm not sure the Metamath-Lean comparison is quite fair. As I understand it, there are "assistant"/tactic-like tools for producing MM proofs, right? The crazy strings of symbols are (sometimes) closer to proof terms than input-level tactic proofs? Lean proofs "need to be written from first principles" in the same sense that MM proofs do, if the translation happens at the foundational level and not the input level.</li>
<li>This was pointed out but the "constructive axioms built in" bit isn't fair. If you really have to compare Lean and Coq on this axis, the difference is in how the standard libraries for each make use of nonconstructive axioms.</li>
<li>Not to beg for citations, but since you explicitly call out <code>norm_cast</code>, there is a paper :) <a href="https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cade/LewisM20.html?view=bibtex">https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cade/LewisM20.html?view=bibtex</a></li>
<li>The reading of <code>eq.rec</code> is weird, I don't really follow.</li>
<li>You might want to use link shorteners for some of the web editor links. This way you could even keep them up to date if the code breaks with mathlib changes. </li>
<li>I was surprised not to see a link to Patrick's document experimentation/sphere eversion after you described it.</li>
</ul>

<p>"Humans were well aware even back in the 1960s that the proof was correct" <br>
I think this quite seriously underplays the problem of error and trust in published mathematics.  I appreciate that perhaps you want to emphasise that the value of systems like Lean is not just checking the correctness of proofs (since this might be regarded as a small payoff for a lot of effort).  But still, verifying correctness is an important contribution and shouldn't be too heavily downplayed.  It's worth noting that the entire field of Homotopy Type Theory was, in part, motivated by not one but <em>two</em> separate erroneous proofs published by Voevodsky (who nevertheless was also awarded the Fields Medal).

<p>For the purposes of pure maths research, I'm actually much more excited about the potential for "multi-level" proofs that formalisation brings. It's essential that on paper we give human level explanations, and give readers who don't want or need the gory detail a way to grok the big ideas. But too often people write explanations that are unnecessarily painful to expand into the careful detail when you want them. If we ever start writing proper literate proofs in Lean, we can solve this problem.</p>

<p>Oh, absolutely, these other advantages should be emphasised.  I'd love to see literate collapsible proofs that allow the reader to say "hold on, explain <em>this</em> step in more detail for me".  I'm just noting that verified correctness shouldn't be tossed away as if it was an unimportant side-effect of formalisation, given that there are genuine examples of substantial errors in published papers by well established authors.</p>

<p>I haven't read through this thread yet; I will do so tomorrow. But I noticed Stuart's message pop up and indeed Scott is right: mathematicians get nothing but irked if you tell them that their system doesn't work and so instead I'm telling them what they want to hear. The point is that the system is 99.9% fail-safe and that has been enough for thousands of years. We don't need to get to 99.999% especially if it's a lot of work to get there. We want to hear other reasons to formalise. Computer scientists often come across as paranoid in this regard. Perhaps Voevodsky was also paranoid -- or perhaps he was careless. If you talk to people other than Voevodsky they seem to be well aware that his erroneous paper had an error in, many years before he accepted the idea. The system was working but Voevodsky gives a skewed impression in his talks.</p>

<p>Very nice paper, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> , congratulations! As minor comments, I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do you prefer the expression "nonabelian Iwasawa theory" to "noncommutative Iwasawa theory"?</li>
<li>On p. 11, after quoting Clausen-Scholze's, theorem 9.4 you have an extra parenthesis )</li>
<li>This is very personal, but on page 9 you say that computer scientists are expert in "practical data management" or something is "pratical from the point of view of the computer prover" and I feel that the sentence is a bit harsh to computer scientists.</li>
<li>I find Gouëzel's story of passing from Isabelle to Lean to formalise Gromov-Hausdorff inspiring, and a big result which might be missing from 1.8 (or section 2)</li>
<li>You mention in a footnote that the de Bruijn factor for the perfectoid space is well over 5: is it really so? You say it comprises 16000 lines, and I wonder if 3000 lines is not a reasonable estimate for all that is really needed to define a perfectoid space.</li>
<li>In 3.3 you sometimes write proposition and sometimes Proposition (with capital P): is that intended to hint at the existence of <code>Prop</code>?</li>
<li>In 3.6 why don't you write Zermelo--Frankel with a n-dash (you write, for instance,  Hales–Ferguson)</li>
<li>In the title of our paper with Anne, Sander and Ashvni, Dedekind should replace dedekind.</li>

<p>I suppose it is something of a rhetorical flourish (a benign equivocation?), where the "data" in the first half of the sentence is not necessarily the same as the "data" that we typically associate with computer scientists. But in my opinion, the sentence totally makes sense, is memorable, and if anything is flattering to computer scientists.</p>

<p>I think the paper does an excellent job of answering the titular questions. A couple of comments/suggestions: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are interested by reading the paper and want to explore further, where do you go? Just reading the intro and then references, it is hard to figure out where to learn more about Lean or another ITP.  A footnote at </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>once you know the language</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Saying something like: <br>
<code>If you want to learn the Lean language a good place to start is \href{https://leanprover-community.github.io/index.html}{https://leanprover-community.github.io/index.html}</code><br>
  would catch the majority of people. Leaving in the url would make sure people know where to go in the case that the pdf is stripped of hyperlinks via some reprocessing back into pdf or to paper. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interested but overextended mathematician? Find a CS inclined student. Teach them math and have them learn and then teach you Lean by formalizing some of that math. Beats having them read a paper and then write a paper showing they understood the original paper.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Mario could say more but I'm not sure the Metamath-Lean comparison is quite fair. As I understand it, there are "assistant"/tactic-like tools for producing MM proofs, right? The crazy strings of symbols are (sometimes) closer to proof terms than input-level tactic proofs? Lean proofs "need to be written from first principles" in the same sense that MM proofs do, if the translation happens at the foundational level and not the input level.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, this is a bit inaccurate and I thought about saying something. While I started to write more tacticky things toward the end, for the vast majority of my time writing metamath proofs the level of automation was essentially equivalent to <code>refine</code> + <code>show</code> + <code>library_search</code>. This is very far from nothing; in particular unification is absolutely essential for being able to produce those something like those line-by-line proofs without a huge amount of copy-paste. The main tactics that I use often in lean that would have been significantly more painful in metamath are <code>simp</code>, <code>norm_num</code>, <code>ring</code>, <code>linarith</code> (and I actually ended up writing <code>norm_num</code> for metamath).</p>

So they don't see a theoretical difference, just a lot of pedantry.

<p>Here is the full review I promised. I understand that this is still your paper and your style, so feel free to ignore anything you don't like in the little liste below.</p>
<p>The paper is full of http links which are completely useless on paper. I think you can turn them in regular \cite with links in the bibliography. When read on a computer this means only one extra click. Also there are links to Lean web editors that I didn't check. Did you make sure they link to a frozen Lean web editor with frozen mathlib so that you won't have to maintain them? Ask for help to setup this if needed.</p>
<p>Page 1</p>
<p>In the abstract and many other places, including the third paragraph of the introduction, I would add "and communicate mathematics" to "prove theorems".</p>
<p>I wouldn't start in the first paragraph with such a controversial statement as "Mathematics is a game with precise rules". Generally I don't think we need to claim anything about the nature of mathematics. It's enough to discuss the way we communicate mathematics.</p>
<p>Page 2</p>
<p>"The technology to make such tools is already available" (this comes back several times). I think this is an exageration. I understand what you mean, but many people make a living of trying to bring us this technology and wouldn't be happy to read this. Maybe you could soften it to: "The technology to make such tools is already coming".</p>
<p>Paragraph 3, the first time you mention Lean you can already mention Coq and Isabelle, maybe after "If you can get...". Then I don't know whether "database people" is a good terminology. I understand you need to be vague here, but there is a risk people think about SQL. Maybe "data scientists" would be better? That's the vague word we use all the time in France. It would allow to also fix the issue that you start mentioning AI only a couple of sentences later while we know it is needed even for a searchable database. We don't want exact match for statements, there are too many variations in ways to express any given definition and result.</p>
<p>In the last sentence of that paragraph, I would again soften a bit your "formalisation is mathematics re-interpreted as a computer puzzle game", maybe including "can be seen as". But I understand this kind of sentence is very much part of your style and its efficiency so feel free to ignore such suggestions.</p>
<p>As I already told you, I think you can expand on the digitised music analogy. Deezer and similar stuff didn't not only reduce storage requirements. I'm not using these things for young people, but my understanding is they fundamentally changed the way modern artist communicate with their fans, essentially bypassing the traditional editorial and advertisement process. I hope that formalized mathematics will also fundamentally improve communication and <em>accessibility</em> of maths. Johan also mentioned that new animated movies do things that were completely impossible in the hand-drawn era.</p>
<p>Page 3</p>
<p>The discussion of tactics is a bit weird. It sounds like tactics are much more recent that they are. This comes back on Page 5 in "In the final 15 years...". I think you should check this. Maybe also cite a SSReflect paper and a Isar paper (Isar is the new style of Isabelle proof script that Isabelle people like so much). <br>
And that third paragraph misses an extremely important point: one key new ingredient is the growth of the community of mathematicians using a proof assistant.</p>
<p>Second to last paragraph is a good place for the canonical Lean citation (from CADE 25 in 2015), and also for the mathlib paper. </p>
<p>Page 5, in the paragraph before Section 1.2, are you sure the ring tactic is called the same in Isabelle/HOL? </p>
<p>Page 6, in the description of the 4 colours formalisation, is there actually any topology involved? You may be right but this is suprising to me.</p>
<p>Page 7, do you really want to keep that "odd" word, even with quotation marks? Why not adding half a sentence here and be less controversial?</p>
<p>Page 8, Section 1.4 it would be nice to \cite the formalisation paper from the beginning. At the end of the first paragraph, I think you're missing and important point. A lot of time in the odd order project was spent developping SSReflect (which began with the four colours proof).  And also figuring out how to handle such large scale projects.</p>
<p>Page 9, end of second paragraph, I already wrote this but let me repeat that LEM is not more builtin Lean than in Coq. The difference is the library (and people, but that's roughly the same thing).</p>
<p>Page 10, about Hales original paper. I think even the Annals published a disclaimer about this proof. But you should check.</p>
<p>Page 11, first sentence of Section 1.7 reads weird. Surely analytic geometry have been using homological algebra at least since Cartan. I know what you mean of course, but some readers will be puzzled. At the end of this paragraph, the parenthetical remark seems to have some grammatical issues. In the last paragraph, I'd like to mention I also contributed non-trivial proofs to that project, I don't understand why you want the team to be made only of algebraic number theorists and arithmetic  geometers.</p>
<p>Page 12</p>
<p>Section 1.8, I would add the Poincaré-Bendixon formalisation, noting the usual proof very much relies on drawings. Maybe also Assia's work on numerical integrals and Manuel's word on analytic number theory. Also note that Isabelle formalized manifolds.</p>
<p>In the next paragraph, note we are not formalizing Smale's proof. We are formalizing a much more general theorem that has Smale's result as a corollary. The last sentence about schemes reads weird since you explained earlier schemes we done very early.</p>
<p>First paragraph of section 2, don't forget to mention mathlib is monolithic and consistent (in the sense you can mix all parts). Otherwise its size is not so impressive.</p>
<p>Page 13</p>
<p>About Galois theory, isn't there a paper you can cite? Also mention somewhere the Coq formalisation. When mentioning manifolds, remove my name. Add Sébastien's name for calculus and maybe write that calculus include implicit function theorem and Picard-Lindelöf. About cateogry theory I would add Adam's name. When describing my work, you may add "adic topology, valuation theory".<br>
Why is there no name for "over time flat and projective..."?<br>
Integrals is for function taking values in Banach spaces, not topological vector spaces.<br>
I would remove footnote 7 and the "pull request" terminology and write "Contributions are reviewed...". Pull request is a very specific GitHub term.</p>
<p>Page 14</p>
<p>Section 3, I feel this lacks a general explanation of why set theory is not a good foundation (or at least not a good user interface). Maybe cite Stacks tag 0009 somewhere around here. Second paragraph of Section 3.1: you can't claim notation is the only difference between set theory and type theory...</p>
<p>Page 15</p>
<p>"In ZFC set theory, the existence..." is this litteraly true?</p>
<p>Page 16</p>
<p>Are you aware that this story is one of the differences between Lean and Coq? In Coq inductive types give rise to a fixpoint operation, not a recursor. You should probably check with Mario.</p>
<p>Section 3.3: is the first paragraph the begining of an explanation that was abandonned?</p>
<p>Page 17</p>
<p>Right before Section 3.5, the jump from dependant type as a way to handle <code>∀ x, P x</code> to sheaves is really weird and probably very hard to understand.</p>
<p>At the end of this page, I would mention that the convention for ℕ is the one used in civilized countries. And I don't think that calling <code>finset.range</code> like this is a "computer science convention". </p>
<p>Page 18</p>
<p>As other wrote, I think confronting nat division and coercions is not a good choice.</p>
<p>Page 19</p>
<p>I really think that you mention Fields medals and Annals of maths way too many times in this essay. It really sounds like formalized maths is for people who like prizes and h-factors. </p>
<p>Section 3.6 feels weirdly positionned. Also, does it miss a paragraph where you wanted to mention universes in Lean? It feels like this section ends too soon.</p>
<p>Page 20</p>
<p>plasTeX has no leading P.</p>
<p>Page 21</p>
<p>I think you should cite a sledgehammer paper when mentioning hammers.</p>
<p>Section 4.3</p>
<p>You can't seriously keep that first sentence when there are so many videos of Youtube showing you explaining maths is full of errors and this is a problem.</p>
<p>At the very end of paper, I would soften the sentence saying the proof must be clear on paper before formalisation. LTE wasn't clear to Johan when he started.</p>
<p>Page 22</p>
<p>I would soften the last sentence before Section 4.4 a lot if you want to keep good relations with Peter.</p>
<p>In Section 4.4, I wouldn't mind seeing Orsay being mentioned here.</p>

<p>Page 15: "In ZFC set theory, the existence..." is this literally true?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For reference:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In ZFC set theory, the existence of the set of natural numbers is postulated as an axiom, namely the axiom of infinity. In type theory systems such as Lean’s, the so-called calculus of inductive constructions can be made to construct types. This means that one can define types “inductively”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it is literally true, but in some ways presents a false distinction. In ZFC, the axiom of infinity is more or less the statement that the natural numbers exist. But it is important to note that you don't need an "axiom of reals" to prove that the real numbers exist, or the first uncountable ordinal, or other much larger sets. Which is to say, the axiom of infinity is <em>all</em> you need to get basically all the power of inductive types.</p>
<p>I think it is somewhat of a marketing gimmick to say that CIC has "inductive constructions", because inductive types aren't constructed at all: ZFC axiomatizes the existence of the natural numbers but CIC axiomatizes the existence of the natural numbers, the integers, the reals and tons of other things, and this is considered a good thing in type theory circles because being closer to the axioms means that you can hide implementation details.</p>

<p>It is somewhat folklore that the two approaches (recursors vs fixpoint operations) are equivalent, but they present very differently, and so they encourage different ways to "bend the rules", leading to some foundational differences between Coq and Lean. As I mention in my thesis, doing something analogous to what I did for Lean in Coq is still an open problem, because the rules aren't an exact match. If you scale back a bit, though, I think there is definitely a subset of Coq that is bi-interpretable with Lean. I believe "<a href="https://coq.discourse.group/t/alpha-announcement-coq-is-a-lean-typechecker/581">Coq is a Lean typechecker</a>" is a partial attempt at this (they had to fudge a lot of rules to make it work).</p>

<p>Within the next 12 hours I hope to have dealt with all these comments, but let me just flag a couple of issues. </p>
<p>1) People are saying "LEM is no more built in to Lean as it is to Coq". I don't understand this. LEM and the other classical axioms are <em>explicitly present</em> in core Lean. As far as I know this is not true in Coq. For me this is a big difference. I removed the comment anyway because if there is a difference of opinion then probably it should go.</p>
<p>2) The objection about natural division I simply do not buy, although I have removed the example anyway because of Scott's objection. When a mathematician has n : nat and writes n(n-1)/2, I absolutely claim that they <em>mean</em> <code>n*(n-1)/2 : rat</code>, because subtraction and division to a mathematican <em>mean</em> subtraction and division in a field. So I regard the coercion to rat as being a <em>literal translation</em> of what a mathematician is saying and I regard <code>n*(n-1)/2 : nat</code> as being mathematically meaningless, even though coincidentally (and it is only coincidentally) it gives the same answer in this case.</p>

<p>I feel like when mathematics students say <code>n*(n-1)/2</code>, they carry around a lot of implicit arguments in their head; I think their version of the ℕ division operator is "if (↑a/↑b) is a natural then that else throw a what the hell are you doing error".  I think the closest Lean gets to this is something like <code>division_by_monic</code>, which is zero if q isn't monic. For a more extreme example take the product formula of the totient function; but in that case, I feel like it's more used "formally" to get back to an expression in terms of <code>+</code>/<code>*</code> as soon as possible. Maybe this changes higher up in academia, though.</p>

<p>I think the main difference between classicality of Coq and Lean is the attitude if its users, not the system or the availability of classical axioms.<br>
<em>Many</em> Coq users try to avoid choice (and many other axioms like function extensionality) as much as they can, and often in papers of Coq formalizations there is a section on what parts do and do not use axioms (and the reason that axioms were necessary).</p>
<p>Though other libraries freely use choice throughout (e.g. math-comp analysis: <a href="https://github.com/math-comp/analysis/blob/27f0473aa958606ae2b954a1328a8e85c9fda5d5/theories/boolp.v#L25">https://github.com/math-comp/analysis/blob/27f0473aa958606ae2b954a1328a8e85c9fda5d5/theories/boolp.v#L25</a> )</p>

<p>My experience with divisions aligns with Kevin's. You write something like <code>n*(n-1)/2</code> (or something more complicated) and then at the bottom of the page you write "notice that <code>n*(n-1)/2</code> is always integral"; the integralness is not considered a precondition for writing <code>n*(n-1)/2</code></p>

<p>er, now I'm confused. When you say <code>n*(n-1)/2</code> in a summation limit or otherwise some position which requires it to be a natural number, that's a precondition on the expression to make sense. If you don't, then it's just a real number</p>

<p>In this case, I think Kevin was closer to the truth in saying that LEM is more built in to Lean than Coq. Yes, it's in the standard library, but it's not <em>that</em> standard, and people often just use something else, so when working in a Coq development it may or may not be available</p>

<p>I am probably being very naïf here, but I would say that when a mathematician has <code>n : nat</code>and writes <code>n(n-1)/2</code> they don't mean much: only once the question is asked they mean something (and then, I agree with you that they mean it is in <code>rat</code>). It is one of the wonderful (although pride-killing) benefit of working with Lean, that mathematicians got the question asked. I know that it sounds trivial, but putting this under the rug, on my opinion, is neglecting that Math is done by human beings and that changing the way humans interact with it is also part of making Math lands in the 21st century.</p>

<p>It has to be a natural number because it is a sum of natural numbers, but it's by coincidence that Lean's interpretation of <code>n*(n-1)/2</code> is the <em>correct</em> natural number.

<p>Ignoring any debate about the technical meaning of "built in": there's a history of lots of people saying "Lean is better than Coq for classical reasoning," either erroneously or without real justification. It's not true that the Lean system is better at classical reasoning because choice is imported by default, where in Coq you need to add one import line. This is an immaterial difference. I know you didn't write that line as a value judgment but it will definitely be read as stoking the flames of this argument.</p>

<p>That is, something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>no one case whether a Lean <code>Prop</code>(coq <code>SProp</code>) is proved classically, because you can't extract data from it anyway; <code>lemma</code>s are never noncomputable</li>
<li>coq has a culture / history of using <code>Prop</code>, which isn't proof irrelevant, and so noncomputability <em>is</em> meaningful on lemmas</li>

If there are people who feel that they merit a mention (because they formalised something mathsy which the audience will recognise as interesting or relevant) and who I didn't mention yet then feel free to DM me or flag the issue somehow.</p>

Nope nope nope they didn't. We didn't either. Szemerédi's regularity lemma is far easier than Szemerédi's theorem.</p>

<p>I have always been fascinated and confused about type-valued v prop-valued recursors.

<p>I was surprised by the somewhat frequent use of the word "shock", in particular twice on page 7. But maybe I'm just not easily shocked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Naively, it looks like in this case we are replacing one “proof by computer” with another one, however this is missing the point. ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I second the view you are expressing in this paragraph, and I think the argument can be strengthened a bit. Anyone who spends just a bit of time with theorem provers will quickly notice that in order to formalize something, one already needs to have a correct proof in mind, and be able to fill in all necessary details if required. Even if the prover has a bug that compromises soundness, the existence of that bug doesn't actually change anything about the process of formalization. Or, in other words, to get a wrong proof accepted, you'd have a start with a wrong proof in the first place, one that's wrong in exactly the right way. ;-) And how would that even happen, except deliberately?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the odd order formalisation, the de Bruijn factor (ratio of lines of computer code to lines of human text) was around 5. Here one could argue that it is 16000.</p>

<p>How could one argue that? (I guess it may be meant as a joke, but I don't really understand the joke then.)</p>
<p>In the section about the difference between set theory and type theory, I have a feeling that one particular aspect could be misinterpreted by people not used to type theory.

I'm not sure how to avoid this, other than maybe to state explicitly that this would be exactly the wrong way of thinking about types.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>"has to reimplement ring theory from scratch" maybe?</p>
<p>FWIW, I'd like to suggest an additional item for "4. The Future". Formalization can motivate mathematical laypersons (like me...) to dabble in research-level mathematics. There are potentially two aspects to this. The first is that formalization helps test one's intuition; this is related to what you wrote about teaching. But in the future, I can also imagine laypersons (or also just mathematicians from a different field) formalizing their work in order to convince people of its correctness.<br>
(This also works in reverse. "Oh, you think you have a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis? Very nice, please formalize it and get back to me.")</p>

<p>Many thanks! </p>
<p>I think it's dangerous to start suggesting "you have to formalise it before we believe it" will ever be a thing -- this is not how our culture works and I suspect it will never be how it works. I even explicitly suggest in the article that telling Mochizuki to formalise his proof is an unreasonable thing to do, even though part of me thinks it's a really good idea. David Roberts has convinced me in various blog posts and conversations that were Mochizuki to try and write down carefully in Lean some of the things he's talking about he might himself learn something about how to express his ideas more clearly.</p>

<p>I think that it depends very much on the <code>f</code> in question. My interpretation of this sentence was that for rather innocent <code>f</code>, it might still be painful to verify the claim.</p>

<p>I found this statement somewhat surprising - is there something making it impossible besides that it'd be a lot of work? (Maybe I read more in the word "feasible" than was meant.)</p>

<p>It's not feasible in the following sense. Consider the collection of people who have the knowledge in algebraic geometry to do the job, and the lean skills. That's a group of around 20 people all of whom hang around on this Zulip. Now consider the amount of work it would be. Now where are those people going to find the time to do that work? Right now there is no infrastructure in place for paying us to do it and no compensation eg promotions or job offers at the end of it. Thus I'm arguing that in practice right now this is not a feasible proposal</p>

<p>I found this very approachable to read. The only minor comment I had whilst reading it (beyond some typos that it looks like were pointed out above) was that I found the sentence "Gouëzel observes that the HOL systems [etc.]" a bit out of place -- the rest of the section doesn't do much comparison with other theorem provers I believe.</p>

<p>I enjoyed reading it - I always thought that an open library/database of known theorems is needed, but didn't know that it was planned and being worked on now. A typo:  'matheamtics' in page 23</p>

<p>Formalising all the proofs in the [Stacks] database is not a feasible idea.</p>

<p>I found this statement somewhat surprising - is there something making it impossible besides that it'd be a lot of work? (Maybe I read more in the word "feasible" than was meant.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure whether you mean this in the "I'll eat my hat if" sense, but this does seem like one of the predictions of the paper that is least likely to age well. I can believe in a possible future where the Stacks project is mostly formalized within 5 years. Lots of things (in particular priorities) would have to change to make that possible, but nothing inconceivable from the present moment.</p>

<p>One point that might be worth emphasizing here is that for projects such as "formalize the stacks project" to be remotely feasible, the incentive structure in academic math would have to change drastically.</p>

<p>Yes this is part of the reason why it's not feasible. Young people like Adam and Johan are right now taking risks, working on projects which will produce results which are alien to the traditional assessment approach when it comes to things like hiring or promotion or tenure.</p>

<p>Right now we have Hoskinson but I think his centre might be more focused on outreach, teaching tools, interactive stuff etc. We have to work on other sources of funding to level up. I can make the definition of a scheme in my spare time on Thursday evenings with a few undergraduates who have nothing to lose and everything to gain from the project. I can't make the stacks project in that way.</p>

<p>That it took 6 years for Odd Order Theorem formalisation is more to do with the authors being very far from the group theory, research-wise. I gather 50-75% of the time was spent learning enough group theory.</p>

<p>I think closer to the truth world be the assertion that a lot of the time was spent on formalising the prerequisites. But my point is that I think it's easier for a human to learn undergraduate level group theory, number theory and representation theory than it is to learn PhD level material about algebraic stacks and other technical things in alg geom.</p>
<p>If you like it's the same kind of problem which I'm now facing at Xena. In the past I could tell people "choose anything you like, it's probably not in mathlib" and I'd have undergraduates making PRs defining matrices. Nowadays you have to be far more mathematically advanced to contribute. It's that phenomenon but much worse when it comes to a 7000 page document summarising amongst other things post-Grothendieck breakthroughs in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry</p>

<p>I am not sure about "ease to contibute" - I still easily find undergrad combinatorics topics not in mathlib which potentially should lead to contributions. </p>
<p>But it's the grown requirements for PRs to fit well that stop the contributions, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/7498">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/7498</a> is stalled for such a reason since summer. Or problems that my other student, Lu-Ming, faced, which seem to be due to inefficiencies in Lean/mathlib dealing with a seemingly easy object, the group Z-algebra of an order $n$ cyclic group, where he had to check concrete  identities for concrete values of $n$.</p>

<p>I don't think we have stricter requirements for PRs these days compared to when I started 3 years ago. The only significant change I can think of is that you now need to satisfy a bunch of linters, but those were mostly enforced by hand before they became code. (Maybe 3 years ago you could write <code>def</code>s without docstrings. But I don't think writing docstrings is what you consider a problem.)<br>
I'm sure that we all want the contribution process to be as easy as possible. If you have concrete suggestions for something that is hard and could be made easier, please let us know.</p>

<p>I am attaching an excerpt of my "Oxford Guide to Style"; the way I see things is that if an an ellipsis marks the end of an incomplete sentence, it replaces the period (= 3 points). You only have four points whenever a normal complete sentence (with its usual period) is followed by omitted material, and it does not seem to me to be your case. <a href="/user_uploads/3121/1ZusUbBLqd5HycRKAvjUVJpM/The-Oxford-Guide-to-Style.pdf">The-Oxford-Guide-to-Style.pdf</a></p>

<p>Wikipedia seems to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether an ellipsis at the end of a sentence needs a fourth dot to finish the sentence is a matter of debate; Chicago advises it,[8] as does the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA style),[9] while some other style guides do not;[citation needed] the Merriam-Webster Dictionary and related works treat this style as optional, saying that it "may" be used.[10]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you can win internet points by linking to that oxford style guide for the citation needed :)</p>

<p>I did not get that far, I have simply studied one guide to style and it was the Oxford one—whence my comment—but it is nice to see that the matter is debatable :-)</p>
