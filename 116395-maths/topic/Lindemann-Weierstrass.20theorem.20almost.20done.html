<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>I'm happy to tell everyone that I have formalized most of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindemann%E2%80%93Weierstrass_theorem">Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem</a>. The main theorem is <a href="https://github.com/negiizhao/transcendental/blob/master/src/lindemann.lean#L2296">here</a>.</p>

<p>There are still some sorry in the code. Two of them are waiting for <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="321459">@Damiano Testa</span>'s work on <code>is_domain</code> for <code>add_monoid_algebra</code>. And the other two are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_symmetric_polynomial#Fundamental_theorem_of_symmetric_polynomials">fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials</a>. Symmetric polynomials are only used in the very last part of the proof, and I believe it can be replaced by some Galois theory, however, it seems to be the simplest way if we have sufficient infrastructures.</p>
<p>There is also a file <code>e.lean</code> in this repository, that is <em>unrelated</em> to this work. I just reused this repository.</p>
<p>If there is any way to improve my proof, please feel free to give suggestions.</p>

<p><code>K s</code> is a ℚ-vector space, so it's just ring equiv to <code>is_domain (add_monoid_algebra (ι →₀ ℚ) F)</code>.</p>

<p>I see. So you have an independent proof of transcendence of <code>e</code>. Because that mathematical fact is still an input to your proof of Lindemann─Weierstrass, right?</p>

<p>No, it just doesn't need the proof of transcendence of <code>e</code>. I mean <code>e.lean</code> is previously written in this repository and has no relation to this proof.</p>

<p>I'm outlining in Lean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_symmetric_polynomial#Alternative_proof">the second proof in Wikipedia</a> for the symmetric polynomial theorem, which essentially uses <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/finsupp.lex">docs#finsupp.lex</a> that Damiano introduced into mathlib recently (looks like we'll also need well-foundedness apart from linear order). The first thing I observed is that the <code>sorry</code> as stated seems to be wrong: we don't get an isomorphism for comm_semiring because for example x^2+y^2=(x+y)^2+(-2)xy, and -2 doesn't exist in ℕ. However I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="455791">@Yuyang Zhao</span> only applies it to comm_rings, so it should be okay.</p>

<p>Thanks! I didn't check the conditions carefully and the assumption <code>comm_semiring</code> is too weak, but <code>comm_ring</code> is certainly enough.</p>

<p>I don't know anyone who is working on the symmetric polynomial proof. This part of the theory is related to integer partitions or Young diagrams, and their APIs still seem inadequate. I think it might be better to discuss with other people who need these APIs.</p>

<p>I <a href="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Lindemann-Weierstrass.20theorem.20almost.20done/near/298494571">thought about the proof</a> and opened <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/16772">#16772</a> (well-foundedness of lexicographic orders) with the proof as an motivation (the other motivation being <a href="#narrow/stream/217875-Is-there-code-for-X.3F/topic/.22sort.22.20a.20function/near/299256970">this thread</a>). (I proved a much more general result, but deducing what we actually need from the general result is arguably what we should do for mathlib.) However, one dependency <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/16777">#16777</a> of the well-foundedness result hasn't been merged yet, and I haven't returned to the symmetric polynomial proof. As far as I can see, it doesn't have to depend on Young diagrams, but it may be nice to make the connection.</p>
