<p>Is there a convention for when to put the hypothesis to the left of the colon rather than in an implication?<br>
For instance,</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">example</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">ℝ</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">h</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="bp">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="bp">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="kd">by</span> <span class="n">linarith</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>rather than</p>

<p>Between your two examples, I think we generally prefer the former, since it removes the need for the lambda after the <code>:=</code>. So I generally put as many hypotheses to the left of the colon as possible. Sometimes you have to leave some implications or foralls to the right of the colon, especially when using the equation compiler or if the proof uses <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#induction">tactic#induction</a>.</p>

<p>Would the former be preferred even if the proof didn't contain a lambda, but rather a <code>begin</code>-<code>end</code> block?</p>

<p>if the <code>begin .. end</code>-block starts with <code>intros</code> you might as well put those assumptions left of the colon.</p>

<p>It's mostly just about which version uses the least amount of characters to type...</p>

<p>So generally speaking, it is better to put hypotheses to the left of the colon as much as possible.</p>

<p>I see. I can make a pull request to add this convention to Style Guidelines <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/style.html">https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/style.html</a>, since it seems useful.</p>
