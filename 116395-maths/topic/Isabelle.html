<p>I just wanted to thank <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110294">@Johannes Hölzl</span>  for this in Isabelle:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>have &quot;81 * exp(8 * ln 2/21) / 4 ≤ 80/3&quot;
 by (approximation 8)
</pre></div>


<p>(where 80/3 is just some good upper approximation I chose for simplicity, accurate within 1%)</p>

<p>Thanks! How long did it take to figure out 8? And how long did you play around to find the expression which finally worked :-)</p>

<p>To chose a good upper approximation, I computed the continued fraction expansion of <code>81 * exp(8 * ln 2/21) / 4</code> and truncated it to some terms. To figure out the 8, I tried first with 5 but it failed, then 6, then 7, then 8, and it succeeded. Simple enough :) For another numerical approximation in the same file, I had to go up to <code>approximation 17</code> (which I found by dichotomoy), but the proof is still almost instantaneous. That's a wonderful tool! (If I had to give a proof by hand, it would be super-tedious and certainly 100 lines long...)</p>
