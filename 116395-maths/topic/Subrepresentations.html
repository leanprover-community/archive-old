<p>Seeing as the representation theory of groups is being built, would it be worth defining subrepresentations and representation homomorphisms, copying a lot of lemmas over from submodules and linear maps?</p>

<p>My immediate instinct is "yes"! But perhaps others should weigh in. Is there some trick where you deduce everything from <code>submodule</code> and the fact that it's a k[G]-module?</p>

<p>I actually did most of the work for this about a year ago but that was before <code>Rep</code> and <code>representation</code> were defined the way they are now. I essentially copy-pasted the lemmas from <code>submodule</code> and <code>linear_map</code> (before the semilinear map rewrite) with minimal modification</p>

<p>I also made a <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/representation_theory_winstonyin">branch</a> containing some other lemmas for the direct sum of <code>fdRep</code>s. Would very much welcome suggestions towards a PR.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="416472">@Winston Yin</span> I would also say, yes we want these definitions.

<p>I would add that at some point we should probably start leaning on our powerful category theory library for things like this though. For example I note that we have an open PR (which I hope to see merged soon) <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14308">#14308</a> in which certain maps are shown to be morphisms of G-modules using our category theory library.</p>

<p>This latter approach is less well explored though. In the case of <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14308">#14308</a> it is likely a win because I believe our category theory is likely to be very valuable when working with cohomology.</p>

<p>So far I've been doing a little experiment to try to work as much as possible with the category theory library while developping representation theory, which is why we don't have things like <code>rep_hom</code> or <code>rep_equiv</code>. I still think it's good eventually to have both, so feel free to add these things!</p>

<p>Also I noticed on your branch that you go through matrices to prove the formula for the trace of a direct sum. It's ok but you can probably get a much neater proof by using <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/linear_map.trace_eq_contract">docs#linear_map.trace_eq_contract</a> (see the proof of <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/linear_map.trace_prod_map">docs#linear_map.trace_prod_map</a> for an example).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> With the current approach this seems complicated to do because representations don't come with an instance of <code>module (monoid_algebra k G)</code>, due to possibke diamonds in the case of different representations on the same vector space.</p>

<p>What I did last year was to define representation to extent the module class together with a smul commutation condition. I realised that this makes it tricky to compare different representations of the same vector space.</p>
<p>I'll look into simplifying the direct sum proofs with your suggestions <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="329754">@Antoine Labelle</span>, thank you. I find that I am not so good at writing concise proofs but rely much on Lean's automation magic.</p>
<p>I especially find that <code>direct_sum</code>, <code>dfinsupp</code>, etc are quite tricky to use in proofs. Lean frequently has trouble inferring type classes. Variable declarations are generally verbose. <code>rw</code> and <code>subst</code> often don't work because expressions are tucked behind a <code>λ i : ι</code>.  Maybe there's some trick I'm missing.</p>
<p>As for proofs generalised by category theory, I wish I knew enough category theory to help.</p>

<p>For example, currently to specify the character of a representation ρ, one needs to say <code>(fdRep.of ρ).character</code>, when it would be more straightforward to define <code>ρ.character</code> directly</p>

<p>About the <code>representation</code> v.s. <code>Rep</code>/<code>fdRep</code> question, as I mentioned somewhere above I am doing a kind of experiment to see if most of the theory can be developed using the category theory library, which is why <code>character</code> is only defined for <code>fdRep</code>. The idea is that when talking about characters the variables should always be of type <code>fdRep</code> and the construction of new representations should occur as much as possible within <code>fdRep</code>, so that you don't have to do things like <code>(fdRep.of ρ).character</code>. You can look at <a href="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Representation.20Theory/near/286095492">this thread</a> for some discussion about that.</p>

<p>Now, what I've observed is that this works fairly well as long as we can indeed do everything internal to <code>fdRep</code>, but since the API for <code>Rep</code>/<code>fdRep</code>is still something in progress and not fully developed, it's not always possible and sometimes annoying back-and-forth between the categorical and non-categorical libraries is needed. For example <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/representation.lin_hom">docs#representation.lin_hom</a> in categorical language should be <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/category_theory.ihom">docs#category_theory.ihom</a>, but since we don't have yet that <code>Rep</code> and <code>fdRep</code> are closed categories (i.e. <code>ihom</code> is always defined) the statement of <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/fdRep.char_lin_hom">docs#fdRep.char_lin_hom</a> requires <code>fdRep.of</code> (I do plan on adding the closed structure and fixing that in the future though).</p>

<p>But this is really an experiment, so if you want to develop the API for representations in a more classical way, replicating all the <code>linear_map</code> API you're also welcome to do it.</p>

<p>Replicating the <code>linear_map</code> API is not ideal but it’s the most straightforward thing I could do. However, I would also like to understand the benefits of the categorical approach. Is the main idea that the restrictions on V are now contained as a field in the fdRep structure rather than using type class in the hypotheses? How would one express additional conditions on V, say, <code>smul_comm_class k’ k V</code> for some other <code>k’</code>?</p>

<p>I think the main benefit of the categorical approach is precisely to avoid replicating all the API for morphisms, equivalences, subobjects, products, etc. whenever we want to define a new kind of structure. Instead of repeatedly proving the same things in different contexts, it's nice to prove them once and for all for general categories (with suitable extra structure; monoidal, braided, closed, etc.) and then to apply them in various contexts.</p>

<p>If we want to look at representations with additional structure or conditions, we can simply define a new category for these and possibly some forgetful functor that relate it to <code>fdRep</code>.</p>

<p>Made a PR <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/15196">#15196</a> for <code>rep_hom</code> and <code>rep_equiv</code>. I figured I should push these while I try to understand how it works in category theory</p>

<p>I left a few comments. You have a weird linting error that you should try to fix by the way, you can ask for help in another thread if you can't fix it.</p>

<p>I also finally spent some time learning category theory, with the hope that I'll start to understand some of your and Scott's work</p>

<p>For example <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/representation.lin_hom">docs#representation.lin_hom</a> in categorical language should be <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/category_theory.ihom">docs#category_theory.ihom</a>, but since we don't have yet that Rep and fdRep are closed categories</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that <code>lin_hom</code> is not exactly <code>ihom</code> on <code>Rep k G</code>, but rather <code>ihom</code> on <code>Module k</code> that has a G-action. If <code>lin_hom</code> is restricted to linear maps that commute with the G-action, it becomes trivial. Am I missing something?</p>

<p>You're confusing the internal hom <code>ihom</code> with the hom-sets. A priori the internal hom does not need to have anything to do with the hom-sets, and you can check that for the category <code>Rep k G</code> the internal hom is indeed <code>linhom</code> using the definition of <code>ihom</code> as the adjoint of tensor product.</p>

<p>I would be excited to see if we can avoid all this. It's a lot of boilerplate, and perhaps we can just use the category theoretic interface.</p>
