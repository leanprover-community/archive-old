<p>I've searched through mathlib's branches and <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/commit/5e9a55c15883a5a9fb842eb80658363a44f02565">this</a> was the only progress I could find under the scope of Complexity Theory, which has been inactive for over a year. Is there anyone else tackling this front at the moment?</p>

<p>I'm not sure if anyone is actively working on this. I agree it would be great to have some complexity theory in mathlib, just be warned it will require some subtle design decisions and may be difficult as a first project. I'd suggest posting early drafts here on zulip early on for feedback!</p>

<p>Yeah that's what I thought too! I thought about complexity theory because it's a subject I am very interested in. But since I am still green on Lean, I totally agree that I should pick something slightly more constrained first. Thanks for the consideration!</p>
