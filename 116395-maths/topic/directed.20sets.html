<p>I was expecting to find a type <code>[directed α]</code>, to go along with <code>preorder</code>, <code>partial_order</code>, etc. Instead I can only find these:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>/-- A family of elements of α is directed (with respect to a relation `≼` on α)
  if there is a member of the family `≼`-above any pair in the family.  -/
def directed {ι : Sort v} (f : ι → α) := ∀x y, ∃z, f z ≼ f x ∧ f z ≼ f y
/-- A subset of α is directed if there is an element of the set `≼`-above any
  pair of elements in the set. -/
def directed_on (s : set α) := ∀ (x ∈ s) (y ∈ s), ∃z ∈ s, z ≼ x ∧ z ≼ y
</pre></div>

<p>Am I just mean to use <code>directed (id α)</code>? It seems strange that the simplest thing isn't there.</p>

<p>Beware also <code>directed</code> does not include nonempty</p>

<p>AFAIK, those are the only directed set-related things in mathlib</p>
