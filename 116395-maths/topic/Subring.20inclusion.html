<p>Suppose I have a ring <code>R</code> and a (bundled) subring <code>S : subring R</code>. What's the name for the canonical inclusion <code>S -&gt;+* R</code>? I'm sure this is in mathlib, but I can't seem to find it in <code>ring_theory.subring</code></p>

<p>Got it. It's called <code>subring.subtype</code> for some reason...</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="243562">@Adam Topaz</span>  Yup, those <code>foo.subtype</code> names are really confusing. I think we should rename all of them. But never got around to doing it.</p>
