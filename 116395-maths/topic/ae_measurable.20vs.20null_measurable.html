<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110050">@Sebastien Gouezel</span>, it seems to me that it's easier to work with null measurable functions than with a.e. measurable functions. E.g., you can apply all theorems about measurable functions, and once we rewrite basic facts like <code>measure_union</code> for null measurable sets, we can prove other theorems (e.g., about integrals) for null measurable functions right away instead of the current approach (prove for measurable, use the definition of a.e. measurable).</p>
<p>One difficulty I failed to overcome with a.e. measurable functions (disclaimer: it's 1:35 a.m. here, so possibly in fact it's not a hard issue) is to prove (or disprove) a version of <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/ae_measurable.add_measure">docs#ae_measurable.add_measure</a> for a countable sum of measures. UPD: I can do it but it'll be much uglier than for <code>null_measurable</code>.</p>
<p>AFAIR, the main argument pro a.e. measurable functions (besides the fact that we use them now) is that this way we can easily ensure that the coercion of an <code>ae_eq_fun</code> to a function is measurable. I suggest that we use the following trick: (a) ensure that it is measurable whenever possible (<code>if h : âˆƒ f (hf : measurable f), mk f hf.null_measurable = g then h.some else ...</code>) then prove <code>measurable_coe</code> whenever we're ready (probably in <code>simple_func_dense</code>). What do you think?</p>

<p>Another argument pro null measurable functions: most textbooks about measure theory (at least those I've read) use them (and quite often call them just "measurable").</p>

<p>The main point, I think, is in view of the upcoming refactor sketched in <a href="#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/naming.20contest/near/260590829">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/naming.20contest/near/260590829</a>: the right formulation of the most general measurability condition to be able to define an integral is: there exists a function <code>g</code>, almost everywhere equal to <code>f</code> and taking values in a second-countable subspace. This is where we should be heading, and I don't see how this can be expressed through a null_measurable version.</p>

<p>In fact, it can be expressed through a null_measurable version: it is equivalent to the facts that 1) f is null_measurable 2) there exists a second-countable subspace <code>E</code> such that the preimage of the complement of <code>E</code> has measure zero.</p>

<p>But still I have the feeling that the theorems will be easier to prove, first for measurable functions taking values in a second-countable subspace, and then for strongly ae measurable functions by taking a representative as in the first step. The issue is that the results will not hold for all measurable functions in any case, so saying that we apply the results for measurable functions to the completed sigma-algebra will not make sense.</p>

<p>Having said that, I am convinced that the theory can also be built using the <code>null_measurable</code> route using the trick you mention, so if you feel strongly about it you can go ahead! But keep in mind that we will need <code>strongly_measurable</code>(for measurable functions taking values in a second-countable subspace) and <code>strongly_null_measurable</code> (null-measurable function with a second-countable subspace <code>E</code> such that the preimage of the complement of <code>E</code> has measure zero), and that the latter notion is <em>not</em> the former notion for the completed sigma-algebra...</p>

<p>Am I right that you can define both as "the limit of a sequence of (null) measurable simple functions"?</p>

<p>Anyway, (a) I formalized <code>ae_measurable.sum_measure</code>, so I feel no urge to refactor; (b) rewriting (some of) basic facts in terms of <code>null_measurable_set</code>s wouldn't harm.</p>

<p><code>strongly_measurable</code> would be: the everywhere limit of a sequence of measurable simple functions. <code>strongly_null_measurable</code> would be: the almost everywhere limit of a sequence of measurable simple functions. But it would <em>not</em> be: the everywhere limit of a sequence of null-measurable simple functions (as such an everywhere limit takes values in a second-countable subspace).</p>

<p>It seems that I'm too sleepy to say something useful. Also it seems that we'll need an <code>ae_measurable</code>-style trick anyway, so there is no need to refactor.</p>

<p>One question: when we have <code>strongly_measurable</code> functions (or <code>strongly_null_measurable</code>/<code>strongly_ae_measurable</code>), do we have a need for <code>measurable</code> functions without the <code>strong</code> part?<br>
For second-countable spaces the concepts coincide, and for non-second-countable spaces it seems like the only well-behaved functions are the strongly_measurable ones.</p>

<p>Ok, fair. But almost everything related to integrals will be formulated in terms of <code>strongly_measurable</code>, right?</p>

<p>I just realized that <code>strongly_measurable</code> only makes sense for topological spaces. Then indeed we want <code>measurable</code> for spaces that are not assumed to be a topological space.</p>
