<p>Is there a tactic for categories similar to <code>slice_lhs</code> which prunes away components of morphisms that already match up on both sides? I'd assume that's sometimes more efficient than just modifying small subterms until _everything_ matches up on both sides? /cc <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="260921">@Markus Himmel</span></p>

<p><code>congr</code> can sometimes do things like this. Personally I tend to avoid <code>slice_lhs</code> these days, usually you can find pure rewrite proofs which are much shorter without it. A particular trick which is super useful is to use <code>assoc</code> in the forward direction as much as you can, and then use reassociated versions of lemmas where needed</p>

<p><code>congr</code> often misfires though. Reassociating and applying <code>whisker_eq</code> also does the trick, I noticed. Using reassociated lemmas is a good point, maybe I can use that to golf <a href="https://github.com/javra/mathlib/blob/002adeeda39f23dfbcbc81a1d439fa47595a374f/src/category_theory/monoidal/rigid.lean#L117-L146">this monster</a> a bit...</p>

<p>You can use <code>congr' 1</code> or variants to refine it better as well</p>
