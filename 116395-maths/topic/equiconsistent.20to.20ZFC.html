<p>is it true that to show that a formal system is equiconsistent to ZFC, I have to construct a model of that formal system in ZFC? and is that enough? also do you say "equiconsistent to" or "equiconsistent with" lol</p>

<p>let's say i have a smart friend that doesn't believe in the consistency of Euclidean geometry. to convince them of its consistency, I have to construct a model of Euclidean geometry by:</p>
<ul>
<li>constructing natural numbers</li>
<li>integers</li>
<li>rationals</li>
<li>reals</li>
<li>analytic geometry</li>
</ul>
<p>in ZFC and show that the analytic geometry model that I constructed satisfies the axioms of Euclidean geometry<br>
is that correct</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="270523">@Huỳnh Trần Khanh</span>, I recommend titling your topics something that summarizes its content rather than something devoid of information like you have here (was: "is my thinking correct"); it increases the chance of someone interested in answering seeing your post, and of you ever finding it again.</p>
<p>You can edit the topic of your above message.</p>

<p>ah maybe to construct analytic geometry I have to construct calculus and complex numbers too... but you get the idea...</p>

<p>It is almost never true in mathematics that to prove X you <em>have</em> to use method Y.</p>

<p>Your construction of a model of Euclid's axioms is within ZFC, so as long as your friend believes in the consistency of ZFC this looks like a fine proof. In other words, it's a proof of Con(ZFC) -&gt; Con(Euclid)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Actually, if you construct a model of formal system T in ZFC, then you have proved that T is <em>not</em> equiconsistent with ZFC, because you have proven ZFC |- Con(T), or Con(T) &lt; Con(ZFC) (i.e. the consistency strength of T is strictly less than that of ZFC)</p>

<p>This will prove that ZFC |- Con(EuclidGeom), or Con(ZFC) -&gt; Con(EuclidGeom). That is to say, this is a <em>relative</em> consistency proof, of euclidean geometry relative to ZFC. Pretty much all consistency proofs are actually relative consistency proofs, but it means that you can convince your hypothetical friend not that euclidean geometry is consistent, but that if they doubt the consistency of euclidean geometry then they must also doubt the consistency of ZFC. (Usually this is still useful, since ZFC will generally be more studied than the theory being proven consistent, in this case euclidean geometry.)</p>

<p>lol thanks and I'll say "equiconsistent <em>with</em>" from now on because everyone says equiconsistent <em>with</em> and I'm the odd one out <span aria-label="big smile" class="emoji emoji-1f604" role="img" title="big smile">:big_smile:</span></p>
