<p>I think in a chapter on tactics, you want exercises like the one you had on the semi-quasi-demi-presheaves. The exercise says: try to prove this lemma with all the tactics you have seen so far (and maybe you give an explicit list). And then the reader gets stuck (they should be warned that it is your point to get them stuck). And then you teach them a new tactic (in this case <code>change</code>).</p>

<p>That way, maybe we will recognise where to apply that tactic in the future. Because we will get stuck with our standard toolkit, and realise "oh, I remember this kind of stuckness from an exercise in LftWM. I need to use <code>change</code>!"</p>
