<p>We already have a web page listing <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad_todo.html">missing undergrad stuff</a> but it's not so easy to read quickly. I just created  a <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/wiki/Big-missing-undergraduate-theorems">wiki page</a> which I think is easier to read. First I'd be happy to learn that some items are actually already done. Then I think it would be really good to spend some time and energy to work on this list this year. It would be really awesome to clean it before next summer's ICM. I think some of the energy that currently goes in either much more advanced stuff or much more exotic things could go there.</p>

<p>I don't think I'll be able to contribute to anything on that list. However, I have some plans myself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finishing Sperner's lemma. Maybe doing Brouwer's fixed point theorem or Monsky's theorem afterwards.</li>
<li>Equivalence of regular expressions and DFA (probably feat <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="267202">Fox Thomson</span>)</li>
<li>Working towards Szemerédi's theorem. That probably includes moving Kyle's paths branch towards master.</li>
<li>More maintenance stuff in order theory/convex analysis</li>

<p>Yaël, why do you write "I don't think I'll be able to contribute"? Do you mean you won't have time or you don't know enough math? I'm pretty sure you know enough or could learn easily. For instance the group representation stuff is really elementary.</p>

<p>About CLT, I don't think we should aim for an elementary proof, unless it gives motivation to develop probability tools that will be useful anyway. It would be really nice to precisely state what you need from complex analysis. The real test for a complex analysis library should be to prove the prime number theorem and CLT, and Dirichlet arithmetic progressions theorem</p>

<p>The proof of the CLT I have in mind uses some tools that are more widely useful, like facts about convergences of random variables based on the convergence of the moments or lemmas about a reduction to the case of bounded random variables. It's also more widely generalizable than the usual (Fourier based) method.<br>
But i agree that we should aim at being able to write that Fourier proof as well. I will check what is needed.</p>

<p>I think that I get your point: the proof of the CLT based on Fourier transforms is valuable as a test of another part of the library. I agree.<br>
I also want the tools from the other proof, but we can have both :)</p>
<p>I must admit that I have a bias against proofs using the Fourier method and I am more familiar with moment-based techniques because my usual work focuses on applications for which moments are the only approach that works. But I can overcome that bias.</p>

<p>I agree with Rémy that the Fourier proof is too specific, and that we should go for another one. What about the Stein method? :-) Joke aside, moments arguments and truncation are tools of a very general use, so this would definitely be a nice proof to have.</p>

<p>For probability in general and CLT in particular, I think the proposed approaches sound good! The most standard CLT proof based on complex analysis and Fourier analysis of measures should also hopefully become doable. I apologize that PRing my proof of the Portmanteau theorem has stalled a bit (funding applications and semester got in the way of my Leaning), but I definitely plan to go ahead, so that it wouldn't be blocking one natural approach to the CLT. Not all of Portmanteau is needed for the standard CLT proof anyway, and on the other hand I have not included the <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="double-struck">R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\R</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68889em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathbb">R</span></span></span></span>-specific characterizations such as the one with the Fourier transform in what I plan to PR for now. In any case, besides the Portmanteau characterizations of convergence in distribution, for the standard proof of CLT one needs some compactness argument (Helly's selection theorem or the much more general Prokhorov's theorem). I hope to work on Prokhorov at some point in the future unless someone gets to it first (but Helly is a lot cheaper approach sufficient for the CLT).</p>
<p>(Btw, I think Sébastien's joke about the Stein's method for the CLT is interesting (I considered this in the past), except that the version of Stein's method I have seen does not give a proof of CLT with the optimal assumptions. It does give convergence rates, though, unlike the standard proof! Ok, this is becoming too CLT-specific, apologies! [Feel free to move to another topic.])</p>
<p>Anyway, I like the "Missing theorems" wiki page! <span aria-label="heart" class="emoji emoji-2764" role="img" title="heart">:heart:</span></p>

<p>It seems mathlib currently just defines <code>is_semisimple_module</code> as a <code>is_complemented</code>, which is a bit lame, but in any case orthogonal to anything about Maschke's theorem and/or finite groups, so I removed Maschke from the wiki page and added it to  undergrad.yaml.</p>

<p>I think a good thing to do would be to show that an isomorphism between sums of simple modules gives a bijection between summands, with each pair in bijection isomorphic. There's nothing even about modules or algebra here; it holds in any preadditive category.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="387244">@Yaël Dillies</span>, I don't actually know a reference that does this for any preadditive category. It's easy though: the work is handling an induction. The inductive step goes as follows.</p>
<p>If you have a nonempty sum of simple objects isomorphic to some sum of simple objects, then must be a pair of isomorphic objects: otherwise an entire column of the isomorphism is zero, which is impossible by <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/category_theory.biprod.column_nonzero_of_iso/src">src#category_theory.biprod.column_nonzero_of_iso</a>.

<p>Complex inner products have been in mathlib for about a year now, in the form <code>[inner_product_space ℂ E]</code>. We just added semilinear maps a few days ago, so we should be defining the adjoint properly very soon and the spectral theorem shouldn't be too far behind.</p>

<p>Before Rémy answers, let me already point out a few things...</p>
<p>There has been some discussion about LLN. At least <a href="#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/Giry.20monad/near/178130757">a proof following Terry Tao's blog</a> has been considered, but it might be that <a href="#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/37/near/202218943">a martingale proof</a> is in some people's mind; note that <a href="#narrow/stream/116290-rss/topic/Recent.20Commits.20to.20mathlib.3Amaster/near/264377957">martingales have been defined already</a>. I don't know if anyone has started either of these LLN proofs, though.</p>
<p>For the CLT, we don't yet have even convergence in distribution, but that is hopefully on its way in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9430">#9430</a> and <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9943">#9943</a>. With that and a definition of Gaussian measures, at least <em>stating</em> the CLT properly should become possible. After these PRs, I would be trying to follow up with the portmanteau theorem, but the characterization by characteristic functions is not included in <a href="https://github.com/kkytola/lean_portmanteau">my draft</a>. It seems to me more Fourier analysis would be needed for that (at least Lévy's inversion theorem). You probably already saw the <a href="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Missing.20theorems/near/254920950">main proposals in this thread</a>, which were not the standard Fourier-based proofs. Also <a href="#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Missing.20theorems/near/254924681">proving CLT by Stein's method</a> would not require Fourier analysis (but I don't think that option was entertained seriously). Again, I don't really know if anyone has started except that I'm slowly trying to bring in the basics of convergence in distribution.</p>
