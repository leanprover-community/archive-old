<p>We have this canonical 1st year (in UK at least) theorem that we teach many 1st years: equivalence relations are the same thing as partitions. Am I right in thinking that <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/partition.order_iso">docs#partition.order_iso</a> is the way we say "there's a bijection between equivalence classes and partitions" but that this result is essentially never used in mathlib? Even the file it's in, <code>data.setoid.partition</code> is never imported, and it's barely used in that file either.</p>
<p>It was great for teaching though! The original proof was by an IC student and I'm sure they learnt a lot about Lean doing little projects like that.</p>

<p>Yep, <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/setoid.partition.order_iso">docs#setoid.partition.order_iso</a> is the bijection between equivalence classes and partitions.  <code>setoid</code> conveniently packages up a relation with it's proof that it's an equivalence relation, and the right-hand side could be written as <code>{p : set (set Î±) | setoid.is_partition p}</code> (with an implicit coercion to <code>subtype</code>).  (I realize you're not asking about this, but it took me a little while to work out what that was doing.)</p>

<p>I didn't know about the <code>has_le</code> on <code>setoid</code>.  I guess <code>s &lt;= t</code> iff the equivalence classes for <code>s</code> are a refinement of those of <code>t</code>.</p>

<p>This file is used in LTE.</p>

<p>Must be a sign that we're finally doing serious maths</p>

<p>We only use that file in LTE because mathlib's topological spaces haven't been replaced by condensed sets yet <span aria-label="wink" class="emoji emoji-1f609" role="img" title="wink">:wink:</span></p>
