<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="302826">@Aaron Anderson</span> and I have been talking about doing some model theory in Lean. It seems like the path forward involves PRing some of the basic stuff from the flypitch project into mathlib. Does that seem sane? Has this project already been started? <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="111080">@Floris van Doorn</span>?</p>

<p>one of the goals of this would be to prove goedel's incompleteness theorem "the right way" (I don't know, Aaron's the model theorist, not me) and knock it off of freek's list</p>

<p>I'm largely interested in the transfer principles that flypitch has already stated they want to do at some point. A few concrete examples would be using the theory of real closed fields to prove Hilbert's 17th, and proving Ax-Grothendieck.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="300601">@Luiz Carlos Rumbelsperger Viana</span> has some nice FOL at <a href="https://github.com/maxd13/logic-soundness">https://github.com/maxd13/logic-soundness</a>, so far a proof of soundness but also intention for it to serve as a framework. I'm not sure what's at stake in the divergences between their approach to FOL and that of flypitch, and if one or the other is used, it's probably easier to port Luiz's soundness proof to the flypitch encoding than vice-versa. Just mentioning because when reading Luiz's work I thought, "why shouldn't this be in mathlib"?</p>

<p>compactness is already there, so what you need for Ax-Grothendieck is a definition of ACF and the fact that it's complete in characteristic 0</p>
<p>i would suggest going the route of showing that ACF admits quantifier elimination, and then using the equivalence of QE with substructure-completeness (it might help if you work in ACF conservatively expanded with symbols for every rational)</p>

<p>That is essentially the approach I'd take. I'd believe that the necessary functionality's all there in flypitch, I just don't have much experience with Lean yet, and Jalex found issues with mathlib compatibility when we started tinkering.</p>

<p>there isn't an API for quantifier elimination; the closest thing is a definition of what it means to be quantifier-free, and an induction on quantifier depth in <code>fol.lean</code> (<code>term_model_ssatisfied_iff</code>) in the proof of completeness for Henkin theories</p>

<p>For the induction schema, I'm sure you have enough substitution definitions to pull this off, but to talk about it more naturally, I think we might want a "variable-tuple" to be a fintype, whose elements are variables.</p>

<p>For instance, one could define <code>x</code> to be a singleton, <code>y</code> to be a variable-tuple on <code>fin n</code>, define <code>φ</code> to be a formula on variable <code>x ⊕ y</code>, or perhaps a formula on two variable-tuples, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.</p>

<p>it is certainly more idiomatic to use finite tuples of variables/constants, and it's important to build that kind of API around the syntactic foundations if serious model theory is to be done</p>
<p>(note that when the theories are multi-sorted, you have to keep track of what sort the variables belong to also)</p>

<p>Yeah, at some point, one has to decide whether it's better to make everything fundamentally multi-sorted one-sorted, and I imagine the decision is based around whether it's shorter to type a multi-sorted-to-one-sorted workaround or a one-sorted-to-multi-sorted workaround.</p>

<p>Perhaps in a multi-sorted system you can handle the question of variable-tuples by making the cartesian products and powers of "basic sorts" into sorts themselves, and then you can just quantify over <code>M ^ n</code>, but that might make referencing the sub-variables too much of a mess</p>

<p>It would take a long time, but I could do some parts. I could perhaps start by making some API to convert between different class instances related to various rings and their model-theoretic counterparts. In my current project I have done this for commutative rings and fields, so I could make this a bit more general. The idea is just to make instances of <code>fact (M |= ring_theory)</code> and so on and have nice instances going in between. It's been nice so far because if use this to show <code>comm_ring M</code> and <code>field M</code> and so on, everything works together quite nicely. I can for example take a model of <code>ACF</code> and automatically have it as a commutative ring and field etc, all compatible instances.</p>

<p>A few ideas occur to me now:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can make it so that <code>M |= ring_theory</code> is a class instance, without the need for <code>fact</code></li>
<li>We could put in the example of Rings first, but I think that there should be classes for "a language with +" and "a language with *" that lead directly to <code>has_add</code> and <code>has_mul</code> instances on terms.</li>
<li>Perhaps to work out some of my design issues independently of your algebra work, I can work on orders and graphs. If I define ordered structures, and <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/12611">#12611</a> goes through, then I can define o-minimality.</li>
</ul>

<p>the first two points look like great ideas. As for the third, do you mean I should wait until you iron out any problems with the current setup before starting to make ring related PRs? By the way, I noticed that you chose to go with the usual definition of terms, rather than the de Bruijn-like definition from flypitch - is this working out well? I also noticed you didn't introduce notation for terms and bounded formulas, will this be added soon?</p>

<p>I am adding some of that Flypitch notation in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/12630">#12630</a> - let me know if there’s other notation I’m missing</p>

<p>You can make ring-related PRs as soon as you want to, and if you find problems with my setup, you can let me know.</p>

<p>If I understand correctly the de Bruijn way of defining terms makes induction easier, since we only introduct a single term at a time in the induction, rather than <code>n</code> of them at once</p>
