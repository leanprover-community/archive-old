<p>It's generally a bad idea to use universe bumping constructions because they can't be iterated, so we do a fair bit of work to keep things "small", resulting in size considerations not unlike those you find in ZFC formalization</p>

<p>The biggest blocker to formalizing cardinals without type 1 is that you have to take a quotient, so you really have to apply <code>quotient.{1}</code> unless you want setoid hell. But if you are okay with this, then cardinals are just types with an equivalence relation on them (and actually we already have such a thing, it's what <code>data.equiv</code> does), and you can construct ordinals in a similar way as an equivalence relation on bundled well orders, and then you don't need to leave Type 0 to do ordinals and cardinals</p>

<p>The story with <code>Set</code> is similar, it's a quotient of <code>pSet</code> so maybe you can just live without it. But <code>pSet</code> is really a higher universe inductive:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="sd">/-- The type of pre-sets in universe `u`. A pre-set</span>
<span class="sd">  is a family of pre-sets indexed by a type in `Type u`.</span>
<span class="sd">  The ZFC universe is defined as a quotient of this</span>
<span class="sd">  to ensure extensionality. -/</span>
<span class="kd">inductive</span> <span class="n">pSet</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">u</span><span class="bp">+</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">)</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>This quantifies over all types in the universe in order to populate the inductive, which gives it a lot of unique properties (like having an inaccessible cardinality), so I'm pretty sure you can't do this in Type 0 (not least because this inductive can be turned into a model of ZFC).</p>

<p>In fact, when resolving singularities by blow-ups, you can run into a situation where you do one blow up and then you can get any finite number of isolated singularities in the resulting blow up.  Of course, on any given example you can then resolve each by a finite number of blow ups, but there is no a priori upper bound on the number.</p>
<p>However, if you have a bounded family of varieties, then I think that there is a bound on the number of blow ups, as a function of the family.  These bounds tend to be gigantic, though.</p>

<p>This, however, does not necessarily mean that to "resolve singularities" you <em>need</em> to have these unbounded construction.  It is simply saying that it is <em>sufficient</em> to do this!  It is possible that there are different strategies for resolution that do not depend on doing blow ups...</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Right, this is the kind of not-useful bound I mean. If you translate this to a lean proof, the proof itself is required to be at least as large as the bound you want, meaning that if the bound depends on the instance itself then a finite fragment of mathlib is only going to be able to prove properties about a small fraction of all varieties and only with stupidly long proofs</p>

<p>I like the definition of Picard group!  As I am learning Lean, I also realize that what is more important is how to relate it to other equivalent versions.  In the case of Picard groups, the "divisors up to linear equivalence" point of view is also very useful.</p>

<p>This other approach might involve fewer universe jumps, but I do not really have a feeling for these universe issues.</p>

<p>So ring-theoretically the divisor rather than sheaf approach is of course like using ideals rather than modules</p>

<p>Yes, it is more "intrinsic", since you can work inside the ring itself, rather than "moving out" to modules.  Honestly, my intuition for universes is closer to how I would think about first- and second- order sentences and range of quantification.  Maybe this is not the right perspective.</p>

<p>Ideals do seem like a natural concept though. With valuations one seemed to have to move to some rather strange preorder -- two valuations v and w on a ring R are equivalent iff v(r)&lt;=v(s) &lt;-&gt; w(r)&lt;=w(s).</p>
