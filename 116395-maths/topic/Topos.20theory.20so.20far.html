<p>Hi, just curious what's the current status of topos theory in Lean?</p>

<p>which kind of topos?</p>

<p>Grothendieck topos</p>

<p>We have the concept of a sheaf on a site, and that's pretty much it. But Bhavik has a load of work on elementary topoi.</p>

<p>oh cool! That's presumably on the logic side of things? How about on the geometric side? (E.g. connected morphisms)</p>

<p>Not much on the geometric side - we don't even have geometric morphisms yet! I think they're very much within reach though, and I think it wouldn't be too hard to define a grothendieck topos as a category equivalent to a category of sheaves on a small site, and do geometric morphisms on them</p>
