<p>In about 7 hours, at 3pm EST (UTC-5), I'm going to give a Zoom talk at the Harvard New Technologies in Mathematics seminar on our <code>gptf</code> tactic and the PACT method we use to train the current version.  There will be a demo.  Here is <a href="https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/3-3-2021-new-tech-in-math/">the abstract and Zoom link</a>.  I also think it will be recorded and put on YouTube.</p>

<p>Oh nice! I gave a talk there a few months ago and Yau (big shot geometer) was in the audience. I think Hales spoke there recently -- they put my talk on YT so hopefully yours and Hales' will also end up there too</p>

<p>We would love to have you try out the <code>gptf</code> tactic.  See the instructions at  <a href="https://github.com/jesse-michael-han/lean-gptf">https://github.com/jesse-michael-han/lean-gptf</a> .  (It is fairly easy to setup.  You don't have to install any special software or anything like that, besides Lean of course.  The model runs in the cloud.)</p>
