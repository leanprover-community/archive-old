<p>Planned features:</p>
<ul>
<li>special support for <code>rw</code>, <code>simp</code></li>
<li>special support for <code>exact</code></li>
<li>premise selection/lemma suggestion</li>
<li>full push-button proof search (currently, <code>gptf</code> performs one-step lookahead on all the predictions returned by the model)</li>
<li>support for running your own transformer language model locally</li>
</ul>
<p>ideas welcome!</p>

<p>Would it be feasible to have some kind of caching mechanism for suggestions? Right now I can use vscode-lean's copy-to-comment button to put the suggestions in a comment, but this ends up modifying the Lean file, which then triggers the server to run <code>gptf</code> again. Maybe we should have the infoview handle this sort of thing.</p>

<p>ah, it would be nice to have a custom interaction monad <code>begin [gptf] ... end</code> which runs a <code>state_t search_state tactic</code> --- then the user would be able to step through the entire breadth-first search, reorder the search queue, manually backtrack, look up previous predictions, etc.</p>
<p>the <code>smt</code> mode does a similar caching of <code>ematch</code> lemmas (indeed, the <code>smt</code> mode is just <code>state_t smt_state tactic</code>)</p>
