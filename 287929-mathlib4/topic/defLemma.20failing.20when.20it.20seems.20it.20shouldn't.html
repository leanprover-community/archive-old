<p>When does the <code>defLemma</code> linter fail or not? For example, I have one definition whose return type is a structure with a single equality argument, and that's fine. But if the return type is a structure with one data field and one equality argument, that's not. Is this a relevant factor?</p>

<p>If I replace <code>theorem</code> with <code>def</code>, I get a much scarier error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>unsupported <code>Mathlib.Meta.NormNum.IsNat.casesOn</code> application during code generation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm wondering if this warrants a <code>[nolint defLemma]</code>.</p>

<p>This particular issue was worked around on <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/1441">mathlib4#1441</a>, so I guess it doesn't matter anymore! :)</p>
