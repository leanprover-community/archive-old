<p>I haven't looked into this closely, but I'm hoping e.g. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="111080">@Floris van Doorn</span> may be able to give a quick answer here.</p>
<p>There are some missing <code>to_additive</code> attributes in <code>Mathlib/Algebra/Group/Defs.lean</code>, e.g.</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1">-- TODO restore @[to_additive zsmul_eq_smul]</span>
<span class="kd">@[simp]</span>
<span class="kd">theorem</span> <span class="n">zpow_eq_pow</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">ℤ</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">G</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">DivInvMonoid.zpow</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="bp">^</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">:=</span>
  <span class="n">rfl</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>These attributes don't work, I think because of the switched order of arguments. What is the status of this? Do we need more support from <code>to_additive</code>? Or are there just some attributes missing elsewhere?</p>

<p>This required an extension in <code>to_additive</code>, I recall it used to not work in mathlib either</p>

<p>In mathlib3 it seems to work. Maybe <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="121918">@Edward Ayers</span> can give an overview of the missing features / known bugs in <code>@[to_additive]</code>. I haven't watched it closely after he took over.</p>

<p>All of the features of to_additive from the lean3 version should be present (if not correct) in mathlib4. So we have all the attributes like <code>to_additive_reorder</code> and so on that are needed for the fiddly cases like pow → smul. I can't debug Scott's example above but there should be an attribute that can be added to help, maybe to <code>Pow</code>.</p>
<p>But there are going to be bugs because the rules for converting are quite subtle. There are also some issues with how number literals work that needed to be modified. I am also worried that it won't work right for heterogeneous versions of the operators. I got it working on most of a ported lean3 unit test file and the basic group theory lemmas that were in mathlib4 at the time, with the hope that more bugs would arise as people use it.</p>
