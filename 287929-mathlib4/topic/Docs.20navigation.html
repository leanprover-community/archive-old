<p>In an <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/doc-gen4/issues/99">issue</a> on the doc-gen4 repo, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="395550">@Henrik Böving</span> and I have been discussion how to deal with the left sidebar display of names which are both a folder and a file.  For instance<br>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/tree/master/Mathlib">Mathlib the folder</a> vs <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/master/Mathlib.lean">Mathlib the file</a><br>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/tree/master/Mathlib/Tactic/Linarith">Mathlib.Tactic.Linarith the folder</a> vs <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/master/Mathlib/Tactic/Linarith.lean">Mathlib.Tactic.Linarith the file</a><br>
Usually the situation is that the file represents the default things from the folder that one would want to import somewhere else.</p>
<p>Currently these are displayed in the left sidebar of the docs by making the folder name a hyperlink to the associated file.  This has the problem that the screen real-estate to click through to the contents of the folder becomes very small: just the tiny <code>▸</code> next to the folder name.  This is particularly awkward in the case of Mathlib itself and other top-level folders, because it means that navigating to any file in Mathlib requires first finding the tiny <code>▸</code> on the homepage and clicking it.</p>
<p>I proposed just deleting the docs pages associated to folder-namesake files, but Henrik points out that </p>
<ul>
<li>in small projects, the repository-namesake file might actually contain content</li>
<li>even in the typical situation where a folder-namesake file is just a list of imports (and therefore the associated docs page is completely empty), that list of imports still generates useful information in the right sidebar (Imports/Imported by)</li>
</ul>
<p>So let's discuss. I would like a solution in which the folder gets more screen real estate than the file.  The best display I can currently think of is</p>
<p>▸ Mathlib (<a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib.html">file</a>)</p>
<p>Maybe we could also systematically put comments in such files, like we did in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/algebra/ring/default.lean">default files</a> in mathlib3, so that they don't show up completely empty in the docs.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/leanprover/doc-gen4/issues/101">Another issue I opened</a> would help a little bit here, by circumventing this problem in the case I encounter most often (Mathlib itself).</p>

<p>Is it sufficient to make the file doc always expand the folder in the sidebar?</p>

<p>That way if you misclick you still get the expanded thing</p>

<p>I was planning to implement Heather's solution once std4 and mathlib4 are compatible again but we can also do that if the majority thinks it would be better.</p>

<p>I think Eric's solution would be fine, but in that case we should have a convention of writing documentation in import-only files, so that users don't get confused by the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Tactic/Linarith.html">blank pages</a> that turn up in these cases.</p>
<p>I also still think that it would be fine to drop any import-only file from the documentation, even though technically this results in a loss of information (its imports and what it's imported by).  Compare <code>linarith</code> in mathlib3: as far as I can tell there's no docs page for <br>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/tactic/linarith/default.lean">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/tactic/linarith/default.lean</a><br>
and so it's not documented anywhere what you get when you <code>import tactic.linarith</code>.</p>

<p>I was working on a lean 3 patch to fix the missing default files in doc-gen; right now we cant detect files from within lean that dont have either docstrings or declarations.</p>
