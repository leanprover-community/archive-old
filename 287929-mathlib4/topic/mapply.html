<p>Hi,<br>
I have some questions regarding my assignment.<br>
1) Am I correct in assuming the difference between the Lean3 version and the Lean4 version will be that the Lean4 version of <code>mapply</code> uses <code>apply</code> with a higher <code>MetavarContext</code> depth instead of the flag?<br>
2) I am not fully understanding what is meant in the Lean3 documentation by "matching" instead of "unification". My working knowledge is that <code>apply</code> (or <code>refine</code>) create new meta-variables and then put a partial proof-term into the goal meta-variable (please correct me if I am using the wrong words or I am misunderstanding something) and I guess is referred to as unification. What is matching?<br>
3) <code>mapply</code> seems to have no tests and is not used anywhere in mathlib, are there any examples on what <code>mapply</code> succeeds on which <code>apply</code> cannot do. There might be the related question whether <code>mapply</code> is useful to have in the first place, but for the sake of tactics porting this is of course not relevant.</p>

<p>If <code>mapply</code> isn't used in mathlib, we can probably skip it</p>
