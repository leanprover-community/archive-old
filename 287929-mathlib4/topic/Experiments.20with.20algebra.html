<p>Hello,<br>
During the past few days, I have worked on some basic group theory in Lean 4, and since there is an open debate on how to port algebra to Lean 4, I thought that some things that I have done in my repo might be interesting. The main point is that I have tried a slightly different approach than that of mathlib 3, and I also used some of the new features of Lean 4 : improved coercion and notations.<br>
All this is detailed in the _readme_ of my repo (which I don't paste right here to not flood the channel)</p>
<p>Hope you will find this interesting !</p>

<p>So you have fully bundled groups? I think that there are some problems which the Coq people experience with this approach and which we don't have in Lean, but I don't know what these problems are.</p>

<p>I'm far from having group theory, but what I got looks promising to me (yet I don't believe it is mathlib-worthy for the moment, it is still possible that I hit a wall at some point). The main problem that I encountered as of now is the way Lean handles notation, and it can be solved with metaprogramming, but I didn't experiment enough to be sure my approach is viable.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here's a more detail :</p>
<p>I have fairly complicated objects that I'm able to define easily enough, for instance <a href="https://github.com/thejohncrafter/playlean4/blob/26f68644637181a98273281d70b046f04f927ccd/Playlean4/Group/LRClasses.lean#L35-L47">cosets and canonical actions on cosets</a>. This allows me to prove that <a href="https://github.com/thejohncrafter/playlean4/blob/26f68644637181a98273281d70b046f04f927ccd/Playlean4/Group/Normal.lean">a subgroup is normal iff it is the kernel of a morphism</a>.<br>
If you look at the code (by the way, according  to the timestamps, you missed my latest commit where I entierely move the laws of groups <em>outside of any typeclass</em>), everything is pretty straightforward : no complicated management of instances/corecions/anything (that's mainly thanks to Lean 4 <span aria-label="tada" class="emoji emoji-1f389" role="img" title="tada">:tada:</span>).<br>
A great part of the code is actually just definitions of namespaces and instantiations of objects. Yet at the moment I have to perform <a href="https://github.com/thejohncrafter/playlean4/blob/26f68644637181a98273281d70b046f04f927ccd/Playlean4/Group/Basic.lean#L29-L33">hacks like here</a> too often, which is a pain and means my approach is not "mathlib-worthy" for now, but this could easily be solved by metaprogramming, and maybe a hint of hacking in Lean (hopefully...).<br>
There is one other problem that I can't avoid (and that may actually be structurally unavoidable) : I often have to refer explicitly to some instance of <code>Group</code> when I do things that are not obvious enough to Lean. See <a href="https://github.com/thejohncrafter/playlean4/blob/26f68644637181a98273281d70b046f04f927ccd/Playlean4/Group/Basic.lean#L36">here</a>, where I have to use explicitly <code>grp.invertible</code> instead of <code>invertible</code>. That is because (I guess) when I only use <code>invertible</code> Lean can't know which group law I want  to refer to (even though, in this context, there obviously is only one possible law), so it asks for an explicit call.</p>

<p>Without having thought about it much, it seems odd to bundle <code>1</code> but not <code>(*)</code> into <code>Group</code>.</p>

<p>I do this because <code>1</code> is uniquely defined once we have a group law. Same for <code>inverse</code>, it is unique so I can just make <code>Group</code> give it to me once I give the law.<br>
The other, more trivial benefit is that I do not need to add an argument like <code>one  : G</code> each time I instantiate a group, but doing it wouldn't actually be a problem modulo metaprogramming.<br>
But sure, this is a bit unnatural if we consider the full algebraic hierarchy : for instance we might want to specify the unit alongside the law when we're dealing with monoids :)</p>
