<p>While porting Algebra.Regular.Basic (<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/758">mathlib4#758</a>), <code>to_additive</code> has not been finding the correct translations. I can fix most of the problems by giving an explicit name for the additive version of <code>IsLeftRegular</code> and <code>IsRightRegular</code>, but roughly 9 theorems still fail. Should those be duplicated manually for now or is there an easy fix to <code>to_additive</code>? I'm not really sure how to debug such things.</p>

<p>Hi, I think that I was the author of the file.  When I added the <code>to_additive</code> conversion, I also added a dictionary entry to <code>to_additive</code> to convert <code>regular</code> to <code>add_regular</code> and the <code>left/right</code> variants.  I cannot see now how to do a similar change for the mathlib4 version of <code>to_additive</code>, but hopefully this explains why the attribute does not find the right name.</p>

<p>I'm on mobile, so I cannot help much, but these are the mathlib lines that I added:</p>

<p>Side note: <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="560559">@Richard Osborn</span> just FYI: you marked <code>Algebra.Regular.Basic</code> with a <code>Yes</code> on the port status wiki. The <code>Yes</code> is reserved for PRs that have already been merged, and marking it too early could cause issues. It's not a big deal, I've already fixed it, I'm just informing.</p>
