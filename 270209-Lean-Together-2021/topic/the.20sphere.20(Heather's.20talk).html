<p>if you want to prove that rotations are smooth... I guess this becomes easier if you know that the sphere is a <em>submanifold</em>, right?</p>

<p>Heather I think what your work gives is huge evidence that the manifold library is solid. This is great!</p>
<p>The reason I mentioned Grassmannians was for the following very silly one. We can now say "Lean has spheres!" but of course the HoTT people can reply "HoTT has spheres and furthermore they're defined in 3 lines and not 1200". Of course the difference is that a HoTT sphere is synthetic and yours are analytic, but people who are only paying a superficial interest won't be able to tell the difference. My understanding is that it is not known how to make Grassmannians synthetically -- we "don't know the generators and relations" in some sense -- so it would be something to tell someone who says "HoTT has spheres".</p>

<p>This would be a nice algebra exercise, the geometry exercise comes when you want to put a manifold structure on the Grassmannian.</p>

<p>Yes, HoTT's sphere are simplicial, if you like. They're inductive types, because the model in HoTT is that a type is a top space up to homotopy, whereas the model in Lean is that a type is a set.</p>

<p>So the claim in the HoTT systems that you can compute e.g. homotopy groups of spheres is a computation of a combinatorial nature. These results are kind of like the poster child of HoTT but what I've always been uncomfortable about is that as far as I can see they can't compute homotopy groups of things which they can't build synthetically, and my understanding it is that it's an unsolved problem as to how to do Grassmannians synthetically (or even if it can be done?)</p>
