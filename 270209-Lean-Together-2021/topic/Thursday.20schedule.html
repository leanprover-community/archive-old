<p>Because we're all eager to hear more details about Lean 4, Leo agreed to continue with the metaprogramming slides we ran out of time for yesterday. We'll add this to the schedule at the end of today's session, at <time datetime="2021-01-07T18:00:00Z">2021-01-07T19:00:00+01:00</time> . This talk will be technical: if you don't care about metaprogramming, you're welcome to start the social time as scheduled, and the rest of us will join you a bit later.</p>
