<p>Tomorrow we have a session on "Teaching with Proof Assistants." This will be panel style. There are six presenters who will each give a short intro to how they've used proof assistants in the classroom/with undergrad students. Then we'll have an extended Q&amp;A -- you can direct questions to individual panelists or to the group as a whole.</p>

<p>The idea here is, lots of people have expressed interest using proof assistants (Lean and others) in teaching (both math and CS). We wanted to show a range of what people have done, to give inspiration.</p>

<p>My principal shareable resource is a set of Lean problem sheets: <a href="https://github.com/gihanmarasingha/mth1001_tutorial">https://github.com/gihanmarasingha/mth1001_tutorial</a>. I've started writing notes based on these Ã  la Mathematics in Lean <a href="https://github.com/gihanmarasingha/mth1001_sphinx">https://github.com/gihanmarasingha/mth1001_sphinx</a>. Very much in a draft state!</p>
<p>This was all for a first course in pure mathematics for a cohort of ~260 first-year UK mathematics undergraduates.</p>

<p>There are a lot of people teaching software foundations (semantics, hoare logic,) using Coq, Isabelle, ...  there are also a lot of people using proof assistants for teaching logic (meta theory and or proof in natural deduction or variants). I am aware of very few experiments teaching with ITP a course with significant mathematical content. I know a few experiments about using ITP in an introduction to proof course. For example: <a href="https://math.unice.fr/~ah/div/bghp.pdf">https://math.unice.fr/~ah/div/bghp.pdf</a> Hirschowitz Pottier experiment using CoqWeb (a proof by pointed web layer above Coq. I have a course about introduction to proof, and we are using Edukera. I will tell about that tomorrrow.</p>

<p>One thought I wanted to bring up: what kind of technology would help with these classes? I don't mean libraries, documentation, exercises, but more in the way of infrastructure. Better tools for installation were mentioned and that's definitely an important point.</p>

<p>I wonder if nix is a good approach with this? How hard is it to install nix (the package manager)? I've never tried installing the package manager itself (although I did use nixos for a little while)</p>

<p>If I remember correctly, Racket has multiple languages, some reduced versions specifically for teaching -- it would be cool (while also being a significant engineering task) if there were some similar interface to have teaching versions of Lean.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="233737">@Gihan Marasingha</span>, I am amazed that you could make a 260-student course work.  Even divided into 3 groups of 80 (?), it seems overwhelming.  I have found that one-on-one troubleshooting is the best way to help students (and grown mathematicians!) learn Lean, but at your scale, you must have taken a completely different approach.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="260507">@Heather Macbeth</span> other than the Lean sessions + standard maths lectures, there are fortnightly (face-to-face where desired) tutorial sessions with ~10 students per group, staffed by an army of tutors! Still, the engagement this year in tutorials was relatively low. Possibly a consequence of the pandemic.</p>

We just gave it a quick try and it seems like it could work reasonably well. The major limitation is that only one nearby person seems to be able to share their screen at the same time.</p>

<p>Btw, my dream for this is that there is nothing to install at all. There should be a script you can <code>curl | sh</code> that downloads a statically linked Nix binary, puts it and its store in a dot directory, and opens a shell that removes all of that again on exit unless you call a command for activating a permanent installation. This should actually be almost in reach <em>on Linux</em> except for a bug on Nix <code>master</code> related to local (user-namespaced) stores. There is no such option on macOS, so that would be still one less platform.</p>

<p>The teaching panel was very interesting.<br>
I'm developing a web-based ITP GUI that is (among other things) aimed at teaching, so I'd like to get in touch with potential future users.<br>
One specific question: What is the minimum amount of material that needs to be well-supported for it to be useful?<br>
(A prototype is at <a href="https://slate-prover.org/">https://slate-prover.org/</a>. You can get an idea what proof input looks like by going to e.g. <a href="https://slate-prover.org/libraries/hlm/Essentials/Numbers/Natural/Divisors%20are%20less%20or%20equal">https://slate-prover.org/libraries/hlm/Essentials/Numbers/Natural/Divisors%20are%20less%20or%20equal</a>, clicking "edit", and then clicking the + next to "no proof".)</p>

<p>What ITP is that built on right now?</p>

<p>Right now it is a custom ITP running directly in the browser, as there is a lot of interaction between the GUI and the (not-small) kernel. But I'd like to rebuild the kernel at some point, and Lean 4 looks like a good foundation for that. Especially because the logic I've implemented turned out to map comparatively well to Lean 3 (e.g. sets are handled somewhat similarly).</p>

<p>For the course I'm teaching which starts in 2 weeks, I was planning on running the two hour sessions as follows: our university forces us to use MS Teams so I was going to be there for 10 minutes giving an overview, and then I was going to send everyone to the Xena Discord, where I think it will be possible to look over people's shoulders. You can do voice chats and share screen and I am cautiously optimistic (I've run Thursday evening problem sessions at the Xena meetings and they've worked OK in the past).</p>

<p>Yes building a new open source kind of Edukera is a significant engeering task, maybe something like two man year for people experienced with this kind of dev. Edukera does have performance issues when one try bug exercises. If I remember well, this is Coq running in abstract machine compile to javascript. This is one of the reasons why It should be rewritten from scratch.  It is possible to run Lean in the Browser client side ?</p>

<p>It's not nearly as sophisticated as JSCoq though; all of the compiled olean files have to be downloaded up front.</p>

<p>For use in the classroom I think we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>no installation and running client side in the browser, otherwise it won't scale to thousand of students</li>
<li>integration with other educational systems such as moodle, for automatic grading (Edukera has this feature, it is really important when I have 400 students).</li>
<li>nice notations (2D notations for Sigma, etc...)</li>
<li>tutorial</li>
<li>not two much things to type and not two much syntax to learn:<br>
     In an Isar like language, one need to type the statements, but could prove each step by automation without learning the syntax of the tactics.<br>
     In a Tactic style language, one need to learn the tactics.<br>
 That is why I like the approach of Edukera which is a compromise between the two.<br>
As said during the talk, Edukera also has limitations: not open source and one can not create her own exercises.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, that I think the exercises for beginners learning proof should be mostly "deductive island" : proving something given some known lemmas, with enough lemmas allowing different solutions. For example, in geometry, the student should be able to use synthetic approach, or coordinate based approach.</p>
<p>Developing a whole theory, introducing relevant lemmas etc... is not for beginners, and I think it is rarely done in maths classroom.</p>

<p>I agree with all Julien just wrote and add that in my course students are <em>never</em> asked to write a definition or lemma statement. They do have to write some intermediate statements in proofs but they are very easy.</p>

<p>Going a bit out a limb here. </p>
<p>One group I interact with that is involved in teaching computer programming and had many similar problems that evolved into a well liked and used group are teachers in the U.S.A. that teach the Java <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Placement">Advanced Placement</a> course in high school.  They use <a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/default/user/login?_next=/runestone/default/index">Runteone</a> and for Java use <a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/csjava/index.html">Introduction to Programming with Java</a> as the book but the group is well organized with a website (<a href="https://www.csawesome.org/">CSAwesome</a>) and a private Google Group (<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/teaching-csawesome">Teaching CSAwesome</a>) that you can ask to join but have to convince them you are a teacher as you then get access to the answer guides and such; usually an e-mail account of <code>*.edu</code> or such works. </p>
<p>I am noting this because getting everyone on the same page for how to setup a computer, what to teach, what works, what does not work, etc. seems to me to be the same set of topics but just replacing Java for ITP.</p>
