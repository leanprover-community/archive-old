<p>Rob &amp; Patrick,  thank you once again for opportunity to speak!  I am loving the conference.

<p>I'm excited to see more model theory being done!</p>

<p>I certainly find this definition of terms easier to read than the Flypitch definition - but without having worked in detail with either, I'm not sure what the technical advantages of one over the other are.</p>

<p>Also - <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="241485">@Vaibhav Karve</span>, you mentioned avoiding <code>fin n</code> because the API is tricky. Are you aware of <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110032">@Reid Barton</span>'s finvec PR? (<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/4406">#4406</a>)</p>

<p>Perhaps a more robust <code>finvec</code> API would help - or maybe it'd just have the same nested inductive type issue as using <code>vector</code>, I'm not sure.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="302826">@Aaron Anderson</span> I had not seen that PR.  Thanks for pointing that out.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110043">@Gabriel Ebner</span> pointed out in one of the comments on that PR that <code>finvec</code> will not result in nested induction.  <span aria-label="tada" class="emoji emoji-1f389" role="img" title="tada">:tada:</span>  However, we will still need a strong API for <code>finvec</code> in order to make it work.</p>
