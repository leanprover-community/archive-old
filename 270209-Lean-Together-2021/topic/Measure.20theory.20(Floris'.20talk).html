<p>I was totally confused about a part of your talk Floris -- how could a totally random non-continuous non-measurable function from a measure space X to the norm 1 elements of a Banach space E be approximated by anything? (its norm is fine, but the function itself is pathological). That was my question. Jason Rute just suggested that I was supposed to be restricting to measurable functions though.</p>

<p>I should have been more clear: the L1-functions indeed consist of functions that are measurable + integrable.<br>
I believe we use (roughly?) the following construction to approximate any measurable + integrable function <code>f</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enumerate a dense set on your Banach space E <code>d : nat -&gt; E</code> .</li>
<li>The <code>n</code>-th approximation of your function sends <code>x</code> to the point among <code>{d 0, ... d n}</code> that is closest to <code>f x</code>.</li>
<li>Because <code>f</code> is integrable, this will converge in the L1-norm to <code>f</code> as <code>n -&gt; \infty</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I <em>think</em> this even works for functions <code>f</code> that are non-measurable (but have a finite integral). The thing you don't get in this case is that the simple functions have measurable preimages.</p>
