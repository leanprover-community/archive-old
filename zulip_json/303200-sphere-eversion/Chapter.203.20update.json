Here \"half\" means I defined data but proved nothing.  Hopefully that definition is correct (we won't know for sure until we actually prove the lemmas in that file). A basic smooth bundle  is a vector bundle over a manifold which is trivial over each coordinate chart of the manifold. This is quite a bit simpler than a general vector bundle, but it is sufficient for all bundles we care about in this project. For instance this shortcut is already used to define the tangent bundle. </p>\n<p>Assuming this definition of the 1-jet bundle, I was able to define many things that were blocking progress on Chapter 3. But I didn't prove anything. So there are currently 27 sorries in the project, all Prop, no missing data. So now is a very good time to contribute to the project.</p>",
