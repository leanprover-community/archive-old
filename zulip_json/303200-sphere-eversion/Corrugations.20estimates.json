This is pure calculus using continuity and differentiation of parametric integrals. There is a tiny beginning of proof in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/sphere-eversion/blob/master/src/local/corrugation.lean\">corrugation.lean</a>. Progress will be possible as soon as the parametric integral stuff is stated.</p>",
