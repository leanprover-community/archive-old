What I like about it is that they got the AI to look for potential counterexamples and then they <em>actually looked at the output</em> -- the graphs which the AI thought were promising -- and spotted the patterns and then went on to find the actual counterexamples themselves. They were lucky that the counterexamples had some structure.</p>",
