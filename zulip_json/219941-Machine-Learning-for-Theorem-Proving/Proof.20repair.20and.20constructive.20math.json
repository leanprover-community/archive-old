My (probably butchered) understanding is that Talia works on <a href=\"https://dependenttyp.es/pdf/repair.pdf\">proof repair</a>, the idea that we should be able automate fixing formal proofs if say the statement slightly changes or some downstream dependency changes.  Their methods of automation (if I understand correctly) exploit purely constructive proofs which don't use the axiom of choice, the law of excluded middle, function extentionality, uniqueness of identity proofs, (nor even the univalence axiom).  Now I don't know enough about this to understand the points, but I think it is an interesting discussion, since I'm sure Lean would like automated proof repair in the future, and Lean also relies heavily on some forms of classical logic (and has UIP built in).</p>",

Nonetheless, Lean 4 will also be very focused on formal verification of all the code written in Lean 4.

I think Talia's work was also focused on term proofs instead of tactic proofs (but I could be wrong).  Terminal <code>simp</code>s are one example of self-repairing tactics.  Also, I still think that ML could go a long way in this area since it is really a question of making simple fixes to a proof which are obvious to say a human (and Talia seems to agree at least in part, given their current research focus).  ML may blunt some of the constructive/classical, term-proof/tactic-proof pain, but maybe I'm being naive or overly optimistic.  (I'd be interested in Talia's thoughts on this, but I think they run in different online forum circles. <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span> )</p>",
