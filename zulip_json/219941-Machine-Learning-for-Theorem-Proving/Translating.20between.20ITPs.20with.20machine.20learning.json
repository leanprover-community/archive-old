Are there ways to get around data scarcity, such as co-training on related tasks, or pre-training the models?</li>\n<li>How would the model handle definitions which are not in the library?  For example, take the <a href=\"http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~kleing/top100/#5\">Isabelle version of the Prime Number Theorem</a>, <code>(Œªx. pi x * ln (real x) / real x) ‚á¢ 1</code> .   The prime-counting function <code>pi: nat -&gt; real</code> doesn‚Äôt exist in Lean (as far as I know), but it wouldn‚Äôt be difficult to define it.  More subtly, Lean doesn‚Äôt use the same sort of notation for convergence.  Ideally, one would not want a direct translation, but one in the Lean style.  (One idea is that one would translate not only a theorem, but all of the definitions used in that theorem, etc, but this requires a lot of thought to get right.)</li>\n<li>Would the translation be into fully elaborated Lean code or into human-style Lean source code?  Would it generate just theorem statements or whole Lean file sketches filled with <code>sorry</code>s?</li>\n<li>Would it make sense to also have a natural English mathematics as one of the languages being translated?  One could use arXiv, wikipedia, proof-wiki, etc.  The idea here is that the vocabulary of ITPs is borrowed from natural language math.  However, the danger is that this starts to get into auto-formalization which is much harder problem.</li>\n<li>How can type checking be used to improve the translations?   (It seems to me that one of TransCoder‚Äôs largest opportunities for improvement is by rewarding the agent for translations which both (1) compile, and (2) produce the same results.  Something similar can be done in theorem proving.)</li>\n<li>Since there should be many theorems which actually align perfectly between libraries, should we do this in multiple steps?  (1) Train a model to propose matching theorems between libraries, (2) have a human sort through the proposals for exact matches, (3) add those aligned examples to the training data.</li>\n<li>To make this project a reality, how much ITP engineering would have to happen and is there enough motivation to do it?  </li>\n<li>To be clear, to just naively generate proposed translations of all theorems for all pairs of ITPs would require almost no ITP engineering (assuming there is enough data to run something like TransCoder), since the theorem data already exists and we know how to extract it.  However, to check that the translations type-check, or running a neural theorem prover on the translations would require significant ITP integration, only some of which currently exists for the various ITPs?</li>\n</ul>",
