Basically, you should use whatever model seems to work best at whatever time you are living in. Right now that means transformers. Since we weren't co-training on anything and the Dodona data has natural graph structure, we also chose to augment the standard transformer with the ability to attend to the edges of the graph, but this part is not necessary.</p>",

The key problem Dodona solves (at least in principle) is that it lets you build precise, neurally-embeddable specifications for any computable goal. A network may gain 99.99% of its knowledge from arbitrarily unstructured data, and yet it could still serve as a universal oracle for Dodona as long as it sees enough Dodona problems to infer how to interpret these specifications precisely.</p>",

Would all that code get passed to the Neural network as part of the continuation?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Dodona supports tagging functions as <code>@[opaque]</code>, which means that the function should be embedded as its name rather than as its code. This feature could easily be made available in any Dodona descendent as well. However, big datastructures (as opposed to big programs) pose a serious problem. The Dodona embedder has access to runtime type information, and so a type may be marked as opaque and embedded by its name rather than as its data. But this may not be possible in other languages. For example, in the Lean4 runtime, every object is represented by a <code>lean_object</code> and there is no additional typing information. I prototyped a universal oracle for Lean4 and tried it on the tactic framework. The embeddings were astronomical, since the backtracking part of the tactic state includes the entire environment. Even after removing the environment from the backtracking tactic state, there was still quite a lot of waste, since the metavariable context was still getting embedded (which includes information about past goals that are not relevant to the current ones) and the embedding of every expression included all of its implicit arguments. Worse, there is no obvious recourse.</p>",

I think it is still very much an open problem how best to leverage ML for hard (IMO-level) mathematical problem solving. I wrote up a taxonomy of possibilities in a short idea paper for an upcoming ICLR workshop. My current thinking is to pre/co-train on everything, then rank choices in SearchT tactics based on a mix of explicit tactic-state snapshots and a (Dodona-style) view of the downstream code (but not the data). This is messy though and not worth speculating about until it comes time to try it.</p>",
