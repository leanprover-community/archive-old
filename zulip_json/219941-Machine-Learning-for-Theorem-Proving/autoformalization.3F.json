(Don't get me wrong - this sounds like a pretty fun activity - but I think a lot of it is boring and routine.) Using autoformalization tools (even imperfect ones that produce partially-correct/-accurate transcriptions) would enable formal mathematics to be done at scale, and competitively with the pace of traditional research. </p>\n<p>One way we could go about this is by creating synthetic data: from a dataset of verified proofs (which could be human-written or itself automatically generated combinatorially), use a compiler-like program to turn this into natural-language content (possibly with LaTeX added), and optionally mutate it with word-dropping, replacing words with BERT, deleting minor lemmas, etc. to simulate the non-rigorous-ness of human mathematicians. Combined with progress in machine translation, I think that autoformalization is looking more feasible than ever.</p>\n<p>As for concrete stuff I found:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05229.pdf\">Ohri &amp; Schmah 2020</a> don't use formal proofs, but they do train a system to map English LaTeX to French LaTeX.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.02636.pdf\">Wang, Brown, Kaliszyk &amp; Urban 2019</a> try training an autoformalizer to map English to Mizar.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/143744/143744.pdf\">Kaliszyk, Urban &amp; Vyskoƒçil 2015</a> train another autoformalizer to map informal LaTeX to HOL Light.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://colo12-c703.uibk.ac.at/2019/abstract/paper%2020.pdf\">Wang, Kaliszyk &amp; Urban 2012</a> propose a few experiments but do not carry out any.</li>\n</ul>",

        "content": "<p>I think auto-formalization is really key to advancing automated theorem proving and helping with library creation.  However, just as with \"automated reasoning\", there is a wide spectrum of possibilities.  I don't think that new papers in mathematics, or advanced esoteric topics will be autoformalized anytime soon.  However, it is well known by now that one can train a reasonably good ML theorem prover in your favorite logic or ITP if you have a reasonably large and diverse set of theorem statement examples (search for papers with the terms \"Reinforcement Learning\" and \"theorem proving\").  And I think our provers would do even better if we could formalize a lot of basic facts about certain areas of mathematics.  The library in Lean for example is in some sense very sparse.  Lean doesn't need (or want) to add lots of little variations of every theorem in the library, if they are easy consequences of the main theorems, but that may very well help in training mathematical proof agents.  Also, such autoformalization would be possible help to an ITP user trying to formalize a particular paper or book.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Here are some topics I would imagine come up in the space.  (It is mostly my random thoughts, but some of it is informed by what I've read or seen.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aligned or unaligned.  In machine translation this is a big topic.  It is easier to train translation if we have examples of English and French sentences which say the same thing.  How, we have more data if we just take a lot of English text and a lot of French text, and a lot of work has been done lately on unaligned machine translation.  This is not only in natural language translation, but also in translation from say Python to C++.  In formal mathematics, I think there is very little natural aligned text.  I think some of the papers you mention use synthetic examples which may help.</li>\n<li>Vocabulary.  I think one of the most difficult issues is that there is still not a lot of common mathematics in ITPs.  For example, I'm not aware of any ITP with extensive probability theory or calculus.  Even though these are part of an undergraduate curriculum, they are difficult to formalize and design notation for.  I doubt any current AI would be able to align some ideas until they are designed out in ITPs.  And these are just examples of common mathematical ideas.  Unfortunately, nearly every paper in mathematics invents its own terms (even if it is just temporary to that paper).  Alignment would be very difficult with research level papers for that reason.</li>\n<li>Mismatches in corpus sizes.  There is vastly more data on informal math than formal math and this is going to be a challenge.  Indeed, Szegedy talks a lot about this challenge in his talk.</li>\n<li>Side conditions.  This is already an issue in Lean.  For example, <code>forall n m : nat, (n - m) + n = m</code> is not technically true unless <code>n &gt;= m</code>, but is morally true.  What happens if the autoformalizer returns something like that.  Is that useful?</li>\n<li>Clean data.  If auto-formalization of raw arXiv doesn't make much progress, then I wonder if we need to step back and ask the following question.  What is the type of mathematics would we would like to autoformalize today.  IMO problems?  Textbooks?  Textbook exercises?  Made up examples just for ITP training that is easier to type out in LaTeX than a formal prover.  Can we then curate an extensive and clean dataset.  It won't be as large as arXiv, but it might be much more useful.</li>\n</ul>",

I think that the people who think that this is close are just reading mathematics papers of a completely different nature to the ones I am trying to formalise.</p>\n<p>I've seen what computers can do and right now my personal opinion (and others will have different opinions) is that it is a complete joke to think that we are anywhere near being able to get a computer to understand what a research algebraic number theorist writes in a modern paper. Even PhD students struggle to understand what an expert writes -- they leave so much out, with no indication about whether the gaps are to be filled in with a trivial calculation or an application of a standard theorem with a highly complex proof. If I were less sure about this opinion then I would be an awful lot less sure about my current program of trying to help to train humans to do this kind of work. I would <em>love</em> to be proved wrong.</p>",

It doesn't need to be too complicated and powerful. For example, I will be satisfied with a model that if it has learned a chapter of a textbook, it has the ability to auto-formalize the exercises of that chapter. I think the memory network and some pre-training language models like CodeT5 can do that. I would like to ask if there is any available dataset at present. I would also appreciate any other good suggestions! Thank you!</p>",

I don't mean to discourage you.  Nothing shocks me anymore with pre-trained transformer models (foundation models).  If you can get something working reasonably well, I would strongly encourage you to put in on arXiv, share it widely (including here), and submit it to an ML conference it (like ICLR, NeurIPS, or ICML), and submit it to non-publication workshops (like AITP).  Now as for references, the references mentioned above are all a good place to start (including that talk by Szegedy that I mention).  I have to admit that I'm not sure any of those works use pre-trained models (like CodeT5) and that might be the game changer here.  (Also, if your method is quite general purpose, you may want to also try Coq, Isabelle, and HOL-Light as those are older languages so they have more examples on the web, especially Coq I think.)</p>",
