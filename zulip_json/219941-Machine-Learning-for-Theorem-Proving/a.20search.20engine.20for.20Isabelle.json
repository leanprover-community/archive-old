For tips on how to construct effective queries, please see Section 3 of the user guide.<br>\nNote that there are 6 different methods to experiment with.</p>\n<p>SErAPIS is also a platform for conducting research in novel methods to search Isabelle collections and machine learning in Isabelle.</p>\n<p>We kindly ask that you help us with our research by providing us with feedback on the relevance of SErAPIS search results to your searches.<br>\nGiving us feedback is optional but very easy to do (see Section 4 of the user guide).</p>\n<p>Your feedback will help us:</p>\n<p>(i) build data-sets for Isabelle search and machine learning,<br>\n(ii) develop new search algorithms for Isabelle collections and;<br>\n(iii) develop machine learning methods for aiding the construction of proofs in Isabelle.</p>\n<p>All data collected is anonymised.</p>\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n<p>Yiannos Stathopoulos @Yiannos and Angeliki Koutsoukou-Argyraki.</p>",
