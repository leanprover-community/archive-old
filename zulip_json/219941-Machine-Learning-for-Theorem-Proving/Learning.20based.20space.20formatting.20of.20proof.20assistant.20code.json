        "content": "<p>Dear Lean ML community,</p>\n<p>My collaborators and I recently presented our work-in-progress on learning-based space formatting of Coq files at the Coq Workshop (see <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16743\">abstract on arXiv</a> and <a href=\"https://coq-workshop.gitlab.io/2020/slides/Coq2020_02-03-formatting-slides.pdf\">slides</a>). We used a dataset that was discussed <a href=\"#narrow/stream/219941-Machine-Learning.20for.20Theorem.20Proving/topic/Coq.20machine.20learning.20dataset.20based.20on.20MathComp.201.2E9.2E0\">elsewhere</a> on Lean's Zulip.</p>\n<p>We believe similar techniques can easily be applicable to Lean files (especially Lean 4, through its accessible ASTs). Our main limitation right now that we don't handle hierarchical formatting of proof scripts. We would welcome any feedback from the Lean ML community on this, in particular how one can define features to expose formatting/indenting based on the proof goal structure.</p>\n<p>The best idea I have right now is that one could attach a tuple or list of integers, e.g., \"(2, 3)\" or \"2 3\", to tokens inside a tactic expression that is operating on the 3rd subgoal of the 2nd subgoal. But there is likely a general way to handle this, perhaps even across proof assistants like Lean and Coq.</p>",

If I recall, you might be able to record the starting and ending positions of tactics using that.  This is more accurate but involves a bit of hacking (just the Lean, not the C++).
