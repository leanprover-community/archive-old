How one formalizes the \"Determine the least real number such and such ...\". What does \"determine\" mean?</p>\n<p>I'm suspecting that showing the set of all the number satisfying the inequality, proving it is bounded from belo, closed and taking its infimum is not sufficient. Mainly because it involves noncomputable operation infimum. But with reals it is a bit tricky to say what is computable and what not.</p>\n<p>The only way I can make sense out of it is to first define an inductive data type for expressions involving rational numbers and allowed binary and unary functions like +,-,*,/,√,... Also define a map from these expression to reals. <br>\nThe \"determine\" means, find a computable element of these expressions such that it satisfies the inequality if interpreted as a real number.</p>\n<p>What I find interesting is that the only way I can come up with formalization of it involves computability.</p>\n<p>I know very little about this topic, do people use (non)computability to formalize IMO problems?</p>",

        "content": "<p>In this particular case, you could argue that the infimum is actually a minimum, since, by homogeneity, you can restrict the computation to the <code>a, b, c</code>s on the unit sphere, a compact manifold.  Since the resulting function is differentiable, the minimum will be achieved at a point where the derivatives vanish, so the choices of <code>a, b, c</code> will be contained in a set defined by polynomial equations.  Thus, the \"infimum\" is actually an algebraic number: these should be computable!</p>\n<p>Still, I agree with you that the interpretation \"the set of <code>M</code>s is closed, non-empty and bounded below\" could be viewed as sufficient.</p>",

If such a type was not a <code>Prop</code>, the term provided by the solver must also satisfy human review as being a legitimate answer to the problem. So for \"determine the least real number\", there would be at two <code>sorry</code>s to fill in, one to be filled in with a real number (subject to human review for whether it's a legitimate answer) and one to be filled in with a proof that that real number satisfies the conditions of the problem (to be verified automatically by whether the proof type-checks).
