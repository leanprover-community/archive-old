One should just think of Lean <code>gptf</code> as just another powerful Lean tactic which is in currently in development, like <code>rw_hint</code> which won't be left in mathlib code.

I now assume the issue is that currently <code>gptf</code> depends on <code>mathlib</code> so it can't be used as a dependency inside <code>mathlib</code>, right?  So yes, we either have to move <code>gptf</code> inside <code>mathlib</code> (or a branch), or remove the dependency on <code>mathlib</code>.  I don't think the latter would be that hard.  As far as I see, we don't use any theorems in mathlib.  We just use some convince meta programming code which could be duplicated if needed.  Right?  I'm really fine with whatever approach is easiest to implement and maintain and most likely to get folks using it.</p>",
