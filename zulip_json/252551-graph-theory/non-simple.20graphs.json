        "content": "<p>Hi, coming back to the question of the typeclass hierarchy for graphs. I have been trying to prove Menger's theorem for <code>simple_graph</code> as a way to practice and learn/test the API, but  the proof I know involves tracking paths along graph contractions and that is really awkward to do on simple graphs because one has to prevent repeated vertices, so much so that I am getting really stuck (well, in addition I must be doing plenty of mistakes ...). So I would be much happier with a <code>graph</code> structure for which the arguments feel more natural. I realize there is one in the pipeline but in the meantime I am wondering about the best thing for me to do because a half-finished proof is always frustrating. I am hesitating between</p>\n<ul>\n<li>defining a <code>lazy_walk</code> that is allowed not to move, and writing the proof in terms of that (but that means no access to the <code>walk</code> API);</li>\n<li>defining a <code>graph</code> structure with just enough API for the proof to proceed (but that feels like a huge waste of time);</li>\n<li>soldiering on with <code>simple_graph</code> anyway, despite the impedance mismatch (at least that is practice ...)</li>\n<li>moving on for now <span aria-label=\"sad\" class=\"emoji emoji-2639\" role=\"img\" title=\"sad\">:sad:</span> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any estimate on the timeframe when the new graphs would be in mathlib?
