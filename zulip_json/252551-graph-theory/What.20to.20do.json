There's one thing that people aren't currently working on which would be nice to have. It's the counterexample to Hedetniemi's conjecture. Stuff has started at <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/hedetniemi\">branch#hedetniemi</a> and stalled because we need the fact that there exists graphs of arbitrary high girth and chromatic number (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girth_(graph_theory)#Girth_and_graph_coloring\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girth_(graph_theory)#Girth_and_graph_coloring</a>). You probably won't make it to the end because it's a team-sized job, but if you manage to kick the can lower down the road it would be great already. Eg, I don't think we have a definition of girth currently, and I think that what Kyle is doing currently should be enough to provide the basics.</p>",

        "content": "<p>We should have enough in mathlib itself now to define girth, if you want to try <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"270523\">@Huỳnh Trần Khanh</span>.</p>\n<p>There are two options for formalization: have the girth be a natural number, and if there are no cycles it's <code>0</code>, or match the usual definition and have the girth take values in <code>ℕ+</code>, and if there are no cycles it's infinity. I'd probably do the second, but I wanted to float the first idea in case anyone thought it wouldn't cause any problems.</p>\n<p>The hedetniemi branch uses <code>ℕ+</code> <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/hedetniemi/src/graph_theory/girth.lean\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/hedetniemi/src/graph_theory/girth.lean</a></p>\n<p>For the API, I'd suggest having a <code>girth_at_least</code> predicate like in this branch, but maybe instead <code>girth</code> could be a noncomputable function that returns the girth (rather than it being a predicate like in the branch).

I'm pretty sure I haven't proved that among the connectivity PRs.
