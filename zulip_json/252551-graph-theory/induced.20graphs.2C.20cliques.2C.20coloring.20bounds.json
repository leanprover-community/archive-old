The first is <code>simple_graph.induce</code>, which takes a <code>simple_graph V</code> and produces a <code>simple_graph s</code> by just restricting the vertex set. The second is <code>simple_graph.subgraph.induce</code>, which takes a <code>G.subgraph</code> and produces another <code>G.subgraph</code>.  They both seem useful and have different properties, similar to edge deletion.</p>\n<p>With this PR, you can express that a set <code>s</code> of vertices forms a clique by <code>G.induce s = ⊤</code>. This is harder to express using <code>simple_graph.subgraph.induce</code> without, say, introducing an additional <code>simple_graph.subgraph.is_complete</code> predicate.</p>",
