I'm happy to see some graph theory PRs coming in. But I'm not really a graph theory expert, and I don't have a good vision for what the library should look like. I also don't have the time to become an expert <span aria-label=\"wink\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f609\" role=\"img\" title=\"wink\">:wink:</span> <br>\nSo, here's my proposal for these PRs: I will try my best to review them. But it would be very useful if you would also thoroughly review each others PRs. If you approve the PR (using the github review feature), then I will see those green checkmarks, and feel a lot more comfortable.<br>\n(Of course this means that you shouldn't give that green checkmark too hastily. I will interpret it as a statement that you don't have any comments or remarks left, and are happy with the way the PR looks like.)</p>",
