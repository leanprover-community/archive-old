I tried that with the finite version and fixed a problem <code>exists_mem_of_ne_empty</code> with the <a href=\"https://github.com/b-mehta/combinatorics/blob/extras/src/ramsey.lean\">finite version</a> (see my fix using  <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/hmonroe/80b4fc7f4cefaf94d6f785f5520dcf44\">calc</a>) but could not work out how to fix <code>insert_empty_eq_singleton</code>. It would be good to get some version of your proofs into mathlib which can later be improved upon and generalized.</p>",
