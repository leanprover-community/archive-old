Let us work together to update the content in order to provide a hassle-free environment for those wishing to train on their Lean skills by completing kata on Codewars. In particular, if you find one (or more) of your authored kata on <a href=\"https://github.com/codewars/codewars.com/wiki/List-of-Lean-Kata-to-Update\">this list</a> then please upgrade your kata to 3.18.4 in your spare time if possible.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your help and attention, your effort is much appreciated <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span> </p>\n<p>P.S. Thank you to those who worked hard to make Lean run faster. According to kazk, Lean v3.18.4 is about twice as fast as Lean v3.11.x and slightly faster than Lean v3.7.x <span aria-label=\"tada\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f389\" role=\"img\" title=\"tada\">:tada:</span></p>",
