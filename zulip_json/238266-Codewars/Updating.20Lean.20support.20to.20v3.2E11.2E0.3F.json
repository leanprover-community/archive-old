I've noticed that some newcomers have <a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/5e9900b311efe00001996e26/discuss#5eaf3e629c7ebe0015d57600\">encountered issues with conflicting Lean versions between their local installation and the one used on Codewars</a>.</p>\n<p>In general, how much of an issue is it for Codewars as a training platform for Lean to use an outdated version of Lean + mathlib like v3.7.2? If a noticeable fraction of the Lean community is turned away from Codewars primarily due to the outdated setup then we could request support for the newest version (3.11.0 at the time of writing) and perhaps update our setup every month or two.</p>\n<p>When that happens, we would temporarily have support for two different versions of Lean, e.g. v3.7.2 and v3.110 (+ mathlib), though ideally we would migrate all existing content to v3.11.0 and then remove support for v3.7.2 once that is done.</p>\n<p>What do you think? Is it worth the trouble? Vote <span aria-label=\"+1\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f44d\" role=\"img\" title=\"+1\">:+1:</span> if you would like to see Lean v3.11.0 supported on Codewars (+ monthly / bi-monthly version updates) and <span aria-label=\"-1\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f44e\" role=\"img\" title=\"-1\">:-1:</span> otherwise.</p>",

In contrast, Lean has just been recently supported and we don't have nearly as much content compared to JS / Python / Java or even Haskell so we can afford to update our content regularly and drop support for older versions.</p>",
