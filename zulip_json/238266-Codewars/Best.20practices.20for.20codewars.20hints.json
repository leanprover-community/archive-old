I've really enjoyed the codewars platform so far, but I've found that I often get stuck on a codewars problem, spend a long time going through API, finally get to an incredibly messy solution, and then realize there was  a tactic or theorem in a different file that I didn't know about that made the whole process a lot easier. What should be the standard procedure for getting hints for problems? I know some platforms have a system where you can sacrifice a fraction of your total score by getting a hint. I feel like just being told \"try using this tactic\" would be very helpful on a lot of kata. There's definitely some value in slogging through the mathlib API, it just isn't always fun, and sometimes I spend a LONG time solving an unrelated subgoal that could have been resolved in one line.  I've heard various opinions about how Zulip should be used for codewars problems too. Thoughts?</p>",
