The script puts everything into <code>~/.elan/</code>.  If you use zsh, then add this to your <code>.zshenv</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">source</span> <span class=\"bp\">~/.</span><span class=\"n\">elan</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span><span class=\"n\">env</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Then</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"err\">$</span> <span class=\"n\">pip3</span> <span class=\"n\">install</span> <span class=\"c1\">--user mathlibtools</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>In emacs, do <code>M-x package-list-packages</code> and install <code>lean-mode</code> and <code>helm-lean</code>.  You do this by navigating to each entry and pressing <code>i</code>,  then pressing <code>x</code> to execute the installation.</p>\n<p>You might need to <code>M-x customize-variable lean-rootdir</code>.  Set it to <code>\"~/.elan/\"</code> (with quotes).</p>\n<p>Now when you open a <code>.lean</code> file in emacs, it should be all set, though I haven't tested much out yet beyond opening a couple files and proving a theorem.</p>\n<p>Helm lets you do <code>C-c C-d</code> to look up definitions.  <code>M-.</code> finds the definition for the symbol at the point.  <code>C-c C-b</code> shows boxes for things like <code>#check</code>.  <code>C-c C-g</code> opens up the goal window.</p>",
