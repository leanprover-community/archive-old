The main problem I've had learning the area is that a lot of the people who study homotopy type theory tend to be people interested in foundational matters and we seem to have little in common. The observation that very little of what I recognise as \"normal mathematics\" is in these provers is normally met by the counterargument that people that use them aren't really interested in that kind of mathematics. There are some fundamental big research questions about the nature of homotopy types and their relation to computation and infinity categories etc, and this is what people think about.</p>\n<p>In some sense the main difference is this. In Lean\"s dependent type theory the mental model is that a type is a set, and equality of terms of that type is equality of elements of that set. In homotopy type theory the mental model is that types are topological spaces up to homotopy, and equality of terms is interpreted as paths. My main objection to this is that if you have a topological space then it appears that it's an open problem to construct a type representing that topological space, whereas if you have a set then it's pretty easy to make a type in lean which corresponds to it. This whole thing about proofs being isomorphic is cool but is not something I want to be hung up on as an algebraic number theorist -- I don't want it to be in the way. Believe me I've seen enough problems in lean with proofs of x=x fail because if you expand out the terms it turns out that two multiplications you used somewhere deep down were not quite equal by definition and you have to apply an obvious lemma to finish the proof. For this issue to be made worse is not a place I want to go in practice. There is a whole HoTT Zulip chat which I'm sure would welcome any questions you have, but don't mention my name there ;-)</p>",
