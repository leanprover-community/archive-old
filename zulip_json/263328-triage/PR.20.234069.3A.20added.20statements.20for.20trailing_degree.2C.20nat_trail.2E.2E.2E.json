        "content": "<p>The lemmas in this PR are adaptations of the lemmas that existed at the time for the <code>leading_coefficient</code> of a polynomial, but not for the <code>trailing_coefficient</code>.  Now, with the definition of <code>reflect</code> most of these lemmas can, in theory, be proved by reducing statements about the <code>trailing_degree</code> of <code>f</code> to statements about the <code>leading_coefficient</code> of <code>reflect f</code>.  The missing ingredient is a proof that leading and trailing coefficients are exchanged by <code>reflect</code>.  An earlier proof of this fact did not use <code>dual_order</code> and did not make into mathlib.  I was not able to make the version with <code>order_dual</code> to work, so I am stuck and stopped thinking about this.</p>\n<p>The lemma that I feel should be in mathlib is the statement that the trailing degree of a product is the product of the trailing degrees (with some assumptions).  There have been many refactors, since I last checked: I doubt that this result is in mathlib, but if it is, then closing this PR would be fine for me!</p>",
