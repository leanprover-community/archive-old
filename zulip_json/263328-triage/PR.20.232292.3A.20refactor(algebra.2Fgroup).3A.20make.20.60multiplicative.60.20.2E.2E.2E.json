I am well aware that from a CS point of view giving things more than one name is a pain, and indeed I remember the struggle I had in 2018 or so to even persuade the developers of the polynomial API to even make a <code>coeff</code> function, because their argument was that it \"was already there\", it was called function evaluation.

If there are people who want to use Lean as a CAS and multiply polynomials together then making them irreducible might have consequences. But I also have this vague idea that algorithms for multiplying things together which are good for proving are totally different to the algorithms for multiplying things together which are good for computing (e.g. there are efficient ways to multiply large matrices together which beat the naive method, but the naive method is essential if you want to prove theorems) so I kind of suspect that this CAS thing is somehow a different problem -- one would want to write other functions to do this sort of thing rather than getting the provey stuff we have to compute.</p>",
