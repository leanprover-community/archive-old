The rather esoteric solution of letting elements of infinite order have order 0 looks weird to mathematicians but actually works really nicely, and this is because a conceptual way of thinking about the order of g is the kernel of the map from Z to G sending 1 to g; this kernel has a unique nonnegative generator which one could define to be the order.</p>",
