Essentially they allow you to show a functor preserves certain limits provided there are isomorphisms of the correct shape, but they don't need to be canonical. eg we have that a functor preserves binary products iff <code>is_iso (prod_comparison G X Y)</code> for all X Y, but it suffices for there to be any natural isos of the right shape, which may not be those (and in fact the isos given can be different to the \"correct\" ones). As far as I know, this result isn't particularly needed by anyone right now but I think it's pretty cool anyway. I'll update the descriptions.</p>",
