I am not an analyst so I don't really know the correct generality; I would imagine that there are people around here who do know though. I would imagine that we're getting to the point where if we come up with a definition, we might be able to integrate 1/z around the unit circle, which would be a cool and related result.</p>",

I would have no objections to you closing the issue and opening a new one which says \"we don't have (something you believe is more representative of the issue that we don't have anything like a first course in complex analysis).</p>",
