If I understand correctly this step just consists of: take all files in mathlib and list them in lexicographic order and make sure they match <code>mathlib.lean</code>. That shouldn't require building mathlib first and it would be good to get the feedback right away. Right now build times are short so it isn't a big deal, but it will get annoying later.</p>",
