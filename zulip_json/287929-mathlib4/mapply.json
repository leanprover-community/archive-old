My working knowledge is that <code>apply</code> (or <code>refine</code>) create new meta-variables and then put a partial proof-term into the goal meta-variable (please correct me if I am using the wrong words or I am misunderstanding something) and I guess is referred to as unification. What is matching?<br>\n3) <code>mapply</code> seems to have no tests and is not used anywhere in mathlib, are there any examples on what <code>mapply</code> succeeds on which <code>apply</code> cannot do. There might be the related question whether <code>mapply</code> is useful to have in the first place, but for the sake of tactics porting this is of course not relevant.</p>",
