Ideally, this involves pointing the tool at a mathlib4 file, and a mathlib3port file, and making sure that all mathlib3 decl names are represented in both sets. That means reading in the decls from a module,  un-aligning the identifier, and checking the difference of sets. I'm trying to learn the metaprogramming to make this possible. Is <code>Std.Tactic.Lint.Frontend</code> and <code>Mathlib.Mathport.Rename</code> the places to look for inspiration?</p>",
