I have paid 0 attention to the mathlib port (and not much attention to Lean 4) until two days ago when it was announced that we could start manually porting files, something which I'm genuinely excited by, so now I'm on the learning curve. Does this mean that something is not \"aligned\" correctly in the porting program? Should this  be fixed? Most (but not all) occurrences of the <code>to_bool -&gt; toBool</code> translation \"error\" take place in the file I'm manually porting, so I can just change these things myself, unless someone tells me that <code>ToBool</code> is the new <code>Decidable</code> (as I say, I don't really get what ToBool is all about). Sorry for the basic questions, porting files is getting me up to speed quickly but I am trying to find my feet.</p>",

There are four kinds of (mis)alignments you can have:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A defeq match - lean 3 def/theorem <code>X</code> is defeq to lean 4 def/theorem <code>Y</code></li>\n<li>The value is  a mismatch but the type of lean 3 <code>X</code> (after translation) is defeq to lean 4 <code>Y</code></li>\n<li>The types are not defeq but for reasons like a change in the order of implicit arguments, which usually doesn't matter</li>\n<li><code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are completely different definitions, although they may share the same name (after translation)</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are in case 1, mathport will automatically align the definitions if <code>X = Y</code>, and otherwise you need to add <code>#align X Y</code> to get mathport to translate one to the other.</li>\n<li>In case 2/3/4, mathport would previously rename <code>X</code> to <code>Yₓ</code> if it wanted to use the name <code>Y</code> but it was already taken.</li>\n<li>After the refactor, mathport will align <code>X</code> to <code>Y</code> in case 2, and will align <code>X</code> to <code>Y</code> with a warning in cases 3 and 4</li>\n<li>In case 2, you should do the same as case 1: if <code>X = Y</code> you don't have to do anything, otherwise you should add <code>#align X Y</code></li>\n<li>In case 3, you should use <code>#align X Yₓ</code>. The <code>ₓ</code> has a special meaning now: it will be stripped when printing the lean 4 file, so behind the scenes lean will still think of it as a different definition but re-elaborating the lean 4 file will fix the argument order mismatch and use definition <code>Y</code> instead of <code>Yₓ</code>.</li>\n<li>In case 4, you should use <code>#align X Y'</code>. The <code>'</code> is not a special character here, it just means we're going to make a separate definition and avoid the collision. This is the situation with <code>toBool</code> - that's an unrelated definition so we should name any theorems something else to avoid collisions.</li>\n</ul>",
