The linter then complains that the second <code>&lt;;&gt;</code> should be replaced by a <code>;</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">cases</span> <span class=\"n\">h</span> <span class=\"bp\">&lt;;&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">simp_all</span>\n<span class=\"n\">rfl</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I don't think that's an improvement.  The intention here is to clean up all left over goals from <code>simp</code> using <code>rfl</code>, no matter whether there's one or two.  The proof shouldn't break if simp suddenly proves more or less.</p>",
