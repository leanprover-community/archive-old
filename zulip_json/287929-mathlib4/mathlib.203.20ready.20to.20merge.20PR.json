Is the idea that I wait until the mathlib4 PR to be merged before I mark the mathlib3 PR as ready for review? Or have I already made an error by making the PR early?</p>",

I think it may be best if we don't treat this as part of the job for each separate file, but rather something we can do in bulk, as in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/17314\">#17314</a>.</p>\n<p>Recall that <code>scripts/port_status.py</code> now has a section in the output that list all files that are marked as <code>Yes</code> in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/wiki/mathlib4-port-status\">#port-status</a>, but that don't have synchronization warnings in mathlib. Thus it's easy to do a single sweep to catch up.</p>",
