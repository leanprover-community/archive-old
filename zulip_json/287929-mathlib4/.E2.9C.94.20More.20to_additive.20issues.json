When I added the <code>to_additive</code> conversion, I also added a dictionary entry to <code>to_additive</code> to convert <code>regular</code> to <code>add_regular</code> and the <code>left/right</code> variants.  I cannot see now how to do a similar change for the mathlib4 version of <code>to_additive</code>, but hopefully this explains why the attribute does not find the right name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just pushed that change to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"560559\">@Richard Osborn</span>'s <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/758\">mathlib4#758</a> :)</p>",
