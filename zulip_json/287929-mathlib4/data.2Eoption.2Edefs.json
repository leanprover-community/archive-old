In some sense this isn't really blocked --- it just means someone needs to do that file first, so I'm not sure it makes sense to change the status away from <code>No</code> in this case.</p>\n<p>In any case, I did that file as <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/485\">mathlib4#485</a>, as an example that we can port stuff from Lean3 as well as mathlib3. There is a <code>lean3port</code> repository parallel to the <code>mathlib3port</code> repository, for exactly this purpose.</p>",
