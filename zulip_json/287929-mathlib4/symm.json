The simplest kind is called a \"tag attribute\", which is basically a marker on certain definitions: are you tagged or not. It is good for a lot of things like <code>@[inline]</code>, <code>@[reducible]</code>, <code>@[instance]</code>. One nice thing about tag attributes is that they have zero start-up cost - you just look in the file with the definition and see if it's tagged - but that means that they can only be tagged from the same file, since if you can tag a declaration from anywhere then either you have to look everywhere for tags or you have to spend some start up time on aggregating all the tags that have been placed on anything.</p>",
