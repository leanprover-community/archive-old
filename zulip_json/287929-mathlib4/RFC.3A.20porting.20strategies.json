        "content": "<p>As many of you know, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110049\">@Mario Carneiro</span> and I have been working on automated porting tools. The two main tools are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>binport: produces lean4 <code>.olean</code> files from lean3 <code>.tlean</code> files</li>\n<li>synport: produces lean4 <code>.lean</code> files from lean3 <code>.ast.json</code> files, that look great but will not elaborate/type-check in general</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are starting to think about both how best to connect them and how best to structure the overall porting effort. There are many possible strategies, for example:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\"top-down\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>produce <code>.olean</code> files from binport</li>\n<li>working backwards from the leaves:<ul>\n<li>produce non-working <code>.lean</code> file from synport that imports the previous binported files</li>\n<li>tweak it manually so it elaborates</li>\n<li>replace the binport <code>.olean</code> with the new <code>.lean</code> file</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"bottom-up\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>start from the beginning (as in Mathlib4 repo currently)</li>\n<li>in dependency order:<ul>\n<li>produce non-working <code>.lean</code> file from synport that imports only working <code>.lean</code> files</li>\n<li>tweak it manually so it elaborates</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"parallel\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>produce <code>.olean</code> files from binport</li>\n<li>stage 1: in parallel,<ul>\n<li>produce non-working <code>.lean</code> file from synport that imports the previous <em>binported</em> files</li>\n<li>tweak it manually so it elaborates</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>stage 2: in parallel,<ul>\n<li>replace the binportted <code>.oleans</code> with the working <code>.lean</code> files, and propagate the changes forward as necessary</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"hybrid\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>somehow interleave manual + binport, and introduce new commands that add new rules/alignments to binport</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>All strategies have \"-sorry\" variants, where nontrivial proofs are <code>sorry</code>ed out until the final, parallel stage. Microsoft is prepared to run <strong>a lot</strong> of proof search to fill in these gaps. It might not be all that hard, since we have the original tactic scripts and the binported kernel terms, and we can mine a lot of useful hints from both.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are also opportunities to use binport to help generate better <code>.lean</code> files. For example, <code>binport</code> can be used to delaborate defs/theorem statements to guarantee roundtripping. The new delaborator (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/575\">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/575</a>) has a very high roundtrip success rate while staying concise in general. However, this approach is complicated by the fact that the binported terms won't in general be exactly def-eq to the terms desired in the <code>.lean</code> file. Some things will delab in undesirable ways, e.g. definitions compiled by lean3's equation compiler.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It is also not clear how to structure the repositories, and this depends on which strategy is adopted. For example, all approaches require synport to depend on binport (for resolving/translating names), automatic proof-patching must depend on <code>Mathlib/Tactic</code>, and the hybrid approach requires Mathlib4 and binport to be mutually dependent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We can gather more empirical information before we make any big decisions. For example, for simple binport-enhanced synport, how many squigglies are there outside of proofs? When using the binported <code>.olean</code>s, how problematic are the \"weird\" binport relics (e.g. definitions compiled with lean3's equation compiler)?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

We can't change the parts we've already ported or this will mess up the porting tools.  No matter whether we do top-down or bottom-up, we'll need to essentially freeze mathlib3 when we seriously start the port.  (Or, phrased differently, manually port all PRs made after the flag day.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Suppose we do top-down. Once doing new things in lean4 with binported oleans is almost as easy as doing new things in lean3, we could define a border: new files go in Mathlib4, old files are changed in lean3 and only when absolutely necessary. Binport would be re-run when this happens. Every successful top-down lean4 <code>.lean</code> file generated (by synport + automation + delab + humans) would shift the border.</p>",

Almost every current significant contributer to mathlib started contributing at a time when it was perfectly clear that Lean 4 was coming and that porting mathlib would be a huge task.
