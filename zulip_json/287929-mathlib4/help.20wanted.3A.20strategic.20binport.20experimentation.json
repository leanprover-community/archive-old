        "content": "<p>I think the binport oleans have become usable enough that power users could help a lot by starting to (strategically) experiment with them. The goal right now is to discover, isolate, and categorize issues efficiently. Here are some concrete questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What <code>simp</code> calls break in Lean4 due to the discrimination tree indexing? Are there a few simple rules we could add to Binport to insert <code>no_index</code> annotations that would address the problems?</li>\n<li>Same question for typeclass synthesis.</li>\n<li>Are there <code>simp</code> or typeclass synthesis calls that are failing unexpectedly for reasons besides indexing?</li>\n<li>Post-facto <code>reducible</code> toggling is ignored, and all <code>irreducible</code> annotations are currently ignored as well. Are either of these causing serious issues behind the scenes?</li>\n<li>For things that do already work in Lean4, are there any significant performance regressions compared to Lean3?</li>\n<li>Are there any other issues that are not even on our radar yet?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notable differences between Binport and Mathlib3:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Binport automatically translates names to Lean4 style, adding <code>'</code>s as necessary on non-def-eq clashes. The command <code>#lookup3 &lt;ident&gt;</code> prints the new Lean4 name. It is usually (but not always) what you would expect.</li>\n<li>Binport expands all coercions, just as Lean4 does but even more aggressively. It also replaces old coercion instances (e.g. <code>has_coe_to_fun</code>) with new ones (e.g. <code>CoeFun</code>).</li>\n<li>All numerals (i.e. <code>zero</code>/<code>one</code>/<code>bit0</code>/<code>bit1</code> terms) are wrapped with <code>OfNat</code> but otherwise unchanged.</li>\n<li>As mentioned above, post-facto <code>reducible</code> toggling is ignored, and all <code>irreducible</code> annotations are currently ignored as well.</li>\n<li>As of now, <code>nat.le</code> is not aligned to Lean4's <code>Nat.le</code>, which causes subtle headaches when working with natural numbers.</li>\n<li><code>foldl</code> notations are not yet auto-ported</li>\n<li>Many small changes in unification and other core algorithms may cause various things to fail or slow down for subtle reasons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Logistics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I regularly upload a <code>tar.gz</code> file to <a href=\"https://github.com/dselsam/mathport/releases/tag/v0.0.0.0\">https://github.com/dselsam/mathport/releases/tag/v0.0.0.0</a> that, when extracted, produces the folder <code>Lib4</code>.</li>\n<li><code>import Mathlib</code> or <code>import Mathlib.Data.Real.Pi</code> will work if you set LEAN_PATH=&lt;path-to-lean4-lib&gt;:&lt;path-to-Lib4&gt;.</li>\n<li>In general, the binport <code>.olean</code>s should work with either <code>master</code> or <code>nightly</code>. Most commits to lean4 do not break compatibility.</li>\n<li>Obviously, it would be great to have CI for this and a leanpkg-friendly way of using them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For every Binported olean file <code>Foo.olean</code>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110049\">@Mario Carneiro</span>'s Synport produces <code>FooSyn.lean</code> with the best-effort syntactic port, which is name-translation-aware and already (syntactically) translates most declarations well. If you are experimenting with theorem <code>foo</code> in file <code>Foo.olean</code>, you may find it a useful starting point to copy-paste the decl from <code>FooSyn.lean</code> into a new file that imports <code>Foo</code>.</li>\n<li>Another approach is to just call <code>#check</code> on the imported theorem and copy-paste the result, factoring out arguments into variables as desired. Note: the Lean4 default pretty-printer is pretty good at concise roundtripping.</li>\n</ul>",
