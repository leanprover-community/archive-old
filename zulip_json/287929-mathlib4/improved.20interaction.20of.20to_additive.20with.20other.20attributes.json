It fixes issues <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/950\">mathlib4#950</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/953\">mathlib4#953</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/1149\">mathlib4#1149</a>.<br>\nOne major notational change is that when using <code>to_additive</code> with any other attributes (that should be on both the multiplicative and additive declaration) you have to use <code>@[to_additive (attr := ...)]</code> from now on, so e.g. </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">@[to_additive (attr := simp)]</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">@[to_additive (attr := simp, norm_cast)]</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">@[to_additive (attr := simps apply symm_apply)]</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">@[to_additive (attr := local simp 500)]</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Ideally mathport also starts using this syntax (<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110049\">@Mario Carneiro</span>). Note that in Lean 3 most other attributes come before <code>to_additive</code> but <code>simps</code> comes after it. After this PR is merged all of them should be in the <code>attr</code> field.</p>",
