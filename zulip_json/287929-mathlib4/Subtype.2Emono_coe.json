Currently it is <code>Monotone ((↑) : Subtype t → α)</code>. This caused a <code>rw</code> failure somewhere when porting. Because of import issues, this cannot be changed in <code>Order.Monotone.Basic</code> (<code>Data.Set.Basic</code> imports it and this is where the coe to Type is defined). I suggest moving this and the <code>StrictMono</code> version to <code>Data.Set.Basic</code>.</p>",
