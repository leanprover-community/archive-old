I even did this sometimes if the environment changed in the meantime, as long as the particular information that I was accessing didn't change. </p>\n<p>I think this is inefficient in Lean 4, since referring to an earlier environment than the current one means that the environment couldn't be destructively updated, and has to be duplicated. Is that correct, and should we avoid that? Does that mean that examples like these are inefficient?</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">Lean</span>\n\n<span class=\"kn\">open</span> <span class=\"n\">Lean</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">example</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">nm</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">Name</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">CoreM</span> <span class=\"n\">Unit</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"k\">do</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"n\">env</span> <span class=\"bp\">←</span> <span class=\"n\">getEnv</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">setEnv</span> <span class=\"n\">_</span> <span class=\"c\">/-</span><span class=\"cm\"> something that modifies the environment a bit -/</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">isStructure</span> <span class=\"n\">env</span> <span class=\"n\">nm</span> <span class=\"k\">then</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">_</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">example</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">nms</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">List</span> <span class=\"n\">Name</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">CoreM</span> <span class=\"n\">Unit</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"k\">do</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"n\">env</span> <span class=\"bp\">←</span> <span class=\"n\">getEnv</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">nms.forM</span> <span class=\"k\">fun</span> <span class=\"n\">nm</span> <span class=\"bp\">=&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">isStructure</span> <span class=\"n\">env</span> <span class=\"n\">nm</span> <span class=\"k\">then</span>\n      <span class=\"n\">modifyEnv</span> <span class=\"n\">_</span> <span class=\"c\">/-</span><span class=\"cm\"> something that modifies the environment a bit -/</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">else</span>\n      <span class=\"n\">pure</span> <span class=\"o\">()</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>We can avoid this by doing something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">example</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">nm</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">Name</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">CoreM</span> <span class=\"n\">Unit</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"k\">do</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">setEnv</span> <span class=\"n\">_</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">isStructure</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"bp\">←</span> <span class=\"n\">getEnv</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"n\">nm</span> <span class=\"k\">then</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">_</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">example</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">nms</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">List</span> <span class=\"n\">Name</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">CoreM</span> <span class=\"n\">Unit</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"k\">do</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">nms.forM</span> <span class=\"k\">fun</span> <span class=\"n\">nm</span> <span class=\"bp\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"k\">do</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">isStructure</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"bp\">←</span> <span class=\"n\">getEnv</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"n\">nm</span> <span class=\"k\">then</span>\n      <span class=\"n\">modifyEnv</span> <span class=\"n\">_</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">else</span>\n      <span class=\"n\">pure</span> <span class=\"o\">()</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">return</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Is this worth worrying about, or will the changes in performance be negligible?
