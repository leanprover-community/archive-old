In Lean 3, the fields <code>max</code> and <code>min</code> of a <code>linear_order</code> are auto-filled if none is provided, but that doesn't seem possible in Lean 4 (note: one cannot use <code>fun a b =&gt; if a â‰¤ b then a else b</code> for <code>min</code> because the <code>ite</code> requires a decidability assumption on the proposition, and this decidability is itself implemented in the <code>LinearOrder</code> structure. Of course, you could provide the decidable instance ahead of time, but this seems not preferable. See also <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/783\">mathlib4#783</a></p>",
