The mathport issue is that the file <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib3port/blob/be00a566e10716f5095681f61610cd7a35e2b761/Mathbin/Order/GaloisConnection.lean\">Order/GaloisConnection</a> in mathlib3port is still full of <code>supr</code>and <code>infi</code> at this time, despite the fact that mathlib4 has had <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/master/Mathlib/Order/CompleteLattice.lean#L84\">relevant align</a> for a while.</p>",
