Furthermore am I right in thinking that it's not even possible to make the complete mathlib4 PR until after the mathlib3 PR is merged, because we need a commit number and mathlib3 squash-merges stuff? I was just going through <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3cKk3ld\">#queue4</a> and I found a couple of mathlib4 PRs with a corresponding unmerged mathlib3 PR.</p>",
