I have installed both but the error has not changed. <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/stream/270676-lean4/topic/issues.20with.20.22import.22.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/stream/270676-lean4/topic/issues.20with.20.22import.22.html</a> This post made me think that this statement has not been ported over to lean 4 yet. Is this the case or am I missing something?
