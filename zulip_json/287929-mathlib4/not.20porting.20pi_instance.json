So I think we should move the pi instance for <code>AddMonoidWithOne</code> to <code>Algebra.Group.Pi</code> and add an import from <code>Data.Nat.Cast.Defs</code> there.

I've been thinking about how to make it more well-rooted in mathematical practice. Given this discussion, maybe it would be better to eventually just make a wholly new tactic called e.g. <code>defined_pointwise</code> which <em>only</em> does what mathematicians regard as a pointwise definition, and nothing else. (This would, I figure, be after the port, and in this scenario we'd port without <code>pi_instance</code>.) This might then make it easier to trust that things are definitionally equal? I'm not sure though, since I'm not sure what actually causes the definitional equality problem referred to here.</li>\n<li>Using <code>pi_instance</code> with the ported <code>refine_struct</code> functionality would still allow people to construct <code>{ Pi.group with &lt;...&gt; }</code> before using <code>pi_instance</code> to solve the unspecified fields. (Just wanted to make sure that was clear, since I'm still not totally clear on the problem.)</li>\n<li>If I instead port <code>pi_instance</code> as planned, and stay faithful to what's written in mathlib3, it would depend on the <code>refine_struct</code> functionality being added to core, which would mean we'd be waiting on that. It might help the port to say \"just do it manually\"? (Though, there miiiight be a workaround if people want <code>pi_instance</code> ASAP—I'm not totally sure, but I could think about it.)</li>\n</ol>",
