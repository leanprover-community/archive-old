The main dependency on this file is a <code>has_repr</code> for multisets which uses the definition of <code>le</code> as well as some difficult to prove properties of <code>le</code> to show the <code>repr</code> is well defined on the quotient. There are some other <code>repr</code>s that depend on this as well. There are three solutions to this. We could move <code>le</code> to <code>Data.String.Defs</code> and make the repr instane a <code>meta</code> instance, we could move the <code>repr</code>s to seperate files or we could wait until <code>Data.String.Basic</code> is ported before porting <code>Data.Multiset.Sort</code>.</p>\n<p>/poll What should we do?<br>\nMove has_repr instance into seperate files<br>\nMove le into string.defs and make the instances meta<br>\nPort Data.String.Basic before doing anything else<br>\nSomething else</p>",
