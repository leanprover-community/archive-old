One of Yael's PRs was only a few lines long but I had to carefully look at both the mathlib3 and mathlib4 source files (not just the changed lines) to make sure that some apparently-different variables changes were in fact the same, and one much larger PR had got \"de-synced\" the way sometimes happens in github (it's diffing a lemma against the lemma two below the one that it should be comparing it with etc) and this made it much harder than expected, but it certainly wasn't impossible, it was just time-consuming.

The theory suggested in the porting meeting was that the mathport output should just be a bunch of #print statements and then the mathlib4 PR, but the reality was that it was full of definitions of instances and protected theorems and huge error messages saying that things weren't aligned. </p>\n<p>To give a concrete example, take a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/1411\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/1411</a> matching <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/18086\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/18086</a> . That's a very short PR and it was not that hard to verify from the diffs that the two PRs did the same thing (although it wasn't entirely trivial because the diffs differ with variable usage). However now take a look at what mathlib3port is saying: <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib3port/blob/master/Mathbin/Algebra/SmulWithZero.lean\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib3port/blob/master/Mathbin/Algebra/SmulWithZero.lean</a> . I would far rather be checking the diffs than looking at that.</p>\n<p>The other example I alluded to earlier is <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/1439\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/1439</a> , with parallel mathlib3 PR <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/18081\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/18081</a>, merged, and which changed 12 files, three of which had been ported. Github kindly kept the ordering of the files so comparing the diffs wasn't that bad, but there were a lot of changes in the three ported files. Take a look at the first change in the first (according to github) file which was already ported: that was Algebra.Group.WithOne.Defs . The first change is to add an <code>id $</code> to a structure field, presumably because something broke in the refactor in mathlib3, but the analogous thing didn't break in mathlib4 so there is no change at all. Note that the instance shows up in the mathlib3port file <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib3port/blob/master/Mathbin/Algebra/Group/WithOne/Defs.lean\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib3port/blob/master/Mathbin/Algebra/Group/WithOne/Defs.lean</a> anyway because every single instance shows up.</p>\n<p>I am not sure that we have a good answer for how to review these paired PRs other than by manually trawling through the diffs, and I think that these two case studies firmly prove my point right now.</p>",
