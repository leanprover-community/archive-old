However, the natural index is <code>Nat</code> (which is why they are called the natural numbers -- they are the numbers used naturally for counting/ordering). The natural numbers themselves can also be 1-indexed, but as they are not in Lean, the natural base point is 0 (in my view).</p>",

The distinction I am making is one abstraction of a pair is that of composite with two elements: a left and a right (e.g., a pair of shoes or gloves). Unlike a fully unordered pair (i.e., a set/multiset of length 2), it has distinguish elements, but unlike a fully ordered pair (i.e., a list of length 2), it is not numerically ordered (i.e., it could be ordered from left to right or right to left). Essentially, such a pair is a special case of a key-value map of length 2 (with keys left and right) as opposed to being a simple ordered list of length 2. I am then asserting that such an abstraction is closer to that of <code>Prod</code> (and <code>PProd</code>, <code>And</code>, etc.) than the ordered pair / list of length 2 interpretation. This is also more true for the type itself than the tuple syntax (i.e., <code>(x,y)</code> or <code>(x,y,z)</code>) for constructing values of the type (which is more akin to the list interpretation).</p>",
