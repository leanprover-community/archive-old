We know its purpose in advance.</p>\n<p>So the thought is: what if we added a(n essentially boolean) parameter to <code>Result</code> and <code>NormNumExt</code> to keep track of which kind of thing they’re doing? This would make the code easier to handle since we could keep the two cases separate. <code>.isRat</code> etc. would construct values of <code>Result .num e</code>, whereas e.g. <code>.isLe</code> (or however exactly we did it) would construct values of <code>Result .prop e</code>. That should mean we wouldn’t be matching on constructors in extension code that didn’t make sense to match on. We’d also know e.g. whether it made sense to extract a literal from a <code>Result</code> based on the type (though I guess that’s not too much of an issue since we work in <code>Option</code> and can have things just fail, but still).</p>\n<p>This might mean maintaining two discrimination trees, one for <code>NormNumExt .prop</code> and one for <code>NormNumExt .num</code>—not sure. <code>derive</code> would get an extra argument like this as well, saying whether it should try to derive a number or a prop. (We’d need to infer the kind of result we wanted from the expression at the beginning of the outermost norm_num process, but it’s easy to test an expression for <code>Prop</code>hood, iirc?)</p>\n<p>I think it would keep the code cleaner, but what I don’t know is whether it would be good for performance. Keeping the two discrimination trees separate might be good for performance, or it could be negligible; likewise for matching on less constructors and the opposite for having more arguments in Result.</p>\n<p>Giving <code>norm_num</code> the ability to handle <code>Prop</code>s will mean refactoring/updating code in one place or another, and this is the least annoying way I can think of—it lets us leave basically all of our number-handling code as-is at the cost of a little change to the infrastructure. Plus we get useful information in the type.</p>\n<p>If this sounds good lmk and I’ll have fun implementing it!</p>",

We can't have 1/2 ≤ 0, otherwise 0 ≤ -1/2 and multiplying by 2 gets us 0 ≤ -1—not allowed since the ring is nontrivial.
