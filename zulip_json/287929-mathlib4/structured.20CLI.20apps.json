However, <code>runLinter</code> is compiled to a binary when we call <code>lake build</code>. So I had the idea of structuring such sources in a <code>CliApps</code> folder and then making separate <code>lean_exe</code> configs for them, similar to what we have for <code>Cache</code>.</p>\n<p><code>Cache</code>, then, would be placed there as well. And <code>runLinter.lean</code> would be renamed to <code>Linter.lean</code>, whose binary call would be <code>lake exe linter</code>.</p>\n<p>Another advantage is that the linter wouldn't be compiled for no reason when users call <code>lake build</code>.</p>\n<p>This is not a radical change, but would allow a more organic way of mathlib4 having its own CLI apps. What do you think?</p>",
