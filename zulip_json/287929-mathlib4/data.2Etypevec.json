I think it's due to the fact that we have to deal with type equalities in various places and I think there's plenty of defeq abuse going on in the mathlib3 side which is causing stuff to fail arbitrarily in mathlib4. I don't think this is actually an important file, which is why I've let it sit for a while, but at this point it would just be nice to get it done.</p>",
