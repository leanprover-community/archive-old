There's a PR open at <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/749\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/749</a> that depends on this, and ports the first half dozen or so files, along with the <code>@[reassoc]</code> attribute (which is where these meta functions are used).</p>",
