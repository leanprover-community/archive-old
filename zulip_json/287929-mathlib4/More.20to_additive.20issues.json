I can fix most of the problems by giving an explicit name for the additive version of <code>IsLeftRegular</code> and <code>IsRightRegular</code>, but roughly 9 theorems still fail. Should those be duplicated manually for now or is there an easy fix to <code>to_additive</code>? I'm not really sure how to debug such things.</p>",

When I added the <code>to_additive</code> conversion, I also added a dictionary entry to <code>to_additive</code> to convert <code>regular</code> to <code>add_regular</code> and the <code>left/right</code> variants.  I cannot see now how to do a similar change for the mathlib4 version of <code>to_additive</code>, but hopefully this explains why the attribute does not find the right name.</p>",
