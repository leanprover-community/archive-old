In <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/issues/8\">mathlib4#8</a> I port the core Lean 3 file <code>init.data.set</code>, which contains some very basic set stuff (even more basic than mathlib's data.set.basic). I also add a <code>Mem</code> notation class. </p>\n<p>I then wanted to get <code>Data.List.Basic</code> using my new <code>Mem</code> notation, so I added <code>import Mathlib.Mem</code> (the notation class) and tried to change <code>infix:50 \" ∈ \" =&gt; mem</code> to <code>instance : Mem α (List α) := ⟨List.mem⟩</code> but then all the proofs break, because <code>simp</code> doesn't know to unfold something. I suspect there is an easy way to fix this but I couldn't figure it out.</p>",
