        "content": "<p>Currently, <code>Mathlib.Mathport.Syntax</code> has an implementation of the <code>localized</code> command, and mathport does in fact produce <code>localized</code> applications when translating <code>localized</code> commands: <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib3port/blob/master/Mathbin/Algebra/DualNumber.lean#L50-L54\">example</a>. However,  <code>Mathlib.Mathport.Syntax</code> is not intended to be imported by mathlib4, and in most cases we want to rewrite it to use something else. So what should we do about this command? Options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Move <code>localized</code> into its own file and start importing it in mathlib4. This amounts to making it an official bit of syntax.</li>\n<li>Change mathport to produce the code that <code>localized</code> expands to, i.e. using  <code>with_weak_namespace</code> around a <code>scoped</code> syntax. This is what we should do if we are deprecating it.</li>\n<li>Change mathport to just use scoped syntax without the namespace. This is closest to the code we would like people to write instead, but it is sometimes wrong if we are not in the right namespace.</li>\n<li>Refactor mathlib3 to use the current namespace as the \"locale\" instead of taking it as an argument. This will make option (3) a more correct course of action.</li>\n</ol>",
