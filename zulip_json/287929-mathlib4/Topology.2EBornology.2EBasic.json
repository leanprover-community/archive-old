In Lean 3, this was handled with the <code>[]</code> syntax (see <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/bornology\">docs#bornology</a>). In Lean 4, this notation is not supported. For non-data-carrying fields, we can handle this with the technique in <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Countable#doc\">docs4#Countable</a> (versus <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/countable\">docs#countable</a>) as described in <a href=\"#narrow/stream/287929-mathlib4/topic/Infer.20kinds.20are.20unsupported\">this thread</a>, but for data-carrying fields this \"duplication\" trick seems like a bad idea (because of <code>@[ext]</code> or <code>@[simps]</code> lemmas at the very least). Suggestions or pushes welcome.</p>",
