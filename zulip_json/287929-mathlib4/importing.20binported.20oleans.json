It largely works, and means that you can import mathlib3 content into Lean 4 (as long as you don't expect to have source files!) This is what lets us do things like:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">Mathbin</span>\n\n<span class=\"bp\">#</span><span class=\"n\">lookup3</span> <span class=\"n\">algebraic_geometry.Scheme</span>\n<span class=\"k\">#check</span> <span class=\"n\">AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Should this still be possible? I haven't been able to get it to work.</p>",
