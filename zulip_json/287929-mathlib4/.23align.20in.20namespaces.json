If I'm in lean 4 namespace <code>Foo</code> corresponding to lean 3 namespace <code>foo</code>, and foo/Foo are being correctly aligned, and I define lean 4 <code>Bar</code> which needs to be aligned to lean 3 <code>baz</code> then can I just <code>#align baz Bar</code> or do I need to <code>#align foo.baz Foo.bar</code>?</p>",
