For example, make a list of files (and/or sections of files) that would be noteworthy to port and have people comment what things they would like to take the reigns on.</p>\n<p>It might be a nice way to get the community more into working with Lean 4 if there were some concrete goals to complete (that also have the reward of benefiting the community).
