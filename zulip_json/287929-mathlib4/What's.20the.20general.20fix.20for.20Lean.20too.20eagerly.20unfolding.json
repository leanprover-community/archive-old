The issue strikes <code>mem_fix_iff</code> where a <code>simp</code> isn't hitting places it's supposed to hit because Lean 4 isn't recognizing the current state as pretty printable, and I have the same issue trying to fix <code>prodMap_comp_comp</code>, <code>fixInduction'_stop</code>, <code>ixInduction'_fwd </code></p>\n<p>(I'm also seeing strange errors in <code>generalize_proofs</code> for <code>fixInduction</code> and <code>fix_induction_spec</code> with <code>unknown free variable '_uniq.71572'</code></p>\n<p>Any help for this PR is appreciated -- I've fixed a bunch here, but I'm staring at the rest crosseyed.</p>",
