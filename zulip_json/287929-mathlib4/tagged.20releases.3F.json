This is so <code>lakefile.lean</code> in a course repository can point to tagged versions to ensure compatibility.</p>\n<p>Specifically, what would be nice is for coordinated labels for <code>mathlib</code>, <code>Std</code>, <code>Qq</code>, <code>docgen4</code> and <code>aesop</code> so that any project that uses versions with the same tags and has the same lean-toolchain as the tagged mathlib should have compatible dependencies. </p>\n<p>My main concern is that students will run <code>lake update</code> and break their clones.  I can point to specific commits in the lakefile but that is more fiddly.</p>",
