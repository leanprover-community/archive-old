This was back in the days when I was convinced that Lean could help weak students to learn how to do e.g. basic questions about equivalence relations (and before I realised that getting weak students to not only learn the course but also learn a hard programming language was really not a viable way to proceed). Athina went on to write up a paper with Paola Iannone about the experience, and it was published last week.</p>",
