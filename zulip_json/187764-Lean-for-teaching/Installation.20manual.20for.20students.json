It makes it painful to incorporate useful facts (like most proofs for int) from either std4 or mathlib4 since those run on nightly but it avoids any breakage of existing code in core.  I assume they will not be installing it on their own machines so provide container config files. We started with just GitPod but now each repository has GitPod and Codespaces config files.  Students seem to generally Codespaces because it is a single click away from the GitHub repository by default.
