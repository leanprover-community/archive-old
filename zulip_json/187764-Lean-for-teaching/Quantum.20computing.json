I'll give an introductory class on quantum computing this Fall. It is a graduate class, so there's some room open for experiments. One of my colleagues in CS used ACL2 to prove that a quantum algorithm is correct, but aside from that line of work I'm not aware of any other use of formalization in the field.</p>",
