In particular I did not teach the students any Lean syntax or give them any Lean problems. My main point was that the infoview is a way to follow what is going on in a proof, since this was one of their first exposures to proofs. The students participated, however, by suggesting proof steps in natural language, which I then \"translated\" to Lean on the spot (at least if they were reasonable), and we saw how the tactic state changed. The following was an example actually done in a lecture towards the end of the course (I was using my custom preliminary lemmas numbered as in my lecture notes, so this will not compile in mathlib, but should give an idea):</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"sd\">/-- Theorem XI.6 (Compactness implies completeness) -/</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">theorem</span> <span class=\"n\">compact_implies_complete</span>\n  <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">X</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"o\">}</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">metric_space</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"o\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">is_seq_compact_space</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">is_complete_space</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">begin</span>\n  <span class=\"c1\">-- Assume that X is compact.</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">assume</span> <span class=\"n\">X_cpt</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n\n  <span class=\"c1\">-- Let xs be a sequence, and assume it is Cauchy.</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">intro</span> <span class=\"n\">xs</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"k\">assume</span> <span class=\"n\">xs_Cauchy</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n\n  <span class=\"c1\">-- Since X is compact, the sequence xs has a convergent subsequence xsub.</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">rcases</span> <span class=\"n\">X_cpt</span> <span class=\"n\">xs</span> <span class=\"k\">with</span> <span class=\"o\">⟨</span><span class=\"n\">xsub</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"o\">⟨</span><span class=\"n\">xsub_subseq</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">xsub_conv</span><span class=\"o\">⟩⟩,</span>\n\n  <span class=\"c1\">-- By Lemma X.5 the Cauchy sequence xs with a convergent subsequence xsub is itself convergent.</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">apply</span> <span class=\"n\">Cauchy_with_convergent_subseq_implies_convergent</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">refine</span> <span class=\"o\">⟨</span><span class=\"n\">xs_Cauchy</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"o\">⟨</span><span class=\"n\">xsub</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"o\">⟨</span><span class=\"n\">xsub_subseq</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">xsub_conv</span><span class=\"o\">⟩⟩⟩,</span>\n\n  <span class=\"c1\">-- QED.</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">end</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>In the course feedback questionnaire I asked about the helpfulness of Lean. Very few people had any opinions (very few attended the experimental lectures). The handful who had opinions were polarized: a few said it was very helpful (which probably just meant they enjoyed seeing a new game) and a few said it was very unhelpful. Don't worry, I am stubborn and I have not given up yet... I think the success is very much dependent on the implementation, and mine was a first experiment only.</p>\n<p>One implementation issue that I tried but abandoned at the students' request was Observable notebooks such as <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@kkytola/metsp2022_lec02\">this</a>. They were very slow for using Lean, and typing even ordinary text and math was slow (so I switched to a virtual blackboard). But I think notebooks of this flavor <em>could</em> work very well, with better preparation. I loved <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"123965\">@Bryan Gin-ge Chen</span>'s Lean tools for Observable in principle, although I abandoned this format after two lectures, and later only showed Lean in a shared VS Code window.</p>",
