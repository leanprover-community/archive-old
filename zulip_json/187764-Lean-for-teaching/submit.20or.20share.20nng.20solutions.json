I added this feature to my fork (see <a href=\"https://github.com/mmasdeu/lean-game-maker\">https://github.com/mmasdeu/lean-game-maker</a>). The idea is that you can write part of the solution so that the player only fills in a sorry or two in it. Maybe you want o show the structure of the proof, or do one case as illustration and let the player do the other...</p>\n<p>Another feature which I don't know how to do would be to have levels with two (or more) lemmas such that solving one of them gives you the check. That would be useful to ask questions like \"Which of the two statements is true? Prove it.\"</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>",

One thing I didn't like about NNG was that every lemma needed its own page, after a while I didn't have anything in particular to say about some levels -- \"you know all the tactics, we need these results for later, just prove the below\". It would be good if we could have multiple things happening on one page and flexibility for what needs to be done (e.g. \"prove both of these\" or \"prove precisely one of these\" etc)</p>",
