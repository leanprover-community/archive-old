I've just been going from the installation instructions for Windows and OSX from the community web site, here: <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/</a>. I haven't tried the one-click installers. Some possible advantages, per your question, include: </p>\n<p>(1) No potential conflicts with local configurations (we've had to ask Windows users to remove old Python installations that don't work with the installation instructions for Windows, for example).<br>\n(2) The same, fully configured Ubuntu 20.04 LTS operating system environment for everyone, so that we don't have to document variants across OSX and Windows.<br>\n(3) A project that is already backed by a GitHub repository.<br>\n(4) Ease of evolution of the development environment. E.g., we can push an update to the OS layer, then all one needs to do is \"Rebuild Container\" in VSCode to get the updated environment.</p>\n<p>Thanks, again, for pointing me to the one-click installer. Where are those documented? I don't see that information on the Lean Community documentation page.</p>\n<p>Kind regards,<br>\nKevin</p>",

Within a day of being pointed to our instructions,, about 85% had this environment configuration running and tested successfully, without having needed any help. The remaining ~15% had various issues. Most were easily resolved. Relevant fixes have been applied where applicable. One problem required some exploration to come up with a plausible solution: there seems to be an ongoing conflict between Docker Desktop and VirtualBox on Windows. This poses problems to students who are required to use both. Only one student was at issue here, but the severity of this issue elsewhere would depend on local conditions: the extent to which co-location of these tools on your OS is a requirement. Take this for what it's worth: I'd rate it as a very smooth adoption processes for most of the students, and the residual issues were mostly resolved in just a few minutes each. My students don't have any problem with it, and seem to like it.</p>",
