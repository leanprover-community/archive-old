The \"formal\" proofs of high school geometry are typically the only places where students are exposed to discovering proofs, as opposed to mere rote computations. The author asserts that formal proofs have their place. They should be used whenever there is a crisis, whenever there is a paradox, when our intuition doesn't suffice.<br>\nIn particular, students should first do lots of freestyle exploration before being exposed to formal proofs.</p>\n<p>I think I agree with most of what the author says. Given the current state of our high school curricula, this means that we get freshmen at university that don't know what maths is about, and that don't know what a proof is supposed to be.</p>\n<p>I know for a fact that I find it extremely annoying to grade Linear Algebra exams that are full of sentences that don't typecheck. Coming from that angle, it is very natural to teach students Lean in their first semester, so that at least they are aware of what it means to prove something, and to write down meaningful formulas.</p>\n<p>On the other hand (and I had not yet appreciated this so much before) the author claims that these students are in fact not yet ripe for formal proofs. They should first learn to play and run and leap and fall and scramble and climb in the world of mathematics before destroying the proofs by formalised accounts of their adventures.</p>\n<p>I'm quite curious about your opinions on these issues.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I'm not sure that formalisation is actually the enemy of \"to play and run and leap and fall and scramble and climb\".</p>\n<p>The enemy is teaching people \"the quadratic formula\" and asking them to use it over and over again. One should learn to use the quadratic formula only in service of learning why there is such a formula, roughly its shape (which sometimes matters), and how in most subsequent instances to ask a computer to do it for you. </p>\n<p>Similarly for Gaussian elimination --- teaching what it really says, what you can expect to gain from it, when it's a relevant tool, how to ask the computer to do it for you, and why the computer sometimes gives silly answers, are all more helpful that drilling people to be able to do it on an exam with some contrived explicit matrix. (I'm as much to blame as anyone here; I've done the wrong thing here too many times, without the energy to rewrite courses, get sign-off from other departments, etc, etc.)</p>\n<p>I'm fully aware that students handed a theorem prover have an unfortunate tendency to blindly bash their way around (I succumb to the same temptation too often). But they're still doing something fantastic --- they're exploring and communicating (at least with the computer) and hitting their head against difficult things and hopefully learning something.</p>\n<p>Finally, at the end of the day, we don't use (should not use?) interactive theorem provers because we're worried about rigour, and want to pin down all our proofs like lifeless butterflies. They're here (they're coming?) because, just like computer algebra systems, they are (will, hopefully, one day be?) tools that will let us explore more quickly and more freely.</p>",
