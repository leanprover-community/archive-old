This way the issue of expecting some students to use the tool against their will doesn't come into play. Although there may be some bias related to the frustration of volunteering and not being chosen to learn Lean, since the Lean volunteers seem to be the smartest ones (and probably the hungriest).</p>\n<p>I'm looking forward to incoming studies and results!</p>",
