As you may know, Lean already has experimental Alectryon support, and our <a href=\"https://github.com/coq-community/hydra-battles/tree/master/doc/movies\">tooling</a> could be adapted on top of that.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03404668v2/document#page=11\">here</a> (Figure 8 in the paper) for a nice example of what snippet-based documentation can look like.</p>\n<p>With P.
