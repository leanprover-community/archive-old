Ideally this should turn into a mathlib PR. I would stay well away from planar graphs right now as there will be several competing formalised definitions and they'll be hard to work with. I don't know enough about the area to know a nice healthy list of basic theorems but one should fix a definition of graph (e.g. undirected, at most one edge between two vertices, no edge from a vertex to itself?) and then develop a basic theory, enough to make it usable for teaching.</p>",
