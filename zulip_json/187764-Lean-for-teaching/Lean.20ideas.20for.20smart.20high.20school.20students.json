Some things which would probably work well are (1) a natural-number-game-like thing and (2) a discussion of induction including induction on equality (e.g. <a href=\"https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2021/04/03/induction-and-inductive-types/\">https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2021/04/03/induction-and-inductive-types/</a> and  <a href=\"https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2021/04/18/induction-on-equality/\">https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2021/04/18/induction-on-equality/</a>). Something else which would fit well into this could be an introduction to group theory, up to and including a construction of the Knuth-Bendix confluent rewrite system for group theory a la <a href=\"https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/formalising-mathematics/blob/master/src/week_2/Part_A_groups.lean\">https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/formalising-mathematics/blob/master/src/week_2/Part_A_groups.lean</a> , which is a fancy way of saying \"make <code>simp</code> solve (a * b) * 1⁻¹⁻¹ * b⁻¹ * (a⁻¹ * a⁻¹⁻¹⁻¹) * a = 1`. Each of these could be run as either one or two sessions I would imagine.</p>",
