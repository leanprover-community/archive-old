Has anyone else tried that?</p>\n<p>What I like about those notebooks is that it is possible to write <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mtext>LaTeX</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\LaTeX</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8988em;vertical-align:-0.2155em;\"></span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord textrm\">L</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:-0.36em;\"></span><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.905em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord textrm mtight sizing reset-size6 size3\">A</span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:-0.15em;\"></span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord textrm\">T</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:-0.1667em;\"></span><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.4678em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.7845em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:3em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord textrm\">E</span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.2155em;\"><span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:-0.125em;\"></span><span class=\"mord textrm\">X</span></span></span></span></span></span> in the markdown cells and <img alt=\":lean:\" class=\"emoji\" src=\"https://zulip-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/3121/emoji/images/17579.png\" title=\"lean\"> in the editors that Bryan's tools enable. And all of this is still editable (with working Lean infoview) even by the students on their own.</p>\n<p>The main problem I encountered is that recently the embedded Lean editors have become really really slow for me (I thought they were faster before, but might be mistaken). Custom compilations of only the necessary parts of mathlib might be an option, if I had the computer skills. I wish I understood what makes the difference in the speed of the browser-running Lean things such as playgrounds, <a href=\"https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/\">NNG</a>s, Gitpod, Observable, etc. It looks like some of them (at least Gitpod) are fast enough for \"live use\". Anyways, I guess my backup plan is to switch to VS Code for any live editing, and then copy-paste back to the notebook...</p>\n<p>I'd be curious to hear if anyone else has used Bryan's tools for teaching!</p>",

As far as slowness is concerned, unfortunately the notebooks (and the Lean web editor) run a version of Lean directly in your browser with a significant performance penalty, so it doesn't really work well past a certain point. Gitpod runs a version of Lean on a remote server, so it's much quicker. In principle it could be possible to set up the notebooks to communicate with remote servers as well, but I didn't have the time to explore it. I did play around with connecting the notebooks to a local Lean server <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@bryangingechen/lean-websocketd?collection=@bryangingechen/lean\">here</a> but it was only a proof of concept (and I'm not sure if it still works).</p>\n<p>If you do want to try to prepare smaller bundles for use in web editors, the instructions <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-web-editor\">here</a> should hopefully get you started. Again, feel free to ping me if you get stuck.</p>",

I had no idea that's how Gitpod works.</p>\n<p>I had noticed the existence of your local Lean server solution, but it still looked complicated to me. Since Lean is only a small extra component in what I will be doing in my course, I think I will not try to set up a local server this semester --- I will just temporarily switch to VS Code when necessary. (Another small advantage is that the \"hover\" in VS Code shows a bigger portion of the docstring than the Observable editor, so we can view the definitions and theorem statements in natural language by the hover. The biggest disadvantage of VS Code to me is the lack of LaTeX and maybe also pictures, which are available in the Observable notebook. Also Lean in VS Code would be more difficult for the students to play around with.) In any case, I really appreciate both what you have done and the offer to help with using it!</p>",
