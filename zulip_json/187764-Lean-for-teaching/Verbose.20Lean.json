I'm sorry some people have been waiting for this for nearly one year. The result can be found at <a href=\"https://github.com/PatrickMassot/lean-verbose\">https://github.com/PatrickMassot/lean-verbose</a>. I didn't spend time figuring out the best translation, for lack of time and English language fluency. I'm sure people will soon suggest nice improvements. Please keep in mind this is a hack that will probably be very easy to improve in Lean 4 (see the <a href=\"https://github.com/PatrickMassot/lean-verbose/blob/master/README.md\">README</a> for information about the price to pay for abusing the Lean 3 parser). And I guess even the Lean 4 won't be able to compete with actual controlled natural language dedicated parsers, but <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110024\">@Sebastian Ullrich</span>  should feel very free to prove me wrong.</p>",
