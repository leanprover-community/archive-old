I am a student of <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"260507\">@Heather Macbeth</span> and I am trying to compile a sphinx repository made by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110865\">@Jeremy Avigad</span> (<a href=\"https://github.com/avigad/mathematics_in_lean_source\">https://github.com/avigad/mathematics_in_lean_source</a>) but I am running into a problem. When I build the html files for the project, some of the lean files are not being found through the mkdoc script. Therefore I will get an error such as:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Text only\"><pre><span></span><code>source/02_Basics.rst:11: CRITICAL: Problems with \"include\" directive path:\nInputError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'source/02_Basics/01_Calculating.inc'.\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I tried fiddling with the mkdoc file and I can get some of the lean file to appear, but then the regular expressions fail to parse some of the lean code and latex. <br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/fD_6TNupyeX9-vV4LTdhvy6O/Screen-Shot-2022-06-11-at-4.53.00-PM.png\">Screen-Shot-2022-06-11-at-4.53.00-PM.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/fD_6TNupyeX9-vV4LTdhvy6O/Screen-Shot-2022-06-11-at-4.53.00-PM.png\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2022-06-11-at-4.53.00-PM.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/fD_6TNupyeX9-vV4LTdhvy6O/Screen-Shot-2022-06-11-at-4.53.00-PM.png\"></a></div><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.

        "content": "<p>Hi, Matthew. I am sorry that the process is not well documented. It's not really designed for public use. Improving it and documenting it is on my very long list of things to do.</p>\n<p>To build e.g. the html, the following should work, from the top level folder:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">lean_source</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span><span class=\"n\">mkall.sh</span>\n<span class=\"n\">make</span> <span class=\"n\">html</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>If you want the pdf instead, change the second line to <code>make latexpdf</code>. Most of the source material is in the directory <code>lean_source</code>. The first line runs a Python script to generate the Sphinx source, the exercises, and the solutions from the Lean source files.</p>\n<p>To start with, you need Sphinx and the readthedocs template:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html\">https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html</a></p>\n<p>Adding a new section requires adding it to the chapter under <code>source</code>, adding it to the list of things to complie in <code>mkall.sh</code>, and then putting the source code in the right place under <code>lean_source</code>.</p>\n<p>Adding a new chapter requires creating a new <code>.rst</code> file under <code>source</code>, and adding it to <code>index.rst</code>.</p>\n<p>Creating your own textbook follows suit. The file <code>index.rst</code> should list all the chapters, there should be a <code>.rst</code> file under <code>source</code> for each chapter that imports all the sections, there should be a Lean file in <code>lean_source</code> corresponding to each section, and <code>mkall.sh</code> should list all the sections.</p>",
