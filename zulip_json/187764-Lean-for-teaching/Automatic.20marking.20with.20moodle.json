They then each get separate GH repos housing their work. Students submit by just updating the repository. </p>\n<p>For automatic grading, you need to fill out an yaml file for building the underlying GH action and a <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/use-autograding\">autograding.json</a> which specifies what commands to run, what outputs are expected, and how to score the results. </p>\n<p>GH classroom has no built in functionality akin to a gradebook. I just end up looking at the outcome of the action and have that help guide me when I look at the actual file. Then I submit feedback and scores on Microsoft Teams where we have a team for the course.</p>",
