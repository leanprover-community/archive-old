The student has experience with natural deduction and informal proof, but not with Lean.</p>\n<p>I wonder, does anyone have any ideas for an appropriately-sized project that an enthusiastic but inexperienced student might be able to complete in one semester? Bonus points if the project could constitute an open source contribution somewhere - the student is aiming to get into a graduate program, and could use the CV item. More quotidian things (like \"work through this book and update it to Lean 4\") are fine.</p>",
