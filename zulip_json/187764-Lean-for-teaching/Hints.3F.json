        "content": "<p>Last year I started too fast because I underestimated how students didn't understand anything in the previous semester. So I'm currently lecturing this again but, after four weeks, I'm not yet where I expected to be at the end of the first lecture last year. Each session lasts two hours. It starts with explanations on the blackboard (involving no type theory at all) and then they play with Lean. Remember the context: they are first year undergrads that did no proper math in high school, are meant to be above average but not great (although a couple of them are great by accident). They has one semester of calculus where lectures include epsilons but exercises sessions and exams don't. So far I did four weeks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some calculations (this is all they know before coming), first explicitly rewriting using <code>mul_assoc</code> etc. then using <code>calc</code> and then a killer tactic (I have a <code>compute</code> tactic that tries <code>norm_num</code>, <code>ring</code> and <code>abel</code>)</li>\n<li>Implication, iff and conjunction. Proving things like <code>a \\le b \\iff a+c \\le b+c</code> using that <code>a\\le b</code> iff <code>0 \\le b-a</code> and computing. </li>\n<li>Finishing the above and some more abstract exercises in using implications and iff: some exercise about variables <code>P Q : Prop</code> instead of actual statement. The master exercise was then proving that, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> being natural numbers, <code>a |b iff gcd(a,b) a</code> using only reflexivity and antisymetry of divisibility and the fact that <code>c | gcd a b \\iff c | a\\and c | b</code> (in Lean and on paper)</li>\n<li>Universal quantifier and disjunction (disjunction was not done earlier for lack of time and because I saw last year that it's very complicated for students). Exercises on <code>forall</code> where about even and odd functions, and then increasing and decreasing functions. First exercises on <code>or</code> where all about <code>x*y = 0 iff x = 0 or y= 0</code>. Then exercises mixed both using stuff like <code>x \\le y or y &lt; x</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next time I'll finish the exercises on <code>forall</code> and <code>or</code> and start with <code>exists</code> (probably mostly using divisibility and surjective functions). Then I'll be able to start exercises about limits (that I hoped to do at the end of the first class last year...). Then there will be negations and proofs by contradiction and contrapositive. This will probably take the bulk of the remaining weeks, but I'd like to do proofs by induction at the end. I have 12 weeks only.</p>",
