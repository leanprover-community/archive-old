I have never before opened this domain there though, so I think that is a big part of whether something works or doesn't. <br>\nOn this note, the SharedWorker that is currently being used to run the searching script separately in a parallel thread is actually not supported extensively. For example, it doesn't have any support on Safari on desktop and any Android browser except Firefox, unfortunately. Internet Explorer of course is also out of the game. Thus it's probably best to find another approach in the future that is both flexible and compatible with more browsers.</p>",
