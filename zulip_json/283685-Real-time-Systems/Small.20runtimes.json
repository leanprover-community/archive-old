As for the issue of gmp in the runtime, do you think it is possible to compile against mini-gmp <a href=\"https://gmplib.org/repo/gmp-6.2/file/tip/mini-gmp\">https://gmplib.org/repo/gmp-6.2/file/tip/mini-gmp</a> or even something like <a href=\"https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/gmp-ino/\">https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/gmp-ino/</a>. I haven't tried using leanc myself so I have no idea if this is possible even, just a thought that came to mind when reading the post <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"127136\">@Alex J. Best</span>  That's an interesting idea.  The bigger problem if I recall correctly is that for technical reasons currently every constant in the Lean compiler/interpreter gets included in the Lean standard library.   I think a fix will need to be developed when the compiler is ported from C++ to Lean.</p>",
