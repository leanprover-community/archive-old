I've tried asking in #lean4 but they mostly just get buried. </p>\n<p>I was playing around with the LCNF compiler, and wondered if there is any way to run <code>Compiler.compile</code> on an input file? I want to try something like <code>Elab.runFrontend</code>, where I give the function a filename and it will parse the file and compile it for me, then return the output. I did try hacking around a bit and discovered that LCNF declarations are saved in a persistent env extension, which was really helpful, but I'm confused as to where exactly these declarations are being added to the env? It seems like they are as soon as each definition command is elaborated -- that's my best guess at least. If someone could shed some light on this, I would really appreciate it!</p>\n<p>Also, is there any way to turn off a compiler pass entirely? (Like <code>specialize</code> for example)</p>",
