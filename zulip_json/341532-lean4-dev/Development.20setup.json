Are the command lines below a \"fire and forget\" kind of thing I shouldn't worry about right now?  I think I get the gist of what it's saying (I think it's pointing \"lean4\" to be a link to the stage1 version of Lean, i.e. the version written in itself - correct?) but I'm barely getting to grips with the language and the rest of the ecosystem is still very much opaque to me - so want to make sure I can undo any damage I may cause.</p>\n<p>Any clarifications/real-world recommendations on setting up a good dev env would be appreciated!</p>",
