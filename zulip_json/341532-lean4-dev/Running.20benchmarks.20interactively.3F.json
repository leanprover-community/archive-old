I was wondering why this situation would be different from modifying anything else in our codebase (as changes seem to be picked up fine elsewhere).</p>\n<p>Also, how do I run a particular benchmark test (or test in general) non-interactively? There's probably a way to pass in the name of a specific test when doing <code>make test</code> right? (and let me know if there's some documentation I've neglected to read). Thanks!</p>",
