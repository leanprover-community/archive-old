In the infoview, you can hover over subterm, and I added a \"zoom\" button to those popups that automatically inserts the correct <code>enter</code> command to get from the goal to the subterm. For example, let's say our goal is <code>x + y = y + x + 0</code>, now we can hover over the second x, click \"zoom\", and the button will insert <code>enter [2, 1, 2]</code> at the correct position.</p>\n<p>For that I used the cursor position, for example, I use it to find the position in the document syntax tree that I need to insert the <code>enter</code> at and I use it to get the goal.</p>",
