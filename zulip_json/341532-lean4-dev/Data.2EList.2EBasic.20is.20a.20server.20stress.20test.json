The current issue that I am running into is that if you make a modification in the middle of the file like <code>#print foo</code>, there is approximately a 3 second pause before anything happens, after which point the command is executed and the loading indicator runs off to start processing later commands. So I'm guessing this is the cost of parsing the file?</p>",
