I'm looking at doc/flake.nix, seems \"examples\" folder is handled specially, so perhaps I need to add <code>monads = renderDir \"monads\" ./monads;</code>, but I don't understand why <code>renderLean</code> is making an examples folder, perhaps that needs to be a variable name?  Another special think seems to be on line 43 with <code>cp -r ${examples}/* examples/</code> which I don't understand, and I don't understand why <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/master/doc/examples/palindromes.lean.md\">boiler plate *.lean.md files</a> have to be checked in, is this also a Nix thing?  Anyway, I would love to have this cleaned up and generalized by a Nix expert so that there is no special-casing and we can leaninkify any new folder in the future without having to touch this file.</p>",
