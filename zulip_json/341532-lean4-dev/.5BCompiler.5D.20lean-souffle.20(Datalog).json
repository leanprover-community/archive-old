I see something related to TRMC.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sorry for the vague and potentially misleading thread title.</p>\n<p>This initially started as my own learning of LCNF. To motivate that I wanted to gather some basic statistics on tail calls in the code base, recursive but not tail call definitions, TRMC, etc (to be expanded on). For instance, are there recursive definition that could be made into a tail call? How many potential definitions could benefit from a TRMC pass? Or, could we have some set of queries looking for pattens we do not want to see in LCNF after all the passes ran? And so on. Nothing that would directly impact the compiler deliverables at this point (this would never become a pass per se, for instance), but a learning motivation for me nonetheless.</p>\n<p>I then created an LCNF exporter for <a href=\"https://gephi.org/\">Gephi</a> as a way for me to visualize LCNF. This it turned out to be less useful than I thought (but I can't say I really know how to use Gephi). I will create another Github repo with this experiment for posterity.</p>\n<p>At this point, Datalog seemed like a great middle ground betweeen Probing and Gephi. And, Souffle seemed like a good and scalable option. I created an exporter for Souffle that exports all LCNF Decl and then started creating some of these Datalog rules/queries.</p>\n<p>I mentioned my progress in the compiler meeting, and some expressed an interest in taking a peek. This is the reason I am posting it here.</p>\n<p>This can take many directions and some completely unrelated to the compiler. At this point my main motivation is to expand the set of queries directly related to compiler optimizations, but I would need some extra input for that.</p>",

(Java, Go, etc. all use it with great effect and they have very weak type systems.)</p>\n<p>All you need to know that is the callee doesn't hang on the pointer of the object (by returning it or storing it somewhere).  If you know that, you can basically replace <code>lean_object * foo = malloc(...);</code> by <code>lean_ctor_object foo_impl; lean_object * foo = &amp;foo_impl;</code>.  You don't even need to change the ABI, just make sure that nobody tries to free the pointer (for example by decrementing the reference counter).</p>\n<p>I think the main question here is how fine grained the analysis should be.  It should be very easy to store whether the top-level object escapes: i.e., whether <code>func (Foo.ctor1 x (Foo.ctor2 y z))</code> could allocate the outer object on the stack (but we don't know about the inner one).  It would be cool if we had enough information to know if <code>Foo.ctor2 y z</code> doesn't escape either.</p>",

Let <code>A</code> be a function that creates/allocates some memory using a constructor and assigns it to a let variable named <code>v1</code>. To allocate this chunk of memory on the stack, we need to make sure that no references to it or its parameters escapes the scope of function 'A' directly or indirectly in the return value.</p>\n<p>Now, I can see how supporting this for all cases may get trickier since:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a reference to any part of this memory may escape and not just the root reference (e.g. only Pair.fst or Pair.snd instead of Pair).  </li>\n<li>this escape analysis needs to make sure it also deals with aliasing, which just adds indirections to the actual allocated memory (curious: do we eliminate no-op aliases in LCNF (<code>let x.1 := x2</code>)?</li>\n<li>we need to track this across all nested function calls that use a reference allocated in function A.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In other words, we need to check whether the memory referenced by <code>v1</code> is reachable from the value(s) returned by function A.</p>\n<p>What would be a minimal and useful case?</p>\n<p>Considering that we have all the data as relations, I am tempted to try to get a points-to analysis in place first, since it seems to be needed for the escape analysis, no?</p>",
