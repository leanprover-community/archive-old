The positions are research only, but teaching at the University of Sydney is possible if desired. The successful candidate will have considerable time and flexibility to pursue their own research program.</p>\n<p>We are after either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>excellent mathematicians with some interest in programming and modern AI;</li>\n<li>excellent computer scientists with some interest and background in mathematics, as well as an interest in using AI to attack tough problems in mathematics.<br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See the linked blogpost for further links.</p>",
