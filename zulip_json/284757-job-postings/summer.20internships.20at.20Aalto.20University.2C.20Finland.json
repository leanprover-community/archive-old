These are topics numbered 4201 and 4202 in the <a href=\"https://www.aalto.fi/en/aalto-science-institute/asci-summer-research-program-2022-project-list\">list of internship projects</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are interested, you can ask me for more details!</p>\n<p>Further advertisement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The AScI intership program arranges social events, day-trips, help with housing, etc.</li>\n<li>We are organizing an ICM satellite on <a href=\"https://icm2022.org/probability-and-mathematical-physics\">Probability and Mathematical Physics</a> in Helsinki just before the ICM itself. The summer interns also get to participate and help in the organization.</li>\n<li>There's a direct train from Helsinki to Saint Petersburg, if you plan to spend your summer vacation at the <a href=\"https://icm2022.org/index\">ICM</a>!

        "content": "<p>In the summer of 2023 we will again have formalization internships at Aalto University. The arrangements are mostly similar to the above (except no ICM satellites this year <span aria-label=\"grinning face with smiling eyes\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f601\" role=\"img\" title=\"grinning face with smiling eyes\">:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:</span> --- which probably means less conference organization and more formalization).</p>\n<p>The precise formalization topics are to be selected in due time with the interns' interests and preferences taken into account, but probability and analysis are priorities, because I feel like those areas would particularly benefit from an increased number of contributors. (Also the interns would essentially be a part of our mathematical physics group, where most research topics have a probability / analysis / representation theory flavor.)</p>\n<p>Link to the official internship programme info:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.aalto.fi/en/open-positions/aalto-science-institute-asci-international-summer-research-programme-2023\">https://www.aalto.fi/en/open-positions/aalto-science-institute-asci-international-summer-research-programme-2023</a></p>\n<p>Link to FAQ:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.aalto.fi/en/aalto-science-institute-asci/how-to-apply-to-the-asci-international-summer-research-programme\">https://www.aalto.fi/en/aalto-science-institute-asci/how-to-apply-to-the-asci-international-summer-research-programme</a></p>\n<p>I'll be happy to answer any questions for example on this Zulip!</p>",
