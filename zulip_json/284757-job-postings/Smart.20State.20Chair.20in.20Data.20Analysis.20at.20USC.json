This is a tenured, 9-month, full Professor position in the Department of Mathematics with the earliest starting date on August 16, 2023. The Center is co-sponsored by $2 million from the South Carolina SmartState Program established by the South Carolina General Assembly in 2002 (<a href=\"http://smartstatesc.org/\">http://smartstatesc.org/</a>) and by $2 million from the University of South Carolina for a total endowment of $4 million. The primary appointment of the Chair will be within the Department of Mathematics, College of Arts and Sciences.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I expect the position to come with very strong compensation and the ability to hire (subject to university approval) multiple persons at the tenure-track level. </p>\n<p>If you have any questions or any suggestions, please let me know. For more general info, see the <a href=\"https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs/list/21212\">ad on Mathjobs</a>.</p>",
