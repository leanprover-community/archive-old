We will evolve the Lean4 ecosystem by improving the lean mathlibrary mathlib, lean’s tactic framework, and lean itself with the objective to streamline formal verification of compilers and programming languages. We will then use this technology to formally verify the foundations of the MLIR compiler stack.</p>\n<p>You may know <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"130575\">@Siddharth Bhat</span>  and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110044\">@Chris Hughes</span> from my group already.
