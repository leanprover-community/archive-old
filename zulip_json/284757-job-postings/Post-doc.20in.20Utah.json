The position is to help with their Science Research Initiative, \"a unique program that focuses on providing undergraduate students with authentic research experiences during their first and second year of college\". It was suggested that Lean might be a good fit for generating an authentic research experience appropriate for undergraduate mathematicians. PS Don't contact me about the job -- I'm just circulating the ad for someone else.</p>",
