I'm already having a blast at the conference! </p>\n<p>Heather mentioned the possibility yesterday, in private conversation, of having a session on Lean and teaching. This doesn't need to be terribly structured to be super helpful. E.g. I, and several others I've talked with, are from US liberal arts colleges. These make up 70% of the colleges and universities in the US. Fun and engaging ways to teach students intro Algebra and Analysis would spread like wildfire among these institutions. But there are pitfalls to using Lean for this purpose. A discussion of pitfalls and recommendations would be very valuable.</p>",
