I've finally got the organisational hiccups worked out. So, if you are a mathematician, or you know a mathematician who is really interested in learning more about Lean, please let them know about this meeting: <a href=\"https://math.commelin.net/2020/lftcm/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://math.commelin.net/2020/lftcm/\">https://math.commelin.net/2020/lftcm/</a></p>\n<p>The plan is to have a couple of talks and tutorial sessions, but to also have ~50% of the time dedicated to hackathons and brainstorming sessions, or pair programming. Novices could team up with experts, to see how they go about setting up a theory, etc...</p>\n<p>There is limited funding for PhD students and postdocs. Please let me know if you need this.<br>\nIn general, if you have any questions, please ask.</p>\n<p>ping: <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110031\">@Patrick Massot</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110038\">@Kevin Buzzard</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110050\">@Sebastien Gouezel</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110596\">@Rob Lewis</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"214703\">@Yury G.

I think the plan is to have a Europe-centric notion of \"morning\" and \"afternoon\" sessions. People in the americas could come to the afternoon sessions without much trouble.

We should strive to have recordings of lectures available immediately after the session, for the benefit of people in non-european timezones. Twitch does this automatically for kevin's content there.</p>",
