        "content": "<p>To summarize my recollection (mixed with an unknown quantity of editorializing): there are at least two distinct meta-levels you can consider when doing mathematics (normally, but especially in the computer).</p>\n<p>In the first meta-level, you are thinking about rings and vector spaces and arguing about all things with property X having property Y and so on; this is the mentality of the working mathematician, and in this mode the computer is giving you a language to talk about abstract objects, and so you want to think about <code>hP : P</code> as \"<code>P</code> is true\".</p>\n<p>In the next meta-level up, you step back and look at what you are doing and say \"hey, I'm writing words on a page, bytes in a computer, and creating a finite object, namely a proof\". In the first meta-level proof didn't really enter the picture, only facts, but really you were constructing proofs the whole time. But proofs are objects too, they can be coded as natural numbers and verified by machines and all that good stuff. When you are thinking about this metalevel, <code>hP : P</code> is really a piece of syntax, representing part of a lambda function that if you apply to a closed term might be a proof of some statement. So it's not really directly a proof, but certainly something like <code>theorem sylow_1 : ...</code> is a proof.</p>\n<p>You can of course also do mathematics at the second meta-level, that's usually the domain of logic and proof theory, and most type theorists spend a significant amount of time thinking about this level, but at some point the mathematics gets complicated enough that it starts to look like the first level again and you might consider stepping back once more. Most logical foundations like metamath or LF work at the third meta-level, where they are verification systems that let you define axiom systems that let you do mathematics.</p>",

The most straightforward way to give CIC a set-theoretic semantics is to interpret types as sets, interpret \"t : T\" as elementhood, and interpret Prop as, say, the set { emptyset, {0} }.</p>\n<p>With that interpretation, when we write down the Goldbach conjecture, we are just writing a fancy definition of the set { x in {0} | Goldbach is true ). Establishing \"t : P\" means showing that there is something in P, which means showing that it is not the empty set, which means showing that it is true. In that case, t is just a fancy notation for 0.</p>\n<p>The fact that, as an expression, t has enough information for a deterministic type checker to determine that it is in P means we can think of t as evidence that P is true, or a proof that P is true. It's like showing a number is composite by giving the factors. If I write 111 = 37 * 3 and you have the means to check the calculation, then we have \"proved\" that 111 is composite. So we have shown that \"111 is composite\" is true, and given that the expression \"37 * 3\" gave you the information you needed to confirm that, you can think of that expression as a proof.</p>\n<p>That doesn't preclude other ways of thinking about type theory, but I think it is important to make it clear to a general mathematical audience that there is nothing deeply mysterious about it. If you can make sense of something like \"the set of x in {0} such that the Goldbach conjecture is true,\" you can make sense of propositions as types.</p>",
