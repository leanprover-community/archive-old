        "content": "<p>Hello. I am currently trying to read through the mathlib stuff on Grothendieck topologies, and whilst reading about sieves I stumbled upon this wierd <code>eq_to_hom</code> defined as:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"sd\">/--</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">An equality `X = Y` gives us a morphism `X ‚ü∂ Y`.</span>\n\n<span class=\"sd\">It is typically better to use this, rather than rewriting by the equality then using `ùüô _`</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">which usually leads to dependent type theory hell.</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">-/</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">def</span> <span class=\"n\">eq_to_hom</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">X</span> <span class=\"n\">Y</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">C</span><span class=\"o\">}</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">p</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">Y</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span> <span class=\"bp\">‚ü∂</span> <span class=\"n\">Y</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"kd\">by</span> <span class=\"n\">rw</span> <span class=\"n\">p</span><span class=\"bp\">;</span> <span class=\"n\">exact</span> <span class=\"mi\">ùüô</span> <span class=\"n\">_</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>As someone who isnt too well-versed in LEAN yet I am quite confused why this definition is necessary. According to the comment it seems like this is used in order to avoid having to rewrite the equality and then using <code>ùüô _</code>.  But isnt this exactly what the definition is doing? I guess my question is, whats the difference between using eq_to_hom as opposed to the other method (other than being shorter I guess). Here is a simple example of it in action:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">def</span> <span class=\"n\">presieve</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">X</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">C</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"bp\">Œ†</span> <span class=\"o\">‚¶É</span><span class=\"n\">Y</span><span class=\"o\">‚¶Ñ,</span> <span class=\"n\">set</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">Y</span> <span class=\"bp\">‚ü∂</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"sd\">/-- The singleton presieve.  -/</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">-- Note we can't make this into `has_singleton` because of the out-param.</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">def</span> <span class=\"n\">singleton</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">presieve</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span>\n<span class=\"bp\">Œª</span> <span class=\"n\">Z</span> <span class=\"n\">g</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"bp\">‚àÉ</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">H</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">Z</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">Y</span><span class=\"o\">),</span> <span class=\"n\">eq_to_hom</span> <span class=\"n\">H</span> <span class=\"bp\">‚â´</span> <span class=\"n\">f</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">g</span>\n</code></pre></div>",
