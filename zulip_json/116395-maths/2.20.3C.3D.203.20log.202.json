The inequality is only just true, and my usual answer would be \"evaluate some decimal places\" but <code>log</code> is noncomputable. That means my usual answer would become \"evaluate some terms of the series expansion, and use that the error of an alternating series truncation is at most the first omitted term\", but that is a lot of machinery.</p>",
