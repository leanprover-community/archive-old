        "content": "<p>The problem is that when we search for <code>normed_group α</code> we then also have to search for <code>has_inner ?? α</code>. Normally this is a big problem, since if you don't know what you are searching for, type-class inference is likely to loop. But in the special case of <code>has_inner</code> this might be fine, if there will never be instances that can be applied indefinitely if <code>𝕜</code> is not known.</p>\n<p>I'm not surprised that if you make <code>[normed_group α]</code> an argument you would then have to provide <code>𝕜</code> when rewriting a norm into a inner product: Lean doesn't know the inner product over which <code>𝕜</code> you need. Type-class inference will only fire once it knows the <code>𝕜</code>. However, you can change the type of <code>𝕜</code> as <code>(𝕜 : out_param Type*)</code> in the definition of <code>inner_product_space</code>. Then you tell Lean to fire type-class inference for <code>inner_product_space</code> even if <code>𝕜</code> is not yet known. Can you test whether that solves your rewrite issues?</p>\n<p>I recommend to make <code>𝕜</code> out_param <em>and</em> move <code>[normed_group α]</code> to an argument. <br>\nA second reason to move <code>normed_group α</code> as an argument is that <code>α</code> might have more structure, that implies that <code>α</code> is a normed group. (Maybe <code>α</code> can be a normed ring?) That will work more smoothly if <code>[normed_group α]</code> is an argument.</p>",
