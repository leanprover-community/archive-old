In the target space, you have the Borel sigma algebra, but we do not register as an instance that a topological space is always endowed with a measurable structure which is the Borel sigma algebra, because sometimes it is not the right thing to do (for instance, it is pretty common to work with the completion of the Borel sigma algebra with respect to some measure). Instead, you should assume that you have a sigma algebra, and in the situation you are considering you want it to be the Borel sigma algebra, which is what <code>borel_space β</code> says. </p>\n<p>If I recall correctly, it was not like that at the start, but the initial setup (where topological spaces have by defaults the borel sigma algebras) created countless problems, and it was refactored by Yury to be like that.</p>",
