However, every source I've seen require both <code>star A * A = 1</code> and <code>A * star A = 1</code> (see e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_operator\">Wikipedia</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.math.uvic.ca/faculty/putnam/ln/C*-algebras.pdf\">these notes</a>). Any objections if I change the definition? (Also, I'd like to change the name to just <code>unitary</code>, it looks much nicer!)</p>",
