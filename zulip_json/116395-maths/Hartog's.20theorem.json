The repo is a bit messy at the moment since this is the first Lean thing I've done, but I'd be curious to do the work to gradually clean it up and upstream to mathlib if there is interest.  The proof is straightforward but required building up some machinery missing from mathlib, in particular harmonic and subharmonic functions.</p>",
