        "content": "<p>I've recently been playing with an implementation of finite probability distributions (and the distribution monad). I can share that work if people are interested, but it isn't the point of this post.</p>\n<p>Obviously, one of the conditions that needs to hold for a pmf is that its sum over its support is 1. As I was doing things finitely, I had to decide how to achieve the finite sum condition. Because I want to sum over arbitrary types (e.g. consider a pmf on the reals which is finitely-supported), it didn't make sense to use finset.sum. I considered finsupp, but the machinery felt too much and for various technical reasons it turned out to be tricky to use. I did have good success with finsum, though.</p>\n<p>As a result of this work, I've ended up with a few finsum lemmas, and I might yet PR these on their own. But I've also found finsum a) a really useful notation and concept, as sometimes you just want to reason about stuff non-constructively and use set.finite a lot, b) quite hard to use in its current form and with the current definition. I note that it doesn't appear to have much actual use in mathlib, and I'm interested in other people's experiences with it. I think there could be a case for an extensive rewrite that aims to more closely mirror finset.sum, but which provides a more fully-featured API that stays within the finsum world (one example: currently there are no finsum lemmas for ordered monoids, which can be a real pain; another example might be that the current definition of finsum (well, finprod, but same difference) provides the facility to sum over functions on Sorts rather on Types, which allows for some quite nice notation - but there isn't lots of interface for that notation).</p>\n<p>I wanted to open a conversation about what the aim of this part of mathlib is, from the perspective of the maintainers, and if there's any interest in reworking it. I don't see any value in adding yet another way of doing finite sums, so to be clear the idea would be to rework finsum (as it's barely used in mathlib, there's a lot of scope to change it without breaking much) rather than add Yet Another Finite Sum.</p>\n<p>Hope this is OK to post. Thanks.</p>\n<p>I was wondering what the history of this bit of mathlib was</p>",
