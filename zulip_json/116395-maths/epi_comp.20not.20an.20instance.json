But regex searches for <code>instance.*epi_comp</code> and <code>instance.*mono_comp</code> show that <code>epi_comp</code> is made a local instance in a couple of mathlib files, whereas <code>mono_comp</code> is made a global instance in <code>category_theory/subobject</code> with no explanation of why this was not done when it was defined. Is there a reason we're asymmetric here? Perhaps because nobody made the lattice of quotient objects?</p>",
