I was surprised to find that although all three of <code>div_lt_iff_lt_mul</code>, <code>lt_mul_of_div_lt</code> and <code>div_lt_of_lt_mul</code> were in Lean, they were in <code>data.int.basic</code> :-) and only applied to ints. This should be some general lemma about ordered monoids or some such thing, right? I might start doing what Chris always encourages me to do, which is to make a super-short PR, assuming that this is actually something missing from mathlib. But is it there and I missed it?</p>",
