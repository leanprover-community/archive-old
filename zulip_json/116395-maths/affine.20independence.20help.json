        "content": "<p>It looks like you have two <code>m</code>-dimensional affine subspaces that contain the points (one containing <code>std_simplex</code>, one where the first coordinate is zero), so one approach would be to prove that their intersection is <code>(m-1)</code>-dimensional, at which point the results in <code>linear_algebra.affine_space.finite_dimensional</code> should be sufficient to finish things off. I suppose this means we need various lemmas about the dimension of an affine subspace given in some form by a single linear equation in coordinates (then some ad hoc argument to get the dimension of the intersection, e.g. via the dimension of the sup). (And coordinates should perhaps be considered generally in terms of an <code>affine_equiv</code> between the affine space and any <code>ι → k</code> with <code>[fintype ι]</code>, with the case where the space is literally <code>ι → k</code> then being a special case of that.)</p>\n<p>Rather than actually defining a notion of dimension (or <code>findim</code>) of an affine subspace we refer to the dimension of its <code>direction</code> (so avoiding duplicating lots of API for dimensions); the <code>findim</code> is a <code>nat</code>, which is generally convenient but does give the empty affine subspace dimension <code>0</code> not <code>-1</code> which might mean you need a special case in the formal proof for <code>m = 0</code>.</p>",
