But I think it would be awesome if we could have them.<br>\nFor stalks: either you do this for points of a topos, and I would think it is then pretty formal (but maybe less intuitive for those not familiar with them, like me). Or you do it for stalks of points in a topological space, which is less general, and you would have to build more bridges. But large parts of it should be formal anyway, since stalks are by definition filtered colimits, and I hope those are preserved by the right sort of adjoint functor.</p>",
