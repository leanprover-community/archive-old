But if I understand correctly, we don't yet have a similar result for L^p, nor do we have the underlying results such as <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/measure_theory.simple_func.integrable_approx_on_univ\">docs#measure_theory.simple_func.integrable_approx_on_univ</a> in the L^p setting.
