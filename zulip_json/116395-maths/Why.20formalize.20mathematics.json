Like Kevin, I prefer \"mathematics.\" I often compare formalization to typesetting; the technology we are using is just a tool to help us do mathematics better, not an end in and of itself. We need to keep saying that over and over until people listen. \"Digital mathematics\" or \"digitized mathematics\" emphasizes that it is just a matter of putting mathematics in a certain format so that we can do useful things. \"Computer-assisted mathematics\" is pretty broad but, I think, also has the right connotations.</p>\n<p>When it came to naming, I considered proposing various alternatives to \"The Hoskinson Center for Formal Mathematics,\" like \"The Hoskinson Center for Formal Methods in Mathematics\" or \"The Hoskinson Center for All the Useful Things That Formal Methods and Software Tools Can Do For Mathematics.\" In the end, we decided that it's hard to beat a short, punchy title, but hopefully it won't obscure the overarching goals.</p>",
