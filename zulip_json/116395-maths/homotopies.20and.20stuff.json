Surprisingly, I didn't find many things that I recognised.</p>\n<p>A search for some relevant words on zulip and in the commit history turned up a few instances of conversations about doing things like the homotopy groups or simplicial complexes (such as <a href=\"#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/simplicial.20complexes.20in.20lean/near/148191703\" title=\"#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/simplicial.20complexes.20in.20lean/near/148191703\">here</a>, but the branch it links to doesn't exist anymore,) and also <a href=\"https://github.com/rwbarton/lean-homotopy-theory\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rwbarton/lean-homotopy-theory\">this separate repository</a> from <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110032\">@Reid Barton</span>  which contains a lot of cool stuff.</p>\n<p>Is there any work currently being done on getting this stuff into mathlib? In particular, are there any things that an interested but relatively-new-to-all-of-this student like me could possibly start doing that might be helpful?</p>",
