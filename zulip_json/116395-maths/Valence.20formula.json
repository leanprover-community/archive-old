(See for example Theorem 1.6.6 on page 16 of this: <a href=\"https://mdave16.github.io/notes/Modular%20Forms%20-%20Marc%20Masdeu.pdf\">https://mdave16.github.io/notes/Modular%20Forms%20-%20Marc%20Masdeu.pdf</a>). The proof requires one to, amongst other things, compute a contour integral, where the contour  is defined by lines and circle segments. I know we can do squares and circle contours but can we do more general ones?</p>\n<p>The reason I ask is that from this one can prove that the spaces of level one modular forms are finite dimensional. Moreover, as in the attached notes (as I was recently reminded) one can prove that the dimensions are finite for other levels as well by using this. Importantly this wouldn't require Riemann--Roch or GAGA to do this.</p>",

For example, in this case, one can (I think) describe the contour as a rectangle with some open balls removed. So one could say a point is in my contour iff its in this rectangle but not in these balls.  Do you think such a thing would be too annoying to work with?</p>",
