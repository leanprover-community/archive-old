But it doesn't work to literally use <code>apply</code>. Possibly the reason is that <code>continuous</code> is a Pi type and this causes <code>apply</code> to guess the wrong number of <code>_</code>s to insert (I think Mario explained this once). Anyways it works fine to use <code>refine</code> and manually specify the correct number of arguments.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
