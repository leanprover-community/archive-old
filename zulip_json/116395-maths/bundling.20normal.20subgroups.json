The general concensus amongst the community is that subgroups of G should also be bundled -- they can be <code>subgroup G</code>. There's a local project at Imperial with bundled subgroups and they're working fine.</p>\n<p>But we're venturing into quotients so we need the notion of a normal subgroup. If we also bundle these as <code>normal_subgroup' G</code> then we have the issue that a normal subgroup of G is now not a subgroup. We can put a coercion to subgroups, but then there's sometimes a coercion from subgroups to subsets, and we are ending up with double coercions and things just don't look good.</p>\n<p>Thinking about how to solve this made me realise that I don't really understand what's going on. Are we bundling subgroups because they just seem to work better? Is the idea that we bundled submodules and they worked really well? Is there an argument for making normal subgroups a typeclass on subgroups? This feels similar to making subgroups a typeclass on subsets  -- which is what the community decided to move away from. What are the disadvantages of letting normal subgroups be a typeclass on bundled subgroups?</p>",

There are two possibilities: (1) bundling (i.e. a new type <code>normal_subgroup G</code>) (2) a predicate <code>is_normal</code> on <code>subgroup G</code> which isn't a class (3) a predicate <code>is_normal</code> on subgroup G` which is a class.</p>\n<p>Mario asked \"when do you need normality anyway?\" and my initial answer was \"teaching\" but now it's \"research\" -- we use quotient groups in the perfectoid project, and currently we're quotienting out by an unbundled normal subgroup. I'd like to get started on this but I don't know what to do. Mario suggested quotienting out by general subsets (defined to be quotienting out by the normal closure) and because I don't actually need normal subgroups per se, but rather quotient groups, this would also be good for me. </p>\n<p>I am completely happy if the answer is \"make a random choice and see how it works out\" but what I want to avoid is me refactoring <code>group_theory/quotient_group.lean</code> and then in the PR process someone saying \"you should have done it another way\". </p>\n<p>In fact maybe this is not even the right question!
