These are rather low-level classes wrapping around <code>has_scalar</code> and <code>smul</code>.<br>\nSomehow there is a very analogous theory for <code>has_pow</code> and <code>pow</code>. I haven't fleshed out the details. Somehow it is not as easy as a <code>to_additive</code>, because <code>pow</code> encodes an action on the right. I wonder whether it is useful to build some generic structure here that generalises all the <code>gpow</code>, <code>fpow</code>, <code>rpow</code> things that we currently have.<br>\nIt would be good if some clone of <code>to_additive</code> could do a bunch of lifting.</p>",
