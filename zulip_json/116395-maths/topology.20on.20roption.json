We already that an arbitrary function <code>f : X -&gt; roption Y</code> corresponds to a <code>S : set X</code> and a function <code>g : S -&gt; Y</code>. Then we could choose one of several conditions for <code>f</code> to be continuous, for example:<br>\n(a) <code>f</code> is continuous iff <code>g</code> is continuous;<br>\n(b) <code>f</code> is continuous iff <code>s</code> is open and <code>g</code> is continuous;<br>\n((c) <code>f</code> is continuous iff <code>s</code> is closed and <code>g</code> is continuous; I don't think this is at all useful for the application of defining manifolds, but the point is the list of options is open-ended...)<br>\nFor each of these options, there is at most one topology on <code>roption Y</code> making it hold (by the Yoneda lemma). Then we have a little exercise to determine whether the topology really exists and if so what it looks like.<br>\nThe point is that we're really going to use the fact (a)/(b) to work with this topology anyways--the exact construction of the topology is less important.</p>",
