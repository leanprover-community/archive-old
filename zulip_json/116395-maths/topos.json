I don't yet claim I have a convenient API for them yet, but I used only abstract category theory and topos theory to get this geometric result (that is, no ++ construction), and I've tried to express the result without using any topos theory at all. One cute curiosity here is that while I did use choice to make the special case of sheaves on a site, it suffices to only use unique choice - meaning that sheafification can be constructed using only unique choice.
