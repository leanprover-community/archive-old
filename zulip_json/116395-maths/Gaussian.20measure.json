But then he mentioned some work done at Dagstuhl on the Lebesgue integral which is...possibly not accessible at this point? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110049\">@Mario Carneiro</span> do you have access to this stuff and is it in any state to be made public? As Patrick has pointed out in the past, our analysis is weak in places, and this probably simply because us number theorists / geometers are working on our pet projects where a bunch of foundational stuff has been done already, whereas any potential analysts will soon discover that there are still gaps in the coverage of 1st year undergraduate analysis (did anyone do the product rule yet??).</p>",
