        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110050\">@Sebastien Gouezel</span>, it seems to me that it's easier to work with null measurable functions than with a.e. measurable functions. E.g., you can apply all theorems about measurable functions, and once we rewrite basic facts like <code>measure_union</code> for null measurable sets, we can prove other theorems (e.g., about integrals) for null measurable functions right away instead of the current approach (prove for measurable, use the definition of a.e. measurable).</p>\n<p>One difficulty I failed to overcome with a.e. measurable functions (disclaimer: it's 1:35 a.m. here, so possibly in fact it's not a hard issue) is to prove (or disprove) a version of <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/ae_measurable.add_measure\">docs#ae_measurable.add_measure</a> for a countable sum of measures. UPD: I can do it but it'll be much uglier than for <code>null_measurable</code>.</p>\n<p>AFAIR, the main argument pro a.e. measurable functions (besides the fact that we use them now) is that this way we can easily ensure that the coercion of an <code>ae_eq_fun</code> to a function is measurable. I suggest that we use the following trick: (a) ensure that it is measurable whenever possible (<code>if h : âˆƒ f (hf : measurable f), mk f hf.null_measurable = g then h.some else ...</code>) then prove <code>measurable_coe</code> whenever we're ready (probably in <code>simple_func_dense</code>). What do you think?</p>",
