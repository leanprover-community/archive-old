I mentioned this dream during FoMM2020 in Pittsburgh, but it has now started. You can read a first version  of the blueprint, either in <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/sphere-eversion/blueprint.pdf\">pdf</a> or <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/sphere-eversion/blueprint/sect0001.html\">online</a>, although the third chapter is currently pretty rough.</p>\n<p>Everybody is welcome to contribute. There is plenty to do, as you can see from <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/sphere-eversion/blueprint/dep_graph.html\">this graph</a> (read the legend and click nodes). The first two chapters are completely elementary, and contain enough material for publication in CPP or ITP.</p>",

There is one file that proves a rather general gluing lemma for <code>continuous_on</code>. The proof needs cleaning up (there is a big almost duplicate chunk in the middle) but we'll need the statement a lot in other places of the project. Then there is a file about path connected sets which is an easy application (the gluing lemma is used to concatenate paths). The main theme of this approach is to avoid subtypes everywhere. Every data is global and conditions are enforced only on subsets. I'm not yet fully convinced this is the way to go, but at least there is no coercion to fight (since coercions to functions now work). I hope this can get you unstuck on the way to the part you feel comfortable working on.</p>",

The goal was to prove that proof assistants are not limited to algebra and elementary analysis but can do differential geometry as well. The main team was made of Floris van Doorn, Oliver Nash and myself.
