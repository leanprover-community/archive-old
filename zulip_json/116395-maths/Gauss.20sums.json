The other one, <code>gauss_sum_mul_aux₂</code>, could be more useful. If it is made public, it should probably go into <code>add_character.lean</code> (and get a more descriptive name like <code>add_char.sum_mul</code>) , since it only involves an additive character.<br>\nOpinions? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"112680\">@Johan Commelin</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"310045\">@Eric Wieser</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110038\">@Kevin Buzzard</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"130384\">@Riccardo Brasca</span></p>",

If we want to guide users to the most interesting results in a file we should do it with big docstrings and a list of the main results in the file header. So even if a lemma is only useful in a specific situation we can just give it a name that won't cause clashes and leave it public</p>",
