As I get better at Lean I realise that I'm ranting less and just solving my own problems. But this one looks scary, because a finset is quite a complicated object for me -- I'm not sure I can steer <code>nodup</code> and I'm still quite an amateur when it comes to quotients. </p>\n<p>This is about the third post I've written about this problem; the first two I've written, thought \"actually I can make progress\", and then deleted. But this one still looks scary. Can anyone suggest a way to progress on this?</p>",
