While this approach is somewhat unusual for mathlib, I think it's the way to go: there are a lot of results that will need this condition, and carrying around a proof that an element is normal will be rather painful (for example, the continuous functional calculus, which lets us apply a function <code>f : ℂ → ℂ</code> to elements of a C⋆-algebra, only works for normal elements). Also, there is a relatively restricted set of instances that should be enough for most purposes: self-adjoint, unitary, and skew-adjoint elements are normal, zero and one are normal, and this already gets us pretty far.</p>\n<p>However, this style is still relatively uncommon for mathlib and it would be nice to have some input here about this before going ahead. I think it would be nice in particular to hear from the authors of <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/filter.ne_bot\">docs#filter.ne_bot</a> (git blame tells me this might be <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"214703\">@Yury G. Kudryashov</span>  or <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110049\">@Mario Carneiro</span> ...?) Are there any issues with this type class?</p>",

For example, maybe I have a class <code>is_real</code> on complex numbers, with instances like <code>is_real 0</code>, <code>[is_real x] [is_real y] : is_real (x + y)</code>, <code>[is_real x] : is_real (conj x)</code> and so on. You get a mini-grammar of all the operations you can put together to get real numbers, and it would be annoying to build up these proofs following the structure of the expression all the time. If there are no such structural operations, then typeclass inference is basically just a glorified <code>assumption</code> tactic, and passing the argument by any other way (e.g. by direct proof) becomes cumbersome.</p>",
