I'm removing <code>is_subgroup</code> from mathlib in a branch (and it's really good fun, it's got to the point where most of the refactoring is high-powered stuff and it's fun to fix the proofs). I tried replacing gpowers g with the subgroup closure of the singleton g, but the underlying set is now not defeq to the g^n and I'm constantly having to rewrite. How about I rename gpowers (the subgroup generated by g as a set) to gpowers.carrier and redefine gpowers g to be the subgroup, with carrier defeq to the powers of g? Is the set really more important than the subgroup?</p>",
