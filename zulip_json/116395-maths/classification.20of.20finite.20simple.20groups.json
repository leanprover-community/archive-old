Here is a blog post of my non-expert understanding of the classification as it relates to Lean: <a href=\"https://formalabstracts.wordpress.com/2019/01/14/the-journey-begins/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://formalabstracts.wordpress.com/2019/01/14/the-journey-begins/\">https://formalabstracts.wordpress.com/2019/01/14/the-journey-begins/</a>   </p>\n<p>My suggestion is to do the classification statement as a formal abstract.  What that means concretely is that it should be entirely compatible with Lean3 and mathlib, but with the \"cheat\" of  <code>axiom proof_omitted {A : Prop} : A</code> wherever needed, and where people stake reputation points on the correctness of props asserted by <code>proof_omitted</code>.  </p>\n<p>Some questions that would be helped by discussion before getting too far into it.<br>\n- Is the best path to affine varieties (over an algebraically closed field) through Kevin's general construction of schemes?  It is overkill, but perhaps the simplest way forward.<br>\n- Is there agreement about the approach sketched for the groups of Lie type?  In particular, about the choice of using Lie structure theory rather than concrete implementations of the groups through their faithful representations as matrix groups.  My preference is for a Lie structural approach.<br>\n- What counts as an acceptable specification of a finite simple group.  For instance, for the pariahs, can we say that they are specified by their order?<br>\n- What sanity checks can we produce that the definitions are correct?</p>",
