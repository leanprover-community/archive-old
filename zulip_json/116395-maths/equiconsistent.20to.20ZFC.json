That is to say, this is a <em>relative</em> consistency proof, of euclidean geometry relative to ZFC. Pretty much all consistency proofs are actually relative consistency proofs, but it means that you can convince your hypothetical friend not that euclidean geometry is consistent, but that if they doubt the consistency of euclidean geometry then they must also doubt the consistency of ZFC. (Usually this is still useful, since ZFC will generally be more studied than the theory being proven consistent, in this case euclidean geometry.)</p>",
