And the problem was precisely because I didn't know what definitional equality (defeq) meant. The idea is that sometimes you can prove <code>X = Y</code> by <code>rfl</code>, and sometimes you can't -- sometimes it's a theorem. For example if we define addition on the naturals by <code>a+0:=a</code> and <code>a+S(b):=S(a+b)</code> then <code>x+0=x</code> is true by definition, whereas to prove <code>0+x=x</code> you need to use induction on <code>x</code>. In the first example, if you simplify both things as much as you can, then you get <code>x=x</code>. Whereas <code>0+x</code> <em>cannot be simplified</em>; you have to split into the cases x=0 and x=successor before you can simplify the term further (so basically you have to apply the function <code>nat.rec</code>). So <code>0+x=x</code> but this is not true by definition; the terms are not defeq.</p>\n<p>Definitional equality is a super-powerful concept. I've proved [huge term] = [huge term] by <code>rfl</code> before. After a while it gets quite addictive -- if you make your definitions just right then there's more of a chance that <code>rfl</code> will work.</p>\n<p>The problem with </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"n\">def</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">u₁</span> <span class=\"n\">u₂</span> <span class=\"n\">v₁</span> <span class=\"n\">v₂</span><span class=\"o\">}</span> <span class=\"n\">prod</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">map</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">α₁</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span> <span class=\"n\">u₁</span><span class=\"o\">}</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">α₂</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span> <span class=\"n\">u₂</span><span class=\"o\">}</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">β₁</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span> <span class=\"n\">v₁</span><span class=\"o\">}</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">β₂</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span> <span class=\"n\">v₂</span><span class=\"o\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">f</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">α₁</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">α₂</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">g</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">β₁</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">β₂</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">α₁</span> <span class=\"bp\">×</span> <span class=\"n\">β₁</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">α₂</span> <span class=\"bp\">×</span> <span class=\"n\">β₂</span>\n<span class=\"bp\">|</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">f</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">g</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>is that the definition is by cases -- like the definition of <code>0 + x</code>. So <code>prod.map f g x</code> is never going to be defeq to anything other than more complicated things which reduce to it; you can't reduce it any further. The moment you say \"well x has type alpha x beta so WLOG it's of the form (a,b)\" you are applying a function, probably called something like prod.map.rec or prod.map.cases_on, and changing the term. <br>\nThis can be avoided by defining <code>prod.map f g x</code> to be <code>(f x.fst, g x.snd)</code>. Now we don't have to do cases on <code>x</code>, these things are equal by definition. </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>\n</pre></div>",
