We wanted to show an application of semilinear maps that were not linear or conjugate-linear. Heather suggested defining <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-crystal\">isocrystals</a> as a target that was in scope, given the Witt vector work. With some prodding and help from Johan and a random MathOverflow post, this turned into a proof of the dimension 1 case of the <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/isocrystal-pr/src/ring_theory/witt_vector/isocrystal.lean#L123\">Dieudonné–Manin classification theorem</a>. Essentially, the 1d case reduces to finding solutions to a sequence of recursively defined polynomials: the hard part is defining those polynomials in a way that we can show they have positive degree.</p>\n<p>The PR (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/12041\">#12041</a>) represents all I know about isocrystals and more. (Why do it? Because we can!) But Johan thought this was cool and I trust his taste here <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span> At some point we'll write up a blog post about this.</p>",
