It's so happy to see people want to contribute to this project. Now it's not provable yet, but we just need one more step to prove it. I did update something on parallelism but I forget to push to github. I just pushed them now and you can have a look. Parallelism is simply defined by two lines without intersections. I am now proving corresponding angles for parallel lines are equal. It's a result by contradiction and that exterior angles are larger than the interior. With this lemma we will be ready to prove the midpoint theorem.</p>",
