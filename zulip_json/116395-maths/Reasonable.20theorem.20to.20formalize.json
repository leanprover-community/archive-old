I won't have time any time soon to work on this, but since the theorem is fun I thought I would mention it here.</p>\n<p>Let <code>n</code> be an integer. Consider <code>4^n</code> points in the plane. Then you can find <code>n</code> of them which are in convex position (i.e., they are all on the boundary of their convex hull). This was proved by Erdös and Szekeres in 1935. But <code>4^n</code> is definitely not optimal. How better can you do? A lower bound <code>2^n</code> was found by Erdös in 1960, but there is huge gap between these bounds. Suk (J. Amer. Math. Soc. 30 (2017), 1047-1053) shows that <code>2^(n + o(n))</code> points are enough.</p>\n<p>You can try proving the theorem even without any nice bound, it's really fun!</p>",
