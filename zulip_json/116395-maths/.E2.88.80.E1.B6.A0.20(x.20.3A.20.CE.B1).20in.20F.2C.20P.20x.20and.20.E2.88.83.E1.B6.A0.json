So <code>f</code> is a \"filter on the truth values in <code>Type / X</code>\". Now there is a construction, called the filter-quotient construction in Mac Lane-Moerdijk, which gives you a new topos <code>Type / f</code> and a logical functor <code>Type / X -&gt; Type / f</code>, such that <code>p</code> becomes true in <code>Type / f</code> iff <code>∀ᶠ x in f, p x</code>.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>OK so how about this low-level interpretation of what you're saying:</p>\n<p>If P is a predicate on a set X (using the language of set theory rather than type theory), then we have \"forall x, P x\" and \"exists x, P x\", with all the usual lemmas about them. If S is a subset of X then we also have \"forall x in S, P x\" and \"exists x in S, P x\". As a mathematician I might regard this generalisation as useless because I may as well just replace X with S. However if we keep X in mind then instead of using S we can use the principal filter P(S) on S. and then \"forall x in S, P x\" just becomes \"forall^f x in P(S), P x\" and the same for exists. A general filter gives us some more general expression, so I can think of filters as somehow \"generalised subsets of X\". I'm assuming that if f is principal P(S) then this filter-quotient construction is just isomorphic to some kind of restriction Type / X -&gt; Type / S (I am guessing that there is a morphism of topoi because I can see maps in both directions). In this optic the idea is that I can use filters to focus my attention on concepts such as \"points of X\" which aren't actually points, e.g. I can look at what is happening for various concepts of \"near infinity\" even if X doesn't contain an actual point called infinity, and this forall / exists stuff is just some formalisation of \"truth near infinity\".</p>",
