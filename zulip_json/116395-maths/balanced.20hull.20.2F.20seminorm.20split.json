If I remember correctly there was a consensus to that this file is already large enough and might be ripe for splitting up. I don't remember whether that was before the gauge part left or after. So my question is whether we should split <code>seminorm</code>further or just put the balanced hull/core stuff in a new file  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"387244\">@Yaël Dillies</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"260507\">@Heather Macbeth</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"246273\">@Bhavik Mehta</span></p>",

My suggestion is still <code>analysis.locally_convex</code> not because everything is locally convex, but all the topics are related and used for locally convex spaces. There is also the possibility to make a folder (something like) <code>analysis.module</code> for topics about modules over normed fields/rings. The later is probably more in line with the rest of the naming convention of mathlib.</p>",
