One <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1515/9781400876709-002\">elementary proof</a> due to Nevanlinna with this regularity condition does seem approachable, as most of the tools it uses are available in mathlib. However, the proof also relies heavily on solving the differential equations derived from an equation about the inner product of differentials applied on pairs of orthogonal vectors (and also the transcendence of log and arctan functions).</p>\n<p>I was wondering if there is a route/argument one can take to bypass the differential equations, or if there exists a more general/abstract linear algebra statement on the differentials of conformal maps that can be used to prove this theorem. Due to my limited understanding of the general picture, I failed to locate any relevant materials or possible solutions. I would be extremely grateful for any input. Thanks in advance.</p>",
