        "content": "<p>Friends,</p>\n<p>I apologize in advance for this long post. For various projects, I am going to need a good library for multivariate analysis. At minimum, I want to be able to reason about systems of differential equations and dynamical systems on R^n, optimization problems in R^n, etc. The general idea is to look for ways to make Lean and ITP useful for working on problems in applied mathematics. (In the long run, it would be great to have complex analysis, measure theory, optimization on function spaces, stochastic calculus, differential geometry, etc., etc. But the plan is to start small and try to find some compelling prototype applications rather than focus exclusively on building general theory.)</p>\n<p>Two examples of the sort of thing it would be good to have are these:</p>\n<p>(1) Some of Fabian Immler's very nice work on the dynamical systems background to the numeric calculations related to the Lorenz attractor. (The first paper on his web page is an excellent survey: <a href=\"http://home.in.tum.de/~immler/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://home.in.tum.de/~immler/\">http://home.in.tum.de/~immler/</a>)</p>\n<p>(2) Damien Rouhling's very nice formalization of a solution to the inverted pendulum problem (<a href=\"https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01639819\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01639819\">https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01639819</a>) based on the mathcomp library and prior work with Cyril Cohen (<a href=\"https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01612293\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01612293\">https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01612293</a>). </p>\n<p>So I can use the Isabelle and mathcomp libraries as a model.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/browser_info/current/AFP/Ordinary_Differential_Equations/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/browser_info/current/AFP/Ordinary_Differential_Equations/index.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/browser_info/current/AFP/Ordinary_Differential_Equations/index.html</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/math-comp/analysis\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/math-comp/analysis\">https://github.com/math-comp/analysis</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/drouhling/LaSalle\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/drouhling/LaSalle\">https://github.com/drouhling/LaSalle</a></p>\n<p>Lots of things in that are already in the Lean library will be helpful: topological, limits, polynomials, matrices, the transcendental functions, normed spaces, and Johannes' work on integration. As far as I can tell, these are the things I should work on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Frechet derivative, defined in general for functions between normed vector spaces</li>\n<li>The spaces R^n as instances, connections between linear maps and matrices, polynomials and their derivatives, etc.</li>\n<li>ODE's and the Picard-Lindel√∂f theorem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am planning to work on this on a fork in my repository but push to a branch of leanprover-community/mathlib often, whenever things look decent.</p>\n<p>As usual, lots of little questions and design decisions will arise, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>how much to bundle (e.g. (f : real -&gt; real) [bounded f] [continous f] or (f : bounded_continuous_function R R))</li>\n<li>how much to use type classes for</li>\n<li>how to restrict to subdomains (continuous_on f s) or (continuous (restrict f s))</li>\n<li>how to handle partial functions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I will experiment and raise specific questions here as they come up.</p>\n<p>Here is the reason for this long post:</p>\n<p>(1) If any of you have advice, suggestions, requests, etc. please let me know.</p>\n<p>(2) If any of you are working on related things, or plan to work on related things, please let me know so that we can coordinate and avoid duplication.</p>\n<p>In particular, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110031\">@Patrick Massot</span> , Mario pointed me your differential topology repo.

        "content": "<p>Here's a little report on some things I learned about limits, filters, and set-valued functions this weekend.</p>\n<p>Suppose we want to formalize the notion of a limit, and say <code>f x</code> approaches something as <code>x</code> approaches something. The problem is that there are lots of variations on the \"somethings\" -- <code>x</code> can approach a value or infinity or negative infinity, or it can approach a value from the left or the right, etc. </p>\n<p>The solution (described here <a href=\"http://home.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/~hoelzl/html-data/documents/hoelzl2013typeclasses.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://home.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/~hoelzl/html-data/documents/hoelzl2013typeclasses.pdf\">http://home.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/~hoelzl/html-data/documents/hoelzl2013typeclasses.pdf</a> and implemented by Johannes in <code>order/filter.lean</code>) is to write down a general relation <code>tendsto f l1 l2</code>, where <code>l1</code> and <code>l2</code> are filters. The relation <code>tendsto f l1 l2</code> asserts that the preimage of any set in <code>l2</code> under <code>f</code> is an element of <code>l1</code>. Instantiating <code>l1</code>, for example, with the filter of neighborhoods of a point <code>a</code>, we have convergence as <code>x</code> approaches <code>a</code>.</p>\n<p>One issue that comes up when doing ordinary calculus is that often we want to restrict attention to a subset of the domain. Think of all the theorems about a function <code>f</code> that is continuous or differentiable on a closed interval <code>[a, b]</code>. When assessing continuity at <code>a</code>, we want to ignore anything outside the interval. The filter technology gives a means of doing this; replacing <code>l1</code> by <code>inf l1 (principal s)</code> restricts the domain to <code>s</code>. The Isabelle library proves all the basic theorems with such restrictions. Replacing <code>s</code> by <code>univ</code> results in the unqualified version.</p>\n<p>Mario pointed out to me that sometimes, when working with an interval <code>[a, b]</code>, it is more natural to work with a partial function <code>f</code> on that domain, rather than a total function taking arbitrary values. He has defined <code>data/pfun.lean</code> for that purpose. Working with it is rather pleasant; you write <code>y ‚àà f x</code> to say that <code>f</code> is defined at <code>x</code> and equal to <code>y</code>.</p>\n<p>The relation <code>tendsto</code> generalizes to a relation <code>ptendsto</code> for partial functions, and if we define <code>res f s</code> to be the restriction of a total function <code>f</code> to a partial function with domain <code>s</code>, we have</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>tendsto f (l‚ÇÅ ‚äì principal s) l‚ÇÇ ‚Üî ptendsto (pfun.res f s) l‚ÇÅ l‚ÇÇ\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Here both sides say that <code>f</code> tends to <code>l‚ÇÇ</code> along <code>l‚ÇÅ</code> when the domain is restricted to <code>s</code>, but they say it is different ways: the lhs restricts the filter, and the rhs restricts the function. We recover the usual notion of convergence when <code>s</code> is <code>univ</code>, so in a sense working with partial functions is more general, and it avoids the need to mention <code>s</code> explicitly everywhere.</p>\n<p>There is a catch, however. When generalizing the <code>tendsto</code> relation, one has to generalize the notion of a <code>preimage</code> to partial functions. Here there are two choices for the preimage of <code>f</code> on <code>s</code>: we can define it as <code>{x | ‚àÉ a ‚àà f x, a ‚àà s}</code> or <code>{x | ‚àÄ a ‚àà f x, a ‚àà s}</code>. The first one may seem more natural, but it is the second one, which basically adds all the values outside the domain of <code>f</code> to the first, which gives the equivalence above.</p>\n<p>The plot thickens. In set-valued analysis, one further generalizes partial functions to \"set-valued functions,\" which map a value <code>x</code> to a set of values -- possibly the empty set, possibly a singleton, and possibly lots of values. A set-valued function from <code>Œ±</code> to <code>Œ≤</code> is really just a relation, but thinking of it as a multi-valued function suggests natural and useful generalizations of definitions and theorems in ordinary analysis, as described in this classic book: <a href=\"https://www.springer.com/la/book/9780817648473\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.springer.com/la/book/9780817648473\">https://www.springer.com/la/book/9780817648473</a>.</p>\n<p>Here is the kicker: both versions of <code>preimage</code> suggested above generalize to relations, and both are considered in set-valued analysis:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>def rel (Œ± : Type*) (Œ≤ : Type*):= Œ± ‚Üí Œ≤ ‚Üí Prop\n\nnamespace rel\n\nvariable (r : rel Œ± Œ≤)\n\ndef preimage (s : set Œ≤) := {x | ‚àÉ y ‚àà s, r x y}\n\ndef core (s : set Œ≤) := {x | ‚àÄ y, r x y ‚Üí y ‚àà s}\n\nend rel\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>They give rise to two different notations of convergence. When talking about sequences of sets, the two notions are called \"liminf\" and \"limsup\". When used to define continuity of set-valued functions, we get \"lower semicontinuity\" and \"upper continuity\". </p>\n<p>I implemented the general notions of convergence as <code>rtendsto</code> and <code>rtendsto'</code> in this file: <a href=\"https://github.com/avigad/mathlib/blob/multivariate/analysis/multivariate/limit.lean\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/avigad/mathlib/blob/multivariate/analysis/multivariate/limit.lean\">https://github.com/avigad/mathlib/blob/multivariate/analysis/multivariate/limit.lean</a>. (Here the \"r\" is for relation.) At the very end, both versions are easily shown to be equivalent to <code>tendsto</code> in the function case, but in general, the two notions are different. In the case of a partial function, the definition is easily shown to be equivalent to <code>ptendsto</code> as defined above.</p>\n<p>The bottom line: it seems to me that the fundamental notions of convergence we use should the be relational (set-valued) versions. They strictly generalize the cases of functions and partial functions, but it seems they are no harder to work with. I am inclined to stick with the general versions until there is good reason to specialize, and then to stick with partial functions unless/until there is good reason to restrict to functions.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110294\">@Johannes H√∂lzl</span> , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110049\">@Mario Carneiro</span> , what do you think?</p>",

One way of thinking about <code>option A</code> in classical maths is that it's the set of subsets of <code>A</code> of size at most 1 (so it's <code>A</code> plus one extra element, here modelled as the empty set). A partial function <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>‚Üí</mo><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">A\\to B</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68333em;\"></span><span class=\"strut bottom\" style=\"height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"mord mathit\">A</span><span class=\"mrel\">‚Üí</span><span class=\"mord mathit\" style=\"margin-right:0.05017em;\">B</span></span></span></span> is just a function <code>A -&gt; option B</code> (they use <code>roption</code> but I am too blinded by 30 years of classical mathematics to understand the difference properly) and the interpretation of <code>option B</code> as subsets of size at most 1 explains the observation Jeremy refers to as pleasant (and indeed it is pleasant). The \"catch\" Jeremy is talking about comes from the fact that with subsingletons (sets of size at most 1) the difference between exists and forall is that the empty set works with forall but not exists. </p>\n<p>This subtlety that Jeremy has uncovered (choosing exists or forall when defining preimage) leads to there being two natural ways to do some things at this hugely abstract level, and he's observing that these two choices give rise to things like liminf and limsup. If you had asked me about this stuff last year I would have said \"oh I'm sure it's all in Bourbaki somewhere\" but I am genuinely now wondering if this is actually new mathematics. Can anyone here come up with some dusty old book from the 70s where it's all done like this to show these computer science people that they're re-inventing the wheel?

For you the theory of filters on a type is some beautiful tool which can help you to make other stuff. I don't think we attach much value to that theory at all. I think it's cool but if you ask me if it's in Bourbaki I would just say I don't know and don't really care, I'm sure it all works great and let's get on with the good stuff. I attach value to the Riemann Hypothesis, some random statement about the zeros of some completely randomly-defined function which is a pain to formalise because it involves analytic continuation but which at the end of the day is no different to any other function really, and the main point seems to be just that humans are worse at finding the zeros for that Riemann function than for some other functions like the identity function.</p>",

CMU's library has an electronic copy, and I'd be glad to share it with you.<br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"111080\">@Floris van Doorn</span> If you Google around a bit, you'll see that the notion of a set-valued function gets used quite a lot in various branches of applied mathematics. For example, it is used to generalize differential questions to cases where instead of having a unique trajectory you only have some bounds on the possible evolutions of the system (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_inclusion\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_inclusion\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_inclusion</a>, <a href=\"https://bookstore.ams.org/gsm-41\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://bookstore.ams.org/gsm-41\">https://bookstore.ams.org/gsm-41</a>). It is used in optimization problems, where a given parameterized problem can have multiple optimum values (<a href=\"https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783642542640\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783642542640\">https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783642542640</a>). It is used in nonsmooth convex analysis to generalize the derivative to the case where there can be multiple \"tangent lines\" beneath a curve (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subderivative\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subderivative\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subderivative</a>, <a href=\"https://www.degruyter.com/view/product/467711\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.degruyter.com/view/product/467711\">https://www.degruyter.com/view/product/467711</a>). <br>\nBy the way, I think branches of applied mathematics like these are good targets for interactive theorem proving: not only is there a lot of symbolic and numeric computation, but the models tend to be complicated and unruly, and one can imagine that a interactive system can help people reason about them rigorously.<br>\nThat said, my goal isn't to do any of that right away, only develop the notions of limit in as great a generality as conveniently possible while heading toordinary (function-based) analysis.<br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110038\">@Kevin Buzzard</span>  I wrote down the notion of a preimage that would make the theorem go through, and I was delighted to find essentially that notion in the book, at least in the particular setting they treat there. I don't think it is radically new or deep mathematics, but it is a nice was of organizing and unifying concepts. This happens a lot with formalization, and I am glad that you find it an interesting and valuable aspect of the whole business.</p>",

However, when you do Frechet derivatives you can also write this as <code>f(x+h) = f(x) + Df(x) h + o(h)</code> (where by <code>o(h)</code> I mean the norm of <code>h</code> multiplied by a function which tends to 0 at 0).

First, when you are working with relations, it is a lot more pleasant to write <code>rel Œ± Œ≤</code> than to write <code>Œ± ‚Üí Œ≤ ‚Üí Prop</code> repeatedly, and it is pleasant to be able to write <code>r.image</code>, <code>r.preimage</code>, <code>r.dom</code>, <code>r.codom</code>, etc. (So much so that I started withing that Lean had the convention that function types were implictly associated to the <code>function</code> namespace, so we could write <code>f.image</code>, <code>f.preimage</code>, etc. I have decided that I don't really like the <code>f '' s</code> and <code>f ‚Åª¬π' s</code> notation, and I will start favoring <code>s.image</code> or <code>set.image f s</code> unless someone talks me out of it.) </p>\n<p>I don't feel strongly that the library needs a calculus for relations, and I wouldn't mind keeping it in reserve until a compelling need arises. But if we do have one, I think <code>rel</code> is the way to go. So, if there are no objections, I'll follow Mario's suggestion and make it a lattice instance and prepare it for the library.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Setting aside the puncturing issue for a moment, I'll remind readers that <code>at_within a s</code> is basically just <code>nds a ‚äì principal s</code>. The point is that we want to say \"f is differentiable on [a, b]\" where \"differentiable at a\" is independent of what f does outside the interval. As far as I can tell, there are three options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use \"at_within\" to restrict the domain of interest.</li>\n<li>Lift f to a subtype, and make the statement about the subtype.</li>\n<li>Restrict f to [a,b] to get a partial function, and make the statement about the partial function.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am most hopeful about the first approach. In my experience with Isabelle, it was easy, intuitive, and natural to relativize statements to sets. But my plan is to support all three in the library and prove equivalences, so we can try all the different approaches and go with whatever works best. </p>\n<p>As far as subtypes, packing and unpacking information can be a royal pain in the neck, and for many purposes, like taking intersections or translating sets, we really want [a, b] to be a subset rather than a subtype. Also, as Mario pointed out to me, for some purposes it doesn't work: to define the derivative, we need a subtraction on the domain, and you don't get that if you restrict to a subtype.</p>\n<p>Mario seems to think that the third approach will prove the most useful. I am not yet convinced, but I added all the pfun stuff to support it. To see what I am concerned about, take a look at the definition of the Frechet derivative, and now imagine what has to change if f is a partial function. All the operations on the codomain -- addition, substraction, scalar multiplication, the norm -- have to be lifted to partial functions as well. I am not convinced that it will be possible to do all the calculations in a reasonable way, even with some monad trickery, and that it will be worth it.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, as I said, my plan is to develop the infrastructure and give it a try as long as it does not make progress too painful.</p>",
