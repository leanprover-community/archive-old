Some ZFC people don't like that (because the existence of a universe implies the existence of a set satisfying the axioms of ZFC, which implies ZFC is consistent, so by Goedel we deduce that we cannot prove the existence of universes in ZFC). People like de Jong have written down in the Stacks project the way that ZFC people can carefully get around issues such as cohomology of a sheaf on the etale site being defined as a limit over a class. Other mathematicians simply don't care about these issues. My belief is that these other mathematicians are secretly using different foundations, because they think that all this kappa-cutoff stuff is boring and regard it as a deficiency of ZFC foundations. Grothendieck thought like this. He wanted to do mathematics, and if ZFC didn't let him do the mathematics he wanted then he was just going to do it anyway and in his mind this said more about ZFC than the theory of sheaves on a site.</p>",

To do etale sheaves you need to know about sheafification on sites (not just on top spaces like we needed in the schemes project).

In example 7.10.2 we discover that in the stacks project, the objects of a category form a set, so the limits are not problematic but we deduce that it must be the categories which are problematic, because the objects in the category of schemes for sure do not form a set. De Jong gives a very precise definition of site <a href=\"https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00VG\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00VG\">here</a> and then he remarks that this differs from the SGA4 definition. This is a great example of mathematicians meaning different things by the same words, and because the details here are technical and boring and \"not mathematics\" or \"not proper mathematics\", we just claim that the logicians sorted all this out ages ago, even though I am not sure how many logicians are reading SGA4. I do know some who have looked at this. However I don't know any who are looking at Scholze's work which needs infinity categories and all the same questions are there.</p>",
