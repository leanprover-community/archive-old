The description of a directed system as a functor would be inaccurate without this condition. And you wouldn't be able to show that if <code>ι</code> has a greatest element then the direct limit is the corresponding 'last' object. (Effectively, if you remove the <code>map_self</code> condition, then each object comes equipped with an idempotent endomorphism, and the limit will quotient each object by the kernel of this endomorphism)</p>",
