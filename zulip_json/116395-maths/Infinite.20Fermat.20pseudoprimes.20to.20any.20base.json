I was wondering if the definition for pseudoprime was set up correctly. A textbook I have states that n being coprime with b is a requirement for n to be pseudoprime, but other sources don't seem to include this requirement.<br>\nAdditionally, because <code>probable_prime</code> was defined using divisibility instead of congruences, all numbers are probable primes to base 0 and 1, and 0 and 1 are probable primes to any base.<br>\nThis definition for pseudoprime also permits a few pseudoprimes that might be considered trivial. For example, all composite numbers are pseudoprimes to base 1, and 4 is pseudoprime to base 5.</p>\n<p>A few other questions I had were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Should the order of the parameters n and b be swapped? Currently <code>fermat_psp 341 2</code> means 341 is a pseudoprime to base 2 but I can see the advantages of swapping them.</li>\n<li>Would it have been better to have used modular arithmetic instead of divisibility in the definition?</li>\n<li>My proof contains a variety of lemmas which are unrelated to pseudoprimes. Where should I place them?</li>\n<li><code>psp_from_prime</code>, <code>psp_from_prime_psp</code>, and <code>psp_from_prime_gt_p</code> are all marked private because I didn't think they had much use outside of proving <code>exists_infinite_pseudoprimes</code>. Should they be marked private?</li>\n</ul>",

        "content": "<p>Whether you want n to be coprime with b might depend on whether you're using b^(n-1)-1 or b^n-b. I can believe that there is inconsistency, you might just want to go with whatever it says on Wikipedia. The definition wasn't really designed for edge cases, I wouldn't worry too much about what happens when b is small. People are going to complain if 341 isn't a pseudoprime base 2 but nobody is going to complain if your edge cases are a bit different to their edge cases because it's not the point of the definition. I think the order is fine, it's the order that they are in when we say the phrase in English. For definitions, you reap what you sew. If you've got your definition working then I wouldn't worry. If you want the definition to be equivalent to a statement using modular arithmetic then just prove that statement and give a docstring explaining why it's there.</p>",
