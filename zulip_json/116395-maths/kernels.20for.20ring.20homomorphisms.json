They are not implemented for ring homs, but you would define them exactly the same as is done for linear maps (in linear_algebra.basic). I cannot easily reuse the one for linear maps as a ring homomorphism is not necessarily a linear map of modules. However, all the basic properties of the kernel of a linear map (and ring hom) only depend on the underlying additive group stucture. One could define a kernel of a group_hom and then the kernel (pullback) can be lifted.</p>\n<p>I was wondering if there are any reasons for not making linear_map and ring_hom extend group_hom (which would be needed to be defined as only is_group_hom is defined now). This could be done for a lot of these algebraic structures which extend each other, but it could maybe be a bit cumbersome. So I wanted to know some of your opinions about this.</p>",
