This number is huge the same way Graham's number is huge: it is numerically very large, but its description is relatively compact. Since you usually aren't working from scratch in lean anyway, but are building up a language as you go, it's perfectly reasonable to get \"explicit and comprehensible\" by judicious use of sensibly named definitions while still producing a numerically huge result.
