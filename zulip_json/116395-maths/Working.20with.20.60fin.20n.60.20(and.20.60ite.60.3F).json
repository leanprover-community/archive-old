You want to model certain things (e.g. R^n) and there are several equivalent ways of doing it (e.g. lists of length n, \"vector n\", or an inductive definition). My impression is that it's a bit of a dark art to see which definition is \"best\". As mathematicians we regard all these definitions as trivially equivalent, and indeed are capable of switching between various ways of thinking about one underlying idea without ever even fussing about the details, because we all know how to switch. In this game, every time you switch then all of a sudden the lemma or definition you had in one of the contexts becomes unavailable and you either end up writing infrastructure which will help you to switch between the notions, or (and my impression is that this is what the CS people advocate) deciding what the \"best\" way to do it is (you see that this is the question Johannes raises -- it is far far more important for CS people than for maths people) and writing everything for this decision and then writing the functions which translate to and from other situations.</p>",
