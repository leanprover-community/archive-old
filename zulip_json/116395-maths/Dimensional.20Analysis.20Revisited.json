        "content": "<p>Hello,<br>\nI posted a month of so back about a first attempt at <a href=\"#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Dimensional.20Analysis.20Community.20Input\">formalizing dimensional analysis</a> with an end goal of automating the process of showing dimensional homogeneity. After applying the feedback I recieved, I am happy to show the second iteration of dimensional analysis. The full set of files can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/ATOMSLab/LeanChemicalTheories/blob/dimensional-analysis-new-formulation/src/dimensional_analysis/basic2.lean\">here</a>. Instead of using <code>inductive</code> I switched to structure to index the exponent and swapped to a general n-tuple.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">structure</span> <span class=\"n\">dimension</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span>\n<span class=\"n\">mk</span> <span class=\"o\">::</span>\n<span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">exponent</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"bp\">Π</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ℕ</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">fin</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">rat</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I believe using structure is the correct approach over class, but I wanted to make sure. With this, I could easily define a dimensionless number as:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">def</span> <span class=\"n\">dimensionless</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">dimension.mk</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"bp\">λ</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ℕ</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">fin</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"o\">),</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ℚ</span><span class=\"o\">))</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>but I was having trouble with defining dimensions. For instance, I want to define <code>time</code> as being a tuple of 1 followed by zeros. Ideally, I would like the number of zeros to be as many as needed. So if I'm talking about the seven common dimensions, its just 1 and six 0s, but if I have more dimensions, it's more zeros to fill the gap. I was looking for any suggestions on how to achieve this. </p>\n<p>I also formalized the basis of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_%CF%80_theorem\">buckingham pi</a> as:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">noncomputable</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">def</span> <span class=\"n\">number_of_dimensionless_parameters</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">m</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ℕ</span><span class=\"o\">}</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">M</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">matrix</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">fin</span> <span class=\"n\">m</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">fin</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"n\">ℚ</span><span class=\"o\">):</span> <span class=\"n\">ℕ</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"bp\">-</span> <span class=\"n\">matrix.rank</span> <span class=\"n\">M</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Once I can define the dimensions, I can create an example of using them with the buckingham pi theorem. I was trying to do a quick example to check if it works</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">example</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">number_of_dimensionless_parameters</span> <span class=\"bp\">!!</span><span class=\"o\">[(</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ℚ</span><span class=\"o\">),</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"bp\">;</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"bp\">-</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"o\">]</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>but I wasn't entirely sure how to compute the rank of a matrix. I was worried that because <code>matrix.rank</code> has the noncomputable tag, it would be impossible to show, for this example, the rank is 2. </p>\n<p>A final note, I was trying to use the <code>option</code> class for addition, but may have done it wrong, because its not of the correct function form when trying to do instances like <code>has_add</code>.</p>\n<p>With these problems solved, we should have a dimensional analysis system that can achieve what wolfram alpha can achieve (besides constructing the dimensionless numbers), but in a formally verified environment, which would be awesome. Also, sympy has a dimensional analysis program that can pull equations directly from wikidata and we are looking at setting up a similar automation so we can automatically check the dimensional homogeneity of all the equations in wikidata.</p>",

However, my thought process along with comments from my previous post, was the n-tuple is the tuple of the dimension exponents, where n signifies the number of dimensions that exists. Commonly it's taken as 7, but you could have more by accounting for other things like a currency dimension. In this case, we define length to be the exponent in the first spot of the tuple, mass to be the second, time the third, and so on. So while you can't talk about time, without having the spot exist for length, the spot for length can be zero. For applications with Buckingham pi, we want to be able to construct a matrix of the exponents of a set of dimensions. For instance</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"bp\">!</span><span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">velocity.exponent</span><span class=\"bp\">^</span><span class=\"n\">T</span><span class=\"o\">,</span><span class=\"n\">distance.exponent</span><span class=\"bp\">^</span><span class=\"n\">T</span><span class=\"o\">]</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>which corresponds to the matrix</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span>\n <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span>\n <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"o\">],</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>so, while mass does appear in this matrix, it's just a row of zeros and doesn't change the rank.

To double check I understand, your <code>si_dimension_system</code> class is like the <code>has_add</code> class and is used to show that <code>your_system</code> and <code>my_system</code> are both talking about the same <code>length</code>, <code>mass</code>, and <code>time</code>? That way we can define properties about the <code>si_dimension_system</code> class and then implement those properties for the <code>system</code>? Would it make sense to split up the <code>si_dimension_system```` class into multiple classes, like </code>has_length<code>, </code>has_mass```, etc? I was wondering if that way is better so that later, a new dimension can be added without disrupting the classes.</p>",
