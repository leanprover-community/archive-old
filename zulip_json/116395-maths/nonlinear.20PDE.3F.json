        "content": "<p>Hello, I am working in mathematicial analyis, hyperbolic non-linear PDE to be precise and therefore I have little knowledge of formal proof checkers. (More than 10 years ago I looked a bit into Isabelle but forgot almost everything). I learned about lean in an article about the successful confirmation of a proof of Peter Scholze. So I am curious, sometimes proofs for showing global existence for (classical) solutions of non-linear PDE can be quite sophisticated. Is there any project, any material, in lean trying to provide support for these sort of questions? What I have found so far only concerned, logic, set theory, etc but not really analysis. Can anybody enlighten me please. Regards Uwe Brauer</p>",

So I share many of your long-term hopes for formalization.</p>\n<p>Lean (and other formal proof checkers) are a long way away from being able to do this.  At the moment we are doing much more foundational work that heads in that direction -- for example, Remy Degenne contributed a theory of Lp spaces a few months ago, then last month I proved that continuous functions are dense in Lp.  An expert user could probably write down a <em>definition</em> of Sobolev spaces now, but it would be a fair bit of work.</p>",
