I started proving that products exists in my category since I thought proving limits exists directly would be annoying. So to prove limits exist I should only need to show that pullbacks exists (and possibly proving that products + pullbacks imply that limits exist if its not already in mathlib). Is this an \"ok\" method? Would there be much to gain from me proving that limits exists \"explictly\", like how in the category of topological spaces we have \"Top.limit_cone\"? Otherwise I might just do pullbacks because that seems like a much simpler case to me (and also products is already there).</p>",
