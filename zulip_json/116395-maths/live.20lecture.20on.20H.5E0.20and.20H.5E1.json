It has been a joy to code up this stuff, there is a very principled way of doing it involving coercions to functions which makes everything very clean. I even put a README up <a href=\"https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/formalising-mathematics/tree/master/src/week_8\">here</a> explaining a bit more about what's going on.</p>",
