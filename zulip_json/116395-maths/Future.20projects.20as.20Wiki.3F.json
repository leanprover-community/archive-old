I am wondering whether this could be in the mathlib wiki? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110032\">@Reid Barton</span> also described to me a small mathlib-appropriate project which he didn't have time to do but which he had turned into a coherent roadmap (in particular he felt that he had found the correct way of setting up the theory, and was concerned that if someone else tried it without having put the same amount of thought into planning then there was a risk that they would set things up in a worse way). Would the wiki pages be appropriate for roadmaps?</p>",
