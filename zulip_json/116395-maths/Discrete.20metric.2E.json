It feels like I should automatically get this by using the L_p norm - but for that I need a norm on zmod 2, and the only sensible one is the discrete metric. I realised we didn't actually have this... at all? And so I had a go at it. It's been pointed out to me, though, that these instances aren't safe because they too easily push the instance search into loops.</p>\n<p>I was wondering if anyone had any advice on what the right approach would be?</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">namespace</span> <span class=\"n\">discrete</span>\n\n<span

I don't see why <code>normed_field</code> has to exist at all - one could imagine a version of <code>normed_ring</code> (<code>valuation_ring</code>, which surely is a thing?) with the current = axiom. Indeed I'm not even sure about <code>normed_ring</code> - that also is very strong. When doing the Hamming distance work separately from the typeclass hierarchy yesterday, I realised that you don't need very much at all to define it... (mul_zero_class was strong enough, right?)</p>\n<p>Having spent some time yesterday looking at this I'm very sceptical of the hierarchy here... I'm not very experienced with the typeclass system but something smells off, is the best way I can put it. It feels like you want a typeclass that captures the precise axiom that the norm is compatible with the metric. I appreciate one wants to avoid diamonds very strongly, but - basically I think something is Up with the current definitions. I'm sorry that's not more specific - this isn't my specific areas of maths and there's so so many definitions and classes here it's hard to visualise, but maybe that's part of the issue.</p>\n<p>Also, field seems too strong in the definition of <code>normed_space</code>. Why isn't a <code>normed_module</code> a coherent definition? You see the issue really - there's lots of algebraic structures that it seems like you could sensibly attach a norm to - and (appreciating this gets away from my original question somewhat) I'm just sceptical of our current approach. I don't know the best way to work out if I'm correct or to review this stuff - in general I would prefer if every time I touched mathlib I didn't fall down a rabbit hole, but such a thing doesn't appear to be my destiny.</p>",
