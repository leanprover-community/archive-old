I would really appreciate help (from Mario, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110294\">@Johannes HÃ¶lzl</span> or anyone else) with understanding how one should setup the instance maze (or use definitions instead of instances) to be able to finish <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/completions/analysis/topology/group_completion.lean#L161\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/completions/analysis/topology/group_completion.lean#L161\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/completions/analysis/topology/group_completion.lean#L161</a> (assume I can prove <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/completions/analysis/topology/group_completion.lean#L124\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/completions/analysis/topology/group_completion.lean#L124\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/completions/analysis/topology/group_completion.lean#L124</a>). I'd be ready to have the uniform space structure on a topological group to be outside the type class system, especially since we would ideally also like to handle non-commutative groups at some point, and those have two natural uniform structures. But I don't know how to use them if there are not instances (everything else uses instance implicit arguments).</p>",
