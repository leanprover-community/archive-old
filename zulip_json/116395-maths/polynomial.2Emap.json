Is there any reason this is not a semiring hom? I was trying to remove a deprecated import; the issue is <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/de46349366376fe12530dc56a99244a7ca405cae/src/data/polynomial/eval.lean#L398\">map.is_semiring_hom</a>, the \"old-fashioned\" proof (i.e. just what we need to make the semiring hom). I don't know my way around polynomials, I just know it's moved fast recently. Do people really use this <code>map</code>? I don't know how to search for it. Searching directly for <code>polynomial.map</code> finds only four uses in mathlib, but I'm aware there could be more.</p>",
