Now that Krein-Milman hit mathlib, I was reading more of Barry Simon, Convexity, and I thought that Brunn-Minkowski would be a very nice statement to formalize. Then I read that it implied the isoperimetric inequality (the sphere maximizes volume among shapes of fixed surface area) rather directly, which is one of the last three standing items on Freek's list! Hence I was wondering whether the isoperimetric inequality/Brunn-Minkowski was within reach from the mathlib measure theory side of things.</p>",
