This question may not really be too formalization related, so apologies if it belongs more elsewhere --</p>\n<p>In this podcast episode: at around 14 minutes <a href=\"https://kpknudson.com/my-favorite-theorem/2021/1/15/episode-62-tai-danae-bradley\">https://kpknudson.com/my-favorite-theorem/2021/1/15/episode-62-tai-danae-bradley</a> the speaker is talking about a sort of category theory-ish interpretation or connection with the singular value decomposition from linear algebra, but I can't quite get enough googleable words to figure out where to read about what she's talking about. In particular I guess I want to know specifically what she means when she says that the property you want to preserve when multiplying (at 16:10) is not linearity and instead has something to do with the set structure, but she doesn't say what it is. Any suggestion on what to read for more detail?</p>\n<p>(I know negative amounts of information about category theory other than basic definitions...)</p>",
