        "content": "<p>To chose a good upper approximation, I computed the continued fraction expansion of <code>81 * exp(8 * ln 2/21) / 4</code> and truncated it to some terms. To figure out the 8, I tried first with 5 but it failed, then 6, then 7, then 8, and it succeeded. Simple enough :) For another numerical approximation in the same file, I had to go up to <code>approximation 17</code> (which I found by dichotomoy), but the proof is still almost instantaneous. That's a wonderful tool! (If I had to give a proof by hand, it would be super-tedious and certainly 100 lines long...)</p>",
