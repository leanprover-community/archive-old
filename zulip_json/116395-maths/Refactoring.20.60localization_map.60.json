The main disadvantage of this setup is that we need to transfer all the results involving <code>S</code> to <code>f.codomain</code>. Moreover, it's hard to understand what is going on when you first encounter them. After some experimenting with different ways of bundling the data, it looks like the nicest solution is as follows, as available in the <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/localization_typeclass\"><code>localization_typeclass</code></a> branch.</p>\n<p>Let <code>R S M</code> be as above, and additionally assume <code>[algebra R S]</code>, then we express that <code>S</code> is the localization of <code>R</code> at <code>M</code> with a typeclass <code>is_localization M S</code>, which states that <code>algebra_map R S</code> satisfies the assumptions of <code>localization_map</code>. So far, I have ported <code>ring_theory/localization.lean</code> with positive results: there is a lot less glue code needed between <code>f.codomain</code> and <code>S</code>.</p>",
