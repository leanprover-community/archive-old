I remember last year when Imperial's 1st years were beginning to learn some basic analysis I wanted to get them to formalise a proof that a power series was differentiable within its radius of convergence and that its derivative was what it should be. Do we have this yet? I tend to pick up students more interested in algebra because that's much closer to my own area of speciality, and this year I have an MSc student doing more group cohomology, at Xena today people were looking at formalising abelian categories and so on -- tinkering with MSc level algebra. But we still have this black hole with no Cauchy integral formula etc. I have this vague recollection that people with more of an overview than me were discouraging me from getting people to formalise single-variable calculus because it should all be done in far more generality. But on the other hand we had multivariable polynomial rings for a long time and then Chris did the single variable case anyway and as far as I am concerned this was really useful (in algebraic geometry one often works with multivariable polynomial rings with a finite number of variables, and many proofs are done by induction on number of variables e.g. the proof that <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><msub><mi>X</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><mo>…</mo><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><msub><mi>X</mi><mi>n</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">R[X_1,X_2,\\ldots,X_n]</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.00773em;\">R</span><span class=\"mopen\">[</span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.07847em;\">X</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.30110799999999993em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:-0.07847em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">1</span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.07847em;\">X</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.30110799999999993em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:-0.07847em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">2</span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;\"></span><span class=\"minner\">…</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;\"></span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.07847em;\">X</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.151392em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:-0.07847em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathdefault mtight\">n</span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mclose\">]</span></span></span></span> is Noetherian if <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">R</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.00773em;\">R</span></span></span></span> is).
