Roughly speaking, a matroid on a set is a family of subsets that encodes an abstract version of linear dependence between the elements, and they appear in many different guises in combinatorics and related fields. My work-in-progress is in my <a href=\"https://github.com/bryangingechen/lean-matroids\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bryangingechen/lean-matroids\">lean-matroids</a> repository. In \"lean\" terms, I've defined there 3 complicated <code>structure</code>s which build off of <code>data.finset</code> and proven that they are equivalent to each other.</p>\n<p>This kind of fiddly combinatorial stuff seems to be a bit outside the interests of people here, but nonetheless I would be grateful for any feedback or suggestions on the style of the proofs. And thanks very much to everyone here for the help I've received so far! I'm off to bed now but I'll be back with various questions later on.</p>",

The latest version is currently in the <a href=\"https://github.com/bryangingechen/lean-matroids/tree/fintype2\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bryangingechen/lean-matroids/tree/fintype2\">\"fintype2\" branch</a></p>\n<p>In the first version, I started out using finsets for everything (including the ground set) (now living in <code>matroids-old.lean</code>) and managed to formalize the independent set, circuits, bases and rank function definitions of matroids as well as various equivalences between them. </p>\n<p>After thinking about Mario's comments <a href=\"#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/getting.20a.20nicer.20induction.20hypothesis.20from.20finset.2Einduction/near/134558327\" title=\"#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/getting.20a.20nicer.20induction.20hypothesis.20from.20finset.2Einduction/near/134558327\">here</a> and <a href=\"#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/finset.20of.20subtype.20from.20filter\" title=\"#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/finset.20of.20subtype.20from.20filter\">here</a>, I then switched to using a fintype for the ground set (<code>matroids.lean</code>), which was a fairly painless refactoring up until I had to define restrictions of matroids (right before defining rank functions). That's where I'm stuck now. </p>\n<p>I think I probably need to define \"submatroids\" as a new structure to continue (like how mathlib defines both groups and subgroups separately), since I've hit a wall juggling subtypes and finsets of the ground set. At the same time, I've also been thinking it may make more sense to rework everything in terms of sets instead of finsets.</p>",
