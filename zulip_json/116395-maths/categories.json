I have one of type X ‚ü∂ X in mind but lean is not happy if I give it that here (except using cast or eq.rec and these have already caused a lot of trouble). Kevin and I figured it might be easier to instead compose on either side of this choice these morphisms X ‚ü∂ Y and Y ‚ü∂ X corresponding to those identities.
