Is there a reason why <code>unique_diff_on (s : Π i, E i)</code> and <code>unique_diff_on (s : pi_Lp p hp)</code> should be definitionally equal?<br>\n(It is clear that they should be equivalent because everything is finite-dimensional.  I'm asking because this broke while debugging <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7124\">#7124</a>.  Apparently you could use a proof of <code>unique_diff_on</code> for L^∞ where a proof for L^2 was expected.)</p>",
