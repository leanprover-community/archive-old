The problem is that is seems impossible (to me at least) or in any case very complicated to use results like <code>gcd_domain_eq_field_fractions</code>, where we have a monoid <code>R</code> with field of fractions <code>K</code> and an <code>K</code>-algebra <code>L</code>, in concrete situation, for example when <code>R = ℤ</code>. More precisely, I am not able to prove <code>gcd_domain_eq_field_fractions</code> in the case the GCD monoid is <code>ℤ</code> using <code>gcd_domain_eq_field_fractions</code> (of course redoing the proof in this case is easy).</p>\n<p>I can do the \"unskilled work\", but I need some guidance. For example, Johan suggests that </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">is_localization</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">R</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">comm_ring</span> <span class=\"n\">R</span><span class=\"o\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">comm_ring</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span><span class=\"o\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">algebra</span> <span class=\"n\">R</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span><span class=\"o\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Prop</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>should be a proposition. Should it be a <code>structure</code>? A <code>class</code>?</p>\n<p>If someone wants so shed some light on what is needed to do for this kind of work any advice is very welcome!</p>",
