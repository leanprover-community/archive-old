I think <code>relation</code> is a better name for the file, but I found it useful to introduce a type for binary relations, and I prefer <code>rel</code> for that. (Giving a name to binary relations means we can write <code>r.comp s</code> for example.) I wrote <code>rel</code> in order to be able to carry out the definitions here: <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/order/filter/partial.lean\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/order/filter/partial.lean\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/order/filter/partial.lean</a>.
