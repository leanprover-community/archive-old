When I wanted to define schemes, category theory was not really ready, so I just made sheaves of types on a space, sheaves of types on a basis, sheaves of rings etc all by hand and all differently. It's pretty painless that way, but involves a bunch of repetition. Now of course the general story would be to define sites and then sheaves of X on a site, where X are objects in some category which has enough structure the concept of a sheaf to make sense (e.g. commutative rings, abelian groups...). Now all of a sudden things are going to take a lot longer because Bhavik didn't PR his work because he's a PhD student with a thesis to worry about, and Scott didn't do sheaves in the category theory library yet because he can't figure out a nice API and has 100 other things to worry about, so all of a sudden things start proceeding more slowly. This is the nature of the area. There is no plan. The plan is whatever someone can find the time to do.</p>",
