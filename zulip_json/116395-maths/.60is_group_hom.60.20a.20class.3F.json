The problem is that people often compose group homomorphisms by simply composing them rather than using <code>function.comp</code> or the notation for it. On the other hand, the last time I looked, <code>is_group_hom</code> was indeed a class. Should there be a discussion about whether this is the correct decision?</p>",
