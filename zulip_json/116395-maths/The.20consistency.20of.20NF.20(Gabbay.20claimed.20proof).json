Its distinguishing feature is that it admits a universal set Omega --- thus Omega is an element of Omega.</p>\n<p>The structure of the argument in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.4060\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.4060</a> is as follows: a simple soundness argument, some cut-elimination, saturating a consistent set to a maximal consistent set, and then building an NF model from that maximally consistent set. </p>\n<p>I welcome your input on the feasibility of formalising this.</p>\n<p>I hope the above is completely clear and I welcome questions, comments, and DMs.</p>",
