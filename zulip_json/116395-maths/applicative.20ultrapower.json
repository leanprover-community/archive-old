It seems like we need more than just the <code>applicative</code> laws here. We have internal function types, but can we define 'internal dependent products'?</p>\n<p>If Lean were a  first-order theory like ZFC, you could say \"pick a universe V, and consider the elementary embedding V -&gt; *V\" -- I'm trying to do something analogous to this, but it seems hard as the \"theory of Lean\" is fairly complicated.</p>",
