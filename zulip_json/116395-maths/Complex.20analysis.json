The bit that I got working using this was the \"uniform limits of holomorphic functions are holomorphic\"  roughly following the method you described (i.e. commuting the limit and the integral and then using that C.I. define analytic functions). This is in  <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8979\">#8979</a>, but its a mess and I wouldn't be surprised if there are much more efficient ways of doing this.</p>",

I know how to push assumptions to, e.g,, \"bounded on a closed ball, continuous at the points of its boundary, and differentiable at all but countably many points of the open ball\". This will take several days to formalize and will require a refactor of the Henstock integration code, so I don't want to do it unless I have a reason.</p>\n<p>Is this form of the removable discontinuity theorem mathematically interesting? I don't have enough experience in this area to tell. Wikipedia and google say that people know how to remove larger (e.g., Hausdorff 1-dimensional measure zero) sets of singularities of a bounded function provided that this set of singularities is compact. Does anyone care about removing a dense countable set of singularities?</p>",
