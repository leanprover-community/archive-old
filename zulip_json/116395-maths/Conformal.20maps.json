Does this mean the definition should be something that preserves the quotient of an inner product of two vectors over the product of their norms? Or does this mean I should be defining and using Riemannian metrics to define a conformal map? It seems to me that the mathlib version of Riemannian metrics would be written as a (2, 0)-tensor field, and then say it determines an inner product on every tangent space. I can't think of a more general definition of Riemannian metrics (well, as an average undergraduate student) except the reduction of structure groups of the frame bundle (which we do not have in mathlib (?)) to O(n)  on an n-dimensional smooth manifold.</p>\n<p>The goal of formalizing conformal maps is to utilize the special case of conformal maps on the complex plane, and show that holomorphic functions are conformal. I would be very grateful if someone would give me some related information or suggestion that I can study.</p>",

I'd suggest defining a conformal map between inner product spaces <code>E</code>, <code>F</code> to be a function <code>f : E → F</code>, such that at each <code>x : E</code>, we have <code>has_fderiv_at f f' x</code> for some continuous <code>ℝ</code>-linear map <code>f'</code> which is a multiple of a <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/linear_isometry_equiv\">docs#linear_isometry_equiv</a>.</p>",

What I had in mind is specifically the groupoid of conformal maps from Euclidean space to itself, because this lets you define (using <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/has_groupoid\">docs#has_groupoid</a>) the theory of \"spaces conformally modelled on Euclidean space\", aka \"conformally flat\" manifolds.</p>",
