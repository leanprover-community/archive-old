        "content": "<p>I've been working on a proof of the Mordell-Weil theorem for elliptic curves over number fields, and somewhere in the proof I need the finiteness of an \"S-Selmer group\", defined to be the (multiplicative) subgroup <code>K(S, n) = {x(Kˣ)ⁿ ∈ Kˣ/(Kˣ)ⁿ | ∀ v ∉ S, ord_v(x) ≡ 0 mod n}</code> of the units <code>Kˣ</code> modulo n-th powers <code>(pow_monoid_hom n).range</code> of a number field <code>K</code>. The main idea is that there's an exact sequence linking this group with the S-class group and the S-unit group, and the finiteness of the S-Selmer group is a consequence of the finiteness of these groups.</p>\n<p>I have a fully-working definition (*) of the maps in this exact sequence, as well as sorry-free proofs for their exactness, and its consequent finiteness assuming the finite generation part of Dirichlet's unit theorem, all found in the branch <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/mordell_weil/src/algebraic_geometry/EllipticCurve/selmer.lean\">mordell_weil</a> . The definitions are probably generalisable to a Dedekind domain (so that <code>height_one_spectrum</code> makes sense), and the proofs are generalisable to a Dedekind domain whose class group has finite n-torsion, but for now I just need the number field case. I'm at an early stage of trying to PR this into mathlib, but I'm trying to seek some advice before proceeding.</p>\n<p>The current definition of <code>height_one_spectrum.valuation</code> takes values in <code>with_zero (multiplicative ℤ)</code> (because <code>0</code> is sent to <code>0</code>), but for the purposes of Selmer groups I'm only looking at <code>Kˣ</code> (so <code>multiplicative ℤ</code> is enough), and in fact I need things like <code>Kˣ/(Kˣ)ⁿ →* multiplicative (zmod n)</code> (so having <code>with_zero</code> is actually bad). How should I define a valuation <code>val_of_ne_zero</code> that takes values in <code>multiplicative ℤ</code>? I thought of several options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Currently I'm composing the existing <code>height_one_spectrum.valuation</code> with an isomorphism <code>(with_zero G)ˣ ≃* G</code> I wrote, but this means I have to unfold this isomorphism whenever I want to use the definition, and I thought it's a bit excessive.</li>\n<li>I have a separate file that copies the definition for <code>height_one_spectrum.valuation</code> but without the <code>ite</code>, then a separate lemma to prove they're equal whenever an element is non-zero, so I don't have to copy over all the existing API.</li>\n<li>Perhaps it's worth refactoring all the lemmas for the existing <code>height_one_spectrum.valuation</code> that hold for non-zero elements, including the definition itself?<br>\nAny other suggestions are very welcome.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(*) There is a single sorry at <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/2c19c2982c7553d9f29d155cd1052c89535d3650/src/algebraic_geometry/EllipticCurve/selmer.lean#L92\">line 92</a>, which surfaced when trying to merge newer versions of mathlib. I used the old definition of <code>height_one_spectrum.valuation</code> from the <code>fractional_ideal.lean</code> file in a <a href=\"https://github.com/mariainesdff/ideles/blob/master/src/fractional_ideal.lean\">separate repository</a> by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"406490\">@María Inés de Frutos Fernández</span> that used <code>is_localization.mk'_surjective</code>, but was later defined in mathlib using <code>is_localization.sec</code> and <code>extend_to_localization</code>, so there is a disconnect that isn't immediately resolvable. I wanted to ask for advice on what I should do before trying to fix this.</p>",
