However, because I needed the Cauchy integral formula (more specifically <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/differentiable_on.has_fpower_series_on_ball\">docs#differentiable_on.has_fpower_series_on_ball</a>), I had to assume the algebra had a second countable topology. Of course, in general this won't be true unless the algebra is separable. For instance, the algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space isn't second countable. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"214703\">@Yury G.
