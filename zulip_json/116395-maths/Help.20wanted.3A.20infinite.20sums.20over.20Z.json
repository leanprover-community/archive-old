This has come up in the review process and I'd be grateful for suggestions: </p>\n<p>If <code>f</code> is a function <code>ℤ → α</code> for <code>α</code> a topological abelian group, and <code>f</code> has some (topological) sum <code>a</code>, then how can one show that <code>has_sum (λ n:ℕ, f n + f (-n)) (a + f 0)</code> <em>without assuming any completeness or separation axioms on <code>α</code></em>? There is a proof of this in the library assuming that <code>α</code> is complete and Hausdorff (<code>has_sum.sum_nat_of_sum_int</code>), which I want to use in my new PR. The reviewer points out that these hypotheses should be removable, which seems plausible to me, but I don't see a simple way of proving it.</p>",
