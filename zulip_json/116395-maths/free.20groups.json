        "content": "<p>When formalizing free groups, one has the choice of taking all words and then form a quotient (this is done in mathlib), or define the type of normalized words and build the group on top of that (likely with a normalizion function, and multiplication being concatenation followed by normalization).</p>\n<p>In a previous life I once formalized them in Isabelle and later in Agda, and made these notes</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At first I wanted to follow the same path again and tried to define the free group on the set of fully reduced words. This is the natural way in Isabelle, where the existing setup for groups expects you to define the carrier as a subset of an existing type (the type here being lists of generators and their inverses). But I did not get far, and also I had to start using stuff like DecidableEquivalence, an indication that this might not go well with the intuitionalistic logic. So I changed my approach and defined the free group on all words as elements of the group, with a suitable equivalence relation. This allowed me define the free group construction and show its group properties without any smell of classical logic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But mathlib isn't shy of classical logic, isn't it? So out of curiosity I wonder why mathlib's definition for free groups is using quotients. Because the support for quotient types is so good, it's worth using it? Or because it is simply simpler?</p>\n<p>(One reason I'm asking is because we don't have the free product of groups yet, do we, and they'd probably be constructed similarly.)</p>",
