If you imagine a first countable complete uniform space, except for a point <code>x</code> that can not be reached by countable sequences, and you remove this point, then the new space will still be first countable, all Cauchy sequences will converge, and still it will not be complete. The good condition would rather be that the uniformity is countably generated, but we have no type class for this, and I do not see real life examples where it would be useful to have this generalization.</p>\n<p>For the completeness of <code>L^p</code>, let me insist that this is really something which is proved by sequences (contrary to many statements in metric spaces that could be proved more easily with filters, I completely agree with you about that). With more details, the proof goes as follows. Take a Cauchy sequences <code>u n</code>. Extract a subsequence <code>v n</code> such that the distance from <code>v n</code>to <code>v(n+1)</code> is at most <code>2^{-n}</code>. Form the series <code>V = \\sum \\abs(v_{n+1} - v_n)</code>. Check that it has finite integral. In particular, it is almost everywhere finite. Then the series <code>v = \\sum (v_{n+1} - v_n)</code> is also defined almost everywhere. Moreover, by dominated convergence (using the dominating function <code>V</code>), <code>v n</code> tends to <code>v</code> in <code>L^p</code>. Finally, our original Cauchy sequence <code>u n</code> has a converging subsequence, hence it converges.</p>",
