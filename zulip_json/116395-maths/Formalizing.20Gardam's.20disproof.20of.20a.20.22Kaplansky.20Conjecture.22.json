This is a very basic statement in Algebra, saying that the only units in the group ring over a field of a _torsion-free_ group are the _trivial_ ones - those of the form $a\\cdot g$. Besides the simple and basic statement, what makes the question interesting is that it is one of a bunch of statements saying something is trivial for torsion-free groups (zero divisors, Whitehead groups, ...).</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"303675\">@Anand Rao</span> and I have formalized this proof in <code>lean 4</code> at <a href=\"https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/Polylean/tree/main/Polylean\">https://github.com/siddhartha-gadgil/Polylean/tree/main/Polylean</a>. The README in that folder gives an outline of the code. Our proof mixes proving with some computation, and part of our motivation was to use the nature of <code>lean 4</code> as a theorem prover as well as a programming language with both aspects integrated.</p>\n<p>More details will follow soon in a blog post or two. Comments and suggestions are very welcome.</p>",
