Specifically, we relate the norm squared of the elements of eigenvectors to the eigenvalues and the submatrix eigenvalues.<br>\nArticle: <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/neutrinos-lead-to-unexpected-discovery-in-basic-math-20191113/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/neutrinos-lead-to-unexpected-discovery-in-basic-math-20191113/\">Neutrinos Lead to Unexpected Discovery in Basic Math, Quanta magazine</a></p>",
