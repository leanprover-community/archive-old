I think Patrick went through the same thought process recently and now he's written a bunch of code for the perfectoid project about completions, and a desire to understand that has turned into a wider desire to understand some of these basic mathematical objects like filters and lattices which they don't actually seem to teach mathematicians.</p>",

But I think the titles are a bit unfair to Bourbaki, and especially to André Weil. Actually this is a story I keep telling people when I try to explain proof assistants. Boubaki invented filters because they were facing the exact same issue that proof assistants are facing. They wanted to prove everything without repeating statements and proofs again and again. It really makes sense that we are using the solution those very clever guys invented for that purpose.</p>",
