The general reference for <code>topology/algebra/filter_basis</code> is \"General Topology\" by Bourbaki, but I haven't been able to find mention of group filter bases in there - I've also looked for the same structure under a different name, but obviously it's difficult to do that without reading the whole book. Was Massot the first person to write down explicitly the axioms of a group filter basis, or are they somewhere in Bourbaki/elsewhere?</p>",
