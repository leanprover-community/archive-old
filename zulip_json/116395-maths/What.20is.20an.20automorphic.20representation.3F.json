I did not know this theory and ever since then I've been telling people that I have written papers about automorphic representations and I don't even know what they are.</p>\n<p>I visited Durham a few weeks ago and was explaining all this to my my eldest mathematical grandson, Jack Shotton, and he pointed out that an automophic representation was just a subquotient and you didn't have to worry about all the direct integral stuff.</p>\n<p>I have finally got around to googling, and he's right. Furthermore I've found a really good source for the definition in full generality, and it's <a href=\"https://services.math.duke.edu/~jgetz/aut_reps.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://services.math.duke.edu/~jgetz/aut_reps.pdf\">this</a>. I think it does a really good job of explaining the definition right down to the mathematical nuts and bolts. I think it would be a really interesting formalisation project.</p>\n<p>A couple of things which the computer scientists might find amusing: check out the definition of an automorphic representation (definition 3.10) on p19. It's a representation of something called <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"script\">H</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathcal{H}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathcal\" style=\"margin-right:0.00965em;\">H</span></span></span></span></span>. Now check out section 5.5 -- \"an alternate definition\"! It's now a module for a completely different thing. The two types have a canonical <code>equiv</code> which we all believe, so people refer to both types as automorphic representations. Some proof techniques are more amenable to one \"representation\" than the other. </p>\n<p>The proof that the arrows of the <code>equiv</code> are inverse to each other is \"a result due to Harish-Chandra\",  for which we are given no reference, or even an idea of how deep the result is. Let me note that this is not a criticism of the notes! I have no doubt that this is a standard theorem and any expert could tell you a proof and a reference. It's just funny that it's not there and you can't do that in computer science.</p>",

There can be two equiv types <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>, and maybe the map <code>f : X -&gt; Y</code> is easy to define, but defining the (noncomputable) inverse is equivalent to proving the deep theorem that <code>f</code> is a bijection. Now say you want to define a function on <code>Y -&gt; Y</code>and you want to pull back a function on <code>X -&gt; X</code>, but we can't build the map <code>(Y -&gt; Y) -&gt; (X -&gt; X)</code> without proving the theorem needed to define the <code>equiv</code>. In particular, we can't say \"a perfectoid space is a Y such that all Y -&gt; Y have property P defined on X's\" without proving a theorem.</p>",
