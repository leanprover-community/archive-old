During his time in Edinburgh he typed up the first half of group.lean into ForTheL and then pretty-printed it into a pdf file.</p>\n<p>I know Tom Hales is interested in getting a controlled natural language to work with Lean as part of the Fabstracts project, because he (rightly, in my opinion) believes that more mathematicians will be attracted to his project if it looked like the attached pdf rather than the lean file (we lean-readers forget how intimidating Lean looks to regular mathematicians). This document is some evidence that the idea of getting human-readable text from Lean is perhaps not as far-fetched as one might initially guess.</p>\n<p>I finish with a quote from Koepke answering my question about sharing the document.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Can I share it on the Lean chat? [I haven't done this yet]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes please, provided you could warn readers that this is just a dummy;<br>\nactually it would not even run in the Naproche-SAD version which is on<br>\nGithub, since I used a slightly modified fork on my laptop.</p>\n</blockquote>",
