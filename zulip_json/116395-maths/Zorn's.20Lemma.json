        "content": "<p>This is something I've been reading/thinking about recently. There are two well-known ways to construct inductive types in set theory, neither of which requires inaccessible cardinals.</p>\n<p>The first is by a transfinite construction (along the lines of the small object argument): Imagine the ordinals index time. Roughly, at each ordinal, add all the terms you don't already have that you can form by applying a constructor to arguments which were added at previous stages. If every constructor has finite arity, you can stop at time omega. If there are constructors of infinite arity, you need to find an ordinal alpha for which any set of ordinals less than alpha indexed by the arity of a constructor has an upper bound which is again at least alpha (basically, a sufficiently large regular cardinal). In ZFC, this is easy: take alpha to be the successor of the sup of the arities of all constructors. In ZF only, this may not work (e.g. a countable union of countable sets may be uncountable) and it is in fact consistent (at least relative to some other mild consistency hypothesis) that no such alpha exists.</p>\n<p>The second way is to represent a term of an inductive type as a certain kind of well-founded \"tree\" (this is where W in W-type comes from, I believe). Each constructor appearing anywhere in such a term has a location specified as a finite list of indices into the arities of the constructors which appear above it in the tree. The term can be recovered from the data of the constructor at every location, so you can define the inductive type to consist of a particular subtype of <code>list I -&gt; J</code> where <code>I</code> is the sum of the arities of all constructors, and <code>J</code> indexes the constructors. This construction works in ZF, and even in any topos with a natural number object.</p>\n<p>However, the first construction generalizes to free algebras for algebraic theories which can contain equations, and the existence of such is actually equivalent in ZF to the existence of a proper class of regular cardinals. The Bonk and Schramm proof probably needs something like this, because you need to identify equivalent Cauchy sequences to end up with a metric space (and not a pseudometric space or whatever). Anyways this is all significantly weaker than choice, which for all I know the Bonk-Schramm proof probably uses anyways.</p>\n<p>To summarize, to roughly indicate the logical status of inductive constructions, the order of logical strength is something like</p>\n<p>elementary topos (roughly, Lean without <code>Type</code>, recursive inductive types like the naturals, or axioms?)<br>\nnatural number object &lt;=&gt; all inductive types<br>\nZF<br>\nZF + proper class of regular cardinals &lt;=&gt; ZF + free algebras for algebraic theories with equations<br>\nZF + (certain weak forms of choice...)<br>\nZFC<br>\nZFC + there exist countably many inaccessible cardinals (roughly, Lean with everything)<br>\nZFC+U (every set is contained in an inaccessible cardinal), etc.</p>",
