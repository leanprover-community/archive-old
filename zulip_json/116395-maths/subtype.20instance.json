The proofs were of course extremely similar to the case of monoids and groups. So I exploited^Wencouraged Simon to write a new tactic built on top of <code>refine_struct</code> in the spirit of <code>pi_instance</code>. The result is  <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/267\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/267\">#267</a>. Of course any comment is welcome, but I'd be particularly interested in trying to answer question about how <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/267/files#diff-040c2692bc712ca8fface6e4aa45ce62R31\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/267/files#diff-040c2692bc712ca8fface6e4aa45ce62R31\">this tactic</a> works, since I managed to fool myself into believing I mostly understand it and should write a tutorial about it.</p>",
