It might well be in mathlib within a year.  You saw that the corresponding theorem for compact operators is in the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05360\">preprint</a> from Frédéric, Rob and me?  (for self-adjoint rather than normal operators, but the barrier was now-mostly-unlocked results in complex analysis.)</p>",

I would argue that one of the big obstacles to getting this result is the common mathlib problem of doing things in the right generality. </p>\n<p>That is, if you're going to prove this result, then you want to do it for normal operators in von Neumann algebras (this is essentially the Borel functional calculus after all), but we haven't even yet defined von Neumann algebras, and we will have to make some highly nontrivial decisions to do so. For example, do we carry around a Hilbert space on which the von Neumann algebra acts, or do we instead carry around its pre-dual? It's not at all obvious to me right now which is preferable. </p>\n<p>Of course, we could go directly for 9.18, in which case I'm pretty sure we could get it in mathlib this year, but I don't know why we would do that. While the Borel functional calculus might be a ways off, we are not too far off from the continuous functional calculus for normal operators in C*-algebras.</p>",
