My impression is that the community are not keen on adding the structure of maps f:A -&gt; G such that f(a+b)=f(a)*f(b), because then we have to make an API for it, and how it composes with additive maps on one side and multiplicative maps on the other side, and then there are maps G -&gt; A and etc etc. Another proposal is to define add_char so that it contains an application of of_add : R -&gt; multiplicative R and then just write add_char.map_add : \\psi (a + b) = \\psi a * \\psi b and a bit more API for it.</p>\n<p>My position on this has come from a huge struggle I had in the past using with_top because it would often leak to option, and if you were working with with_top and with_bot then you didn't know whether none was bot or top. Being principled with types in statements of results goes a long way towards stopping this kind of leakage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To add to Kevin 's comment above, I find it quite painful to have to use <code>multiplicative R →* R'</code> instead of something like, say, <code>R +→* R'</code> and having to convert between <code>R</code> and <code>multiplicative R</code> via <code>of_add</code> and <code>to_add</code>. (And as one can see from Kevin's comments on the PR, I didn't manage to do it completely right...). If homomorphisms between additive and multiplicative structures also occur in some other places, it may be worth the effort of having dedicated type classes and API for them. Maybe there is a way of auto-generate them, something like a \"left\" or \"right\" version of to_additive?</p>",
