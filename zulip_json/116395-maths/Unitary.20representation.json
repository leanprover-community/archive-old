Should it be just a property on general representations? Or should it be defined analogously to general representations as a morphism of $G$ into isometries of a normed vector space? I would probably implement it in the first way but I might not be seeing some problems that might appear later</p>",

That theory is developed quite generally, so you'll have to specialise it to Hilbert spaces, for which maybe this file is relevant: analysis.inner_product_space.adjoint</p>",
