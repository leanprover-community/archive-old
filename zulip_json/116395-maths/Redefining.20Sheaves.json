Some mathematicians claim that categories/functors are all over the place and that it is the right (and only right) way to proceed, but most of them do it appropriately lazily enough (forgetting about forgetful functors all over the place, for example). For a large scale formalization process, thinking categorically has advantages since it makes a lot of the constructions systematic. I guess it would be fruitful to gather pros and cons, and regarding cons, it would probably be fruitful to think about how to circumvent them systematically. Maybe, for particular categories, one would realize that they were not properly defined (such as filters, as Johann, Kevin and Patrick did) and this would lead to a (essentially equivalent but slightly) better definition, at least to a better understanding.</p>",

I tried also putting the morphisms in a separate structure (already on the level of <code>induced_category</code>) as is currently done for sheaves, but I ran into two issues:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Apparently some uses of the <code>bundled</code> framework can lead to some concrete categories being created through multiple levels of <code>induced_category</code>, which means you have to write things like <code>f.val.val</code> to get hold of the actual map.</li>\n<li>If <code>x</code> is a point of a topological space <code>X</code>, then the preorder category <code>open_nhds x</code> is a full_subcategory of the preorder category <code>opens X</code>. If we create a structure for the morphisms in a full subcategory, then <code>open_nhds x</code> has two non-defeq category structures, which causes issues.</li>\n</ol>",
