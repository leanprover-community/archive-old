This means that the good setting for the tangent space is a topological vector space, of which normed space will be a special case.</p>\n<p>This is not hard to introduce, but as some of you have played a lot with topological rings in the perfectoid project I don't want to duplicate what has already been done. Are there already topological modules over a topological ring, either in mathlib or in the wild?</p>",
