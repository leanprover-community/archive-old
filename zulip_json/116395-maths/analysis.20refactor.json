And one keeps computing with such objects, adding, subtracting or comparing them. All these computations are really much more convenient in reals than nnreals, although I guess they could most of the time be done in nnreals, at the price of making the proofs much more painful (for instance, in the definition of the Gromov product, the triangular inequality shows that <code>d(x, y) ≤ d(e,x) + d(e,y)</code>, so that the definition in reals or nnreals gives the same result, at least if one parenthesises the expression correctly). <br>\nIn fact, at the beginning I defined the Gromov product to be in <code>nnreal</code>, but later on I had to refactor everything as it made things uselessly complicated.</p>\n<p>For the general issue, making distances and norms take values in <code>nnreal</code> would mathematically be the right thing to do. But I am not convinced that the benefits outweigh the difficulties in applications. As a middle ground, one could have two functions <code>nndist</code> and <code>dist</code>. Another related question is to have distances even taking values in <code>ennreal</code>. I think this is important to have, for instance to define the graph distance on a non-connected graph, or the <code>L^2</code> norm of a function which is not square-integrable (these are two real-life problems that I met in Isabelle and where I was stuck with the current hierarchy). Maybe a class <code>emetric_space</code> with distances taking values in <code>ennreal</code> (this is enough to define for instance a uniform structure, a topology, and so on), and a subclass <code>metric_space</code> in which the distance only takes finite values?</p>",
