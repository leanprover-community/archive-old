Currently it's only purpose is the proof of <code>extend_Z_bilin</code> which is the crucial ingredient to extend the multiplication of a topological ring to its Hausdorff completion. Note that the separation in <code>extend_Z_bilin</code> and <code>extend_Z_bilin_key</code> is mostly because the proof was too long to elaborate for Lean to be used interactively (at least on my computer). But also, the key part is actually where stuff happens while the rest is massaging information which is already there. I'd be curious to see whether you can simplify this (I don't mean turn everything into term mode, I mean actual Lean or maths simplification). This closely follows Bourbaki (I can send you the pdf in English if needed) except that the massaging is completely implicit in Bourbaki.</p>",

This construction is almost the construction in Bourbaki except that, again, their construction of the Hausdorff completion of anything is slightly different: first they quotient by the separation relation, and they take the space of minimal Cauchy filters. When doing ring completions, they first make a separated ring as I explained, and then go to the space of minimal Cauchy filters. In our setup, we only need to construct a (functorial) isomorphism between <code>completion (quotient separation_setoid a)</code> and <code>completion a</code>. If I remember correctly, I did that carefully on paper but not yet in Lean. Then we'll be ready to chain our two constructions (going from separated assumption to the completion, relying on <code>extend_Z_bilin</code> and going from no assumption to separated using <code>group_separation_rel</code>)</p>",

Remember we know (from <code>group_separation_rel</code>) we want to quotient by the closure of zero. This closure is a two-sided ideal. Indeed left multiplication by any element is continuous so the image of closure of zero is contained in the closure of the image of zero, which is zero. Same works with right multiplication of course. Now assume <code>x</code> and <code>x'</code> are equivalent, and <code>y</code> and <code>y'</code> are equivalent. Hence <code>x-x'</code> and <code>y-y'</code> are in our ideal. Write <code>xy = (x-x')*y + x'*(y-y')+x'y'</code>. The first two terms in RHS are in our ideal, so <code>x'*y'</code> is equivalent to <code>x*y</code>. I'm too tired for Lean tonight, but I'll do that if you don't do it first.</p>",
