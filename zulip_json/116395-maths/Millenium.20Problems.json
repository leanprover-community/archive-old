Is the conjecture \"the group is finitely-generated, the L-function has analytic continuation, and the order of vanishing at 1 is equal to the rank of the group\"?

I have got someone in London thinking about modular forms (Chris Birkbeck), and I think Heather and Alex Kontorovich are thinking about them too. I will have a project student thinking about elliptic curves in June. The problem with \"random people doing it\" is that often their work doesn't end up in mathlib; indeed our initial schemes work did not end up in mathlib, and it took several years before a 3rd generation definition made it into the library. We're having a lot of fun, but progress is slow simply because we don't have enough people and not enough of those that we have are trained to write code which is professional enough to make it into mathlib.</p>",

I think the idea of formalising the statement of strong BSD is a great one.</p>\n<p>In my not so humble opinion, here is what I think is one of the underlying problems with this entire computer theorem proving area. Until recently it was mostly dominated by computer scientists, most of whom neither know nor care about the strong BSD conjecture. The kind of mathematics which was being formalised was completely random as a consequence of this; people would try something, and if it turned out to look difficult they'd give up and try something else which they could manage because they needed their next paper. So you look through the literature and see totally random useless stuff formalised, and easy stuff being formalised several times, and so on. You want to formalise the work of a Fields Medallist? Let's choose John Thompson because Feit and him proved a theorem about finite groups whose proof just used a whole bunch of other theorems about finite groups, and finite groups are easy to define in a theorem prover. With this attitude the area was growing in a really unappealing and uninteresting way. Occasionally some good stuff would get done, e.g. odd order or PNT or Kepler, but for the most part these were proofs involving elementary objects, and to a certain extent this reflected the mathematical interests or abilities of those doing the formalising. Lean aims to change all that, by working on things which are much too hard to do in Lean or any other prover like strong BSD, and then distilling out from that various things which <em>can</em> be done and, because they're related to strong BSD, a \"trendy\" thing, are of inherent interest to young mathematicians watching this area and trying to figure out what is going on. But you don't get something for nothing -- formalising strong BSD will be hard work. But the para above explains why I really think it's worth it.</p>",
