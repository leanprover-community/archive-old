        "content": "<p>In type theory, \"there exists a unique function with some property\" is a strictly less useful claim than \"here is something which produces the function with this property\". The suggestion is that instead of proving there exists a unique f, you produce a function which actually spits out f. In type theory you have to do this with the axiom of choice (even if you've proved uniqueness), but this doesn't matter. Instead of having to extract the function from the proof that it exists and is unique, Johan is suggesting that you make the construction and then prove things about the construction.</p>",
