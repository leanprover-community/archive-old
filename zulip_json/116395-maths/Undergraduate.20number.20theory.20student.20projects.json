In 2018 the question from the UGs was \"do we have undergraduate thing X\" and my answer was almost always \"no, but we want that in mathlib so why don't you go away and make it\" and the answer to \"I'm looking for a project to help me learn Lean at a higher level\" was \"great, can you make bundled subsemirings, just copy submonoids\" and people could be really helpful towards driving this community project forwards. </p>\n<p>Lately, mathlib-helping projects suitable for first year undergraduates have become much harder for me to construct. One of the reasons for this is that in the lean code I'm writing as part of my research, the issues I'm running into involve technical things like normal closures or complex calculations in an abelian category, and it's all a bit much for first years.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, looking at what people like <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"481963\">@David Loeffler</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"479359\">@Michael Stoll</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"389019\">@Chris Birkbeck</span> are doing -- you're all engaging with mathematics that I learnt in Cambridge Part III and my experience with working at this level is that projects suitable for first year undergraduates do show up sometimes</p>",
