The person then asked why we can't just say that <code>a = b</code> is false rather than \"meaningless\" when <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> have different types, and I realized that I didn't really have any good answer. In fact, this is basically exactly what <code>heq</code> is doing (the contrapositive of <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/type_eq_of_heq\">docs#type_eq_of_heq</a> says exactly that if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> have different types, then it is false that <code>a == b</code>).<br>\nHence my (perhaps naive) question is, why is <code>eq</code> the fundamental thing that we use everywhere and not <code>heq</code>? What can we do with <code>eq</code> that we can't do with <code>heq</code> that justifies this?</p>",

inference in Lean. They can be marked as \"type class instances\" and solved automatically using facts from the local context. The theorems involving <code>rec</code> correspond to computation in Lean. They can be marked as simplification theorems and \"unfolded\" when necessary.</p>\n<p>One of the advantages of this is that most of the times you don't need to bother about \"types\". The inference does the job and everything aligns perfectly. However, if you want to express some more complex things (which would require <code>heq</code> in Lean), you can do that without any problem. The only artifact would be additional goal to prove that <code>l ∈ List α</code> for some <code>l</code> and <code>α</code> if it can't be proved automatically. In contrast, Lean would yell at you due to type mismatch or motive not being type correct.</p>",
