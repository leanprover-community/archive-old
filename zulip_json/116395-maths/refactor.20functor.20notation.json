The big arrow seems to be used in multiple contexts, so perhaps we shouldn't have any global notation for it at all, and use local notations instead. The broken right arrow has the advantage that it is an unusual arrow, so I'm more okay with stealing it as a global notation (making it unusable for other purposes).</p>",
