Indeed, such hyperplanes exist over the algebraic closure of the ground field, since our curve is smooth and hence geometrically reduced.  Moreover, the set of such hyperplanes is a dense open subset of the set of all hyperplanes.  If our field is infinite, then there are hyperplanes in the intersection.  Otherwise, we use a form of Bertini's theorem, exploiting the \"ampleness\" of the embedding.</p>\n<p>Next, use the linear system formed by one hyperplane <code>H</code> transverse to <code>C</code> and any other hyperplane <code>H' ≠ p</code>.  This linear system extends to a morphism to <code>ℙ^1</code> that is separable, since the fiber corresponding to <code>H</code> is geometrically reduced.</p>\n<p>The challenge is to formalize a proof of this!  <span aria-label=\"wink\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f609\" role=\"img\" title=\"wink\">:wink:</span></p>\n<p>Here is also an example of what fails otherwise.</p>\n<p>Let <code>k</code> be an imperfect field of characteristic <code>p</code> and let <code>k ⊂ k' be a non-separable, purely inseparable extension (i.e. I am excluding the trivial purely inseparable extension!).

Let's say we put topology X on a perfectoid space. Then what about the papers which claim that the definition is the topology generated by Y?

If we define an elliptic curve over a field to be a smooth proper geometrically connected variety of dimension 1 with a commutative group structure (which is a definition you'll see in the fancier books) then it will be a lot easier to prove weak Mordell-Weil because we won't have to prove anything about a group law on those pesky plane cubics! Why not just remark that there are several definitions of a global field and they're all known to be mathematically equivalent but you haven't formalised the equivalences, but the issue is only in the char p setting so won't affect your future work?</p>",
