I asked someone in our department and they immediately expressed the wonderful viewpoint that in their opinion they didn't think that fields should be PIDs! I can completely see their point! It's developing a theory of geometric objects of dimension &lt;= 1 and then continuously having to say \"...and not 0\" the moment one gets going. Note that the definition of DVR (the local analogy of a Dedekind domain) does seem to exclude fields by convention. The question is analogous to whether 1 should be a prime -- it's an annoyance at the beginning having to exclude it but then you find that the meatier theorems don't work with it. It's also like whether the definition of filter should be bourbaki's or ours. Perhaps there's no good answer. Part of me wants to vote for fields being pre-Dedekind-domains but not Dedekind domains. However because \"I'm not a field\" is so easy to say in mathlib perhaps we just leave things as they are. </p>\n<p>Note that I don't buy \"the literature says this\" as a defence though -- the literature is pretty adamant that our definition of filter is incorrect and that didn't stop us.</p>",
