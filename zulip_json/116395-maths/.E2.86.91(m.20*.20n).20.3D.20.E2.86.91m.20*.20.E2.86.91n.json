        "content": "<p>I remember struggling a lot with coercions when I was a beginner last year, and now I see my students struggling with them. Coming back to them now and thinking about them now I have more experience has really helped, because I understand far better what is going on and can answer many of my own questions now. </p>\n<p>Given that Lean holds the principle of good naming conventions in high regard, it's initially a bit surprising to see three (at least) conventions for the name of <code>↑(m * n) = ↑m * ↑n</code>, which is the statement of all three lemmas below:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"bp\">#</span><span class=\"kn\">check</span> <span class=\"bp\">@</span><span class=\"n\">int</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">coe_nat_mul</span> <span class=\"c1\">-- coercion from nat to int</span>\n<span class=\"bp\">#</span><span class=\"kn\">check</span> <span class=\"bp\">@</span><span class=\"n\">nat</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">cast_mul</span> <span class=\"c1\">-- coercion from nat to a general semiring</span>\n<span class=\"bp\">#</span><span class=\"kn\">check</span> <span class=\"bp\">@</span><span class=\"n\">pnat</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">mul_coe</span> <span class=\"c1\">-- coercion from pnat to nat</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>There are lots of confusing things going on here. The theorem from nat to int is called <code>int.something</code> (so it's a theorem about the target), the theorem from nat to real is called <code>nat.something</code> (so it's a theorem about the source), the up-arrow seems to being referred to as both a <code>cast</code> and a <code>coe</code> in naming conventions, with <code>coe</code> being used once when the namespace is the source and once when it's the target, and so on.</p>\n<p>My vague impression is that this is happening because there are several competing things which people want, and we can't have them all at once. But Gabriel's comment from a few days ago has <em>greatly</em> clarified how one can work with these things without going insane searching for lemmas whose names one can't guess; if you want to find out what the theorem saying <code>↑(m * n) = ↑m * ↑n</code> from, say, rat to real, is called, then just write</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">data</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">real</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">basic</span>\n\n<span class=\"kn\">set_option</span> <span class=\"n\">trace</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">simplify</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">rewrite</span> <span class=\"n\">true</span>\n\n<span class=\"kn\">example</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ℚ</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"o\">(((</span><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"bp\">*</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ℚ</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ℝ</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ℝ</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"bp\">*</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">y</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ℝ</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"k\">by</span> <span class=\"n\">simp</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>because <em>when written in this form, <code>simp</code> will do it</em>. And now if you want to know the name of the theorem it used (perhaps because you want to use a rewrite instead, for some reason), just click on <code>simp</code> and see. </p>\n<p>I don't really understand why we have all these naming conventions, but at the end of the day this workaround to discover the names has worked several times for me.</p>",
