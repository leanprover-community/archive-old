I would like to formalise some easy undergraduate maths just to get back in to it. Any recommendations? I was thinking of doing just some basic groups, ring theory or linear algebra. Last time I looked at Lean they didn't have a formalisation of the reals. Is that still the case? If the reals have been formalised then perhaps doing some simple real analysis. What active existing libraries should I look at for this kind of thing? I am aware of Xena and the official lean library repo.</p>",

I am not even sure that there is a theory of infinite sums in mathlib, although the definition of a convergent infinite sum (that the finite sums converge) could easily be put into mathlib; the thing is that the moment you put this in, you have to prove a whole bunch of lemmas.
