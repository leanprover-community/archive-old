        "content": "<p>I think this works.</p>\n<p>Use <code>free_semiring bool</code> and say <code>ff &lt; tt</code> and the free monoid <code>M</code> generated by <code>tt</code> and <code>ff</code> can be linearly ordered lexicographically (I think this is the ordinal 2^omega, short words are always smaller than big words, so not quite the dictionary order). If  an indexing set <code>M</code> is linearly ordered, then <code>M -&gt;_0 nat</code> is linearly ordered lexicographically, so you can linearly order the <code>free_semiring</code> (you compare the coefficient of the biggest element of M for which the coefficients differ). I think this satisfies all the axioms, but some of the multiplication ones would be messy to verify. The multiplication axioms for ordered rings seem much simpler than for linear ordered semirings, I'd be quite confident about satisfying those with <code>free_ring bool</code></p>",
