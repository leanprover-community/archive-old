        "content": "<p>Hey everyone! I'm thinking a bit about the possibility of adding a proof that the category of categories is both complete and co-complete. The proof I know is by caracterizing categories as monadic over quivers, and then using the fact that quivers are complete and co-complete as they are a presheaf-like categories. The monadicity theorem and the the adjunction between quivers and categories are already formalised so I think that the first part seems manageable at least in theory.<br>\nThe second part seems to have a subtlety: the way quivers are defined in lean do not allow for a direct and easy presheaf-like description because of the two universes parameters: quivers with vertices of size <code>u</code> and with hom-types of size <code>v</code>should form some full subcategory of functors from the walking parralel pair to <code>Type max (u v)</code>, but the exact essential image don't seem to be that easy to work with at first glance (the image of the object correpresenting vertices should be a <code>u</code>-small type, but the image of the object co-representing edges should be some sigma type which may not have an easy recognition principle), and I'm starting to wonder wether this approach to proving that categories have limits and colimits is really the right one. Have anyone here thought a bit about this stuff?</p>",
