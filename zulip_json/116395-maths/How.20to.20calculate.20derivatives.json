My idea would be to first show <code>has_deriv_at (λ x, f x * g x / c) (..) x0</code>, where (..) is the expression coming from using <code>has_deriv_at.div_const</code> and <code>has_deriv_at.mul</code> and then use uniqueness of the derivative to convert the rest to (annoying) algebraic calculations. This sounds extremely tedious and not elegant to me, so is there a better way?</p>",
