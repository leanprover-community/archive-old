I was writing a lecture about the real numbers and got distracted by the question on why we insist on telling the students that the reals are the unique complete ordered field, and <em>that</em> was what they were working with all along, whereas I think that many of them come to university with the following definition:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"c\">/-</span><span class=\"cm\">- The non-negative real numbers in the mind of a schoolkid -/</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">structure</span> <span class=\"n\">mynnreal</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">-- An auxiliary non-negative real number $x$ has an</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">-- &quot;integer part&quot;, its `floor`...</span>\n<span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">floor</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"bp\">ℕ</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">-- ...and the decimal part, an infinite string of digits</span>\n<span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">frac</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"bp\">ℕ</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">fin</span> <span class=\"mi\">10</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\">-- assuming base 10, so digits={0,1,...,9}</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">-- except that you&#39;re not allowed to end in infinitely many nines</span>\n<span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">no_nines</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"bp\">∀</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">B</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"bp\">ℕ</span><span class=\"o\">),</span> <span class=\"bp\">∃</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">N</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"bp\">ℕ</span><span class=\"o\">),</span> <span class=\"n\">B</span> <span class=\"bp\">≤</span> <span class=\"n\">N</span> <span class=\"bp\">∧</span> <span class=\"n\">frac</span> <span class=\"n\">N</span> <span class=\"bp\">≠</span> <span class=\"mi\">9</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>I thought it might be an interesting exercise to prove that this structure was equiv to <code>nnreal</code> -- I think it might make a nice student project to be honest -- but my instinct was to write down the maps first and then we can think about this <code>equiv</code> later. But the map from decimals to reals is a simple infinite sum (let me stress that I am not going to build a Cauchy sequence of rationals -- for me that is not a \"valid\" part of the API for reals). I looked at how <code>exp</code> was done (and I remember at the time being completely <em>thrilled</em> by the appearance of <code>exp</code>, it began to convince me that analysis could be done), but now I look at what we have and think that it could look nicer. There's a lot of <code>(λ n, ∑ m in range n, abs (z ^ m / nat.fact m))</code> -- what is the constructor that doesn't mention <code>n</code>?</p>\n<p>Going the other way we need some theorem about real numbers being the sum of their digits. I remember <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"132603\">@Calle Sönne</span> being interested in this and then I kind of derailed the project by asking him whether he could prove something about convergence in some general class of floor rings and we went down a rabbithole. Now I would have a more pragmatic view -- the things to be proving theorems about are the version of \"complete ordered field\" which implies uniquely isomorphic to R. Calle and I even had two branches of mathlib concerning this stuff: see <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/digits\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/kmb-digits\">here</a>; I'm sure Rob would love it to have two old branches merged or deleted and replaced with a coherent exposition of decimal expansions.</p>",

At the time I scoffed at this, saying \"the reals are not decimals, this is ridiculous\", but now I realise that this result is all part of one bigger picture and the equiv is in some sense the result you want in mathlib (and presumably at some point one could also tackle the issues about why \"column addition with carry\", \"column subtraction with borrow\", \"long multiplication\", \"bus stop method division\" etc all work.</p>",
