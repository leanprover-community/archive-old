You can now go (when solving, i.e., backwards) either from <code>uniform_space</code> to <code>emetric_space</code> to <code>metric_space</code> or from <code>uniform_space</code> directly to <code>metric_space</code>.</li>\n<li>I don't understand what the parameter <code>instance_max_depth</code> actually controls. It isn't the nesting level as shown in parentheses, which never goes above 10 in the successful trace with emetric spaces. Maybe it has something to do with the number of unassigned metavariables?</li>\n<li>Perhaps more concerning than hitting the depth limit is how long it takes to find the instance with the limit increased. The successful log is about 600MB. The instance search seems to have no memory, so alternative paths to the same point, like from <code>uniform_space</code> to <code>metric_space</code>, even if not causing a diamond problem, are still dangerous for performance: the work done to find an instance can grow exponentially in the number of such branches.</li>\n</ul>",
