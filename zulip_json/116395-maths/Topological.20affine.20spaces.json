My main motivation is to be able to prove, e.g., continuity of <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/affine_map.line_map\">docs#affine_map.line_map</a> simultaneously for topological additive groups and for normed add torsors. I get some strange elaboration issues down the road. Usually, they can be solved by using <code>convert</code> but I fail to understand why they happen.</p>",
