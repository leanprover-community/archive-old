Of course, we <em>can</em> define quasi-categories, but we then need to take the ∞-groupoid quotient by the Joyal equivalences, and we don't know how to do that. These problems all seem to require each other for their solution in HoTT, and noone knows where to start.<br>\nNote that this problem with analytically defining (∞,1)-categories etc. in HoTT occurs because we aim to represent higher mathematical objects by their correct type/∞-groupoid, and we're not content with a set-presentation thereof.<br>\nThere is a work-around: work in HoTT as modeled in simplicial ∞-groupoids/spaces. Then we can work with (∞,1)-categories synthetically as complete Segal types, cf. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07442\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07442\">Riehl-Shulman</a>.<br>\nI wrote a book chapter for philosophers discussing these issues: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02177\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02177\">Higher Structures in Homotopy Type Theory</a>, and the situation is basically unchanged.
