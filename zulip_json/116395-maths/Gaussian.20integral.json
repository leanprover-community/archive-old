        "content": "<p>A few weeks ago, I wanted to experiment with the API for integrals in mathlib, and I thought the best way to do that would be to use it to prove something not trivial but reasonably easy. So here is a proof of the Gaussian integral (<code>∫ x : ℝ, real.exp (-x^2) = real.pi.sqrt</code>) : <a href=\"https://github.com/ADedecker/gauss/blob/master/src/main.lean#L336\">https://github.com/ADedecker/gauss/blob/master/src/main.lean#L336</a><br>\nAs I couldn't find variable change in 2D in mathlib, I didn't make the usual proof, and I used parametric integrals instead.</p>\n<p>The only <code>sorry</code> remaining will be removed once <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/6292\">#6292</a> gets merged.</p>\n<p>I don't know wether this should go to mathlib or not, but the <code>main.lean</code> file is definitely not PR-ready. I will do a lot of cleaning and a bit of generalizing soon, but right now I have more urgent things to do. Also, for lemmas about parametric integrals, it may be better to adapt what <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110031\">@Patrick Massot</span> did in the Sphere Eversion project, since it should give results <em>a bit</em> more general than what I took from the undergraduate course I attended last semester <span aria-label=\"sweat smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" role=\"img\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span> </p>\n<p>The <code>integral_limits.lean</code> file seems a bit closer to being PR-able, but I'm still not happy with some details of it, so feel free to have a look and give your opinions.</p>\n<p>PS : Big thanks to the authors of the measure theory part of mathlib for having made an API understandable even by people like me who don't know measure theory (yet).</p>",
