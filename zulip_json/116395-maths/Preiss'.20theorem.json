Is it relatively straightforard to state this theorem in Lean? I don't know anywhere near enough about the measure theory side of things to have a clue.</p>",

I don't think we currently have the definitions of density of a measure in \\R^n at a point, or of rectifiability of a set. That being said, I don't see any major issues to formalizing those definitions relatively easily, at which point I think it's possible to state Preiss' theorem.</p>",
