        "content": "<p>Pls let me ask another newbie question. I read that proofs are usually done outside of mathlib, and only afterwards imported. Also, only if code is imported in mathlib, it is save for future updates. How about proofs huge proofs like those from the LTE or the definitions in the perfectoid spaces, are they in mathlib? Other, more elementary proofs like the Hall's marriage problem (asking as i saw the paper and talk about it by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"303889\">@Alena Gusakov</span>), is that in mathlib or only available externally?</p>\n<p>Is there some place where i can see all defintions/theorems that are included, and progress (i.e. when new theorems are included)? I am sure this infos is available in the docs, but there is so much data for beginners, i failed atm to understand these super basic questions. Thanks :)</p>",

Also, i am curious how complex it is to generalize further to non-bipartite graphs, i.e. Tutte's Theorem?
