Currently the definition of <code>strict_mono</code> is <code>a &lt; b -&gt; f a &lt; f b</code>. This makes sense on a linear order, but seems to make less sense on a partial order than <code>a ≤ b ↔ f a ≤ f b</code>. <code>&lt;</code> really isn't used that much on partial orders anyway.  Shall we change the definition to <code>a ≤ b ↔ f a ≤ f b</code>?</p>",
