Induced category structures may not come up often in mathematics, but in Lean they can be quite convenient. For example, if the subtype is the range of a function, it's much easier to work with the function directly than working with the range, which involves an existential quantifier and an equality. This happens for the subcategory of basic open sets inside the category of all open sets in the spectrum of a ring R; the set of basic opens is the range of the function sending r : R to D(r). In <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/9802\">#9802</a>, I need to work with B-sheaves, which are (contravariant) functors from the basic opens to a value category, and it turned out it's much easier to work with functors from R to the value category, where R is equipped with the induced category structure (from the category of open sets).</p>",
