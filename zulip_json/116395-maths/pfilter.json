I have not figured out what the new version of <code>join</code> has to do with the old one (which has a different type - <code>filter (filter A)</code> becomes <code>pfilter (set (pfilter A))</code> which is not obviously related to <code>pfilter (pfilter A)</code>, which is something new).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would be surprised if the monads on <code>filter</code> and <code>pfilter</code> are related. For me the monad of filter is not what is expected (one gets the wrong products), but <code>applicative</code> is a nice structure. I don't know about <code>pfilter</code>...</p>",
