There are two ways of developing dimension theory, one that starts with Krull's principal ideal theorem, and one that starts with hilbert polynomials. The stacks project does the hilbert polynomial one, along with Atiyah-MacDonald and Matsumura. However, Bourbaki and Bruns-Herzog, and even <a href=\"http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~hochster/614F20/614Lx.pdf\">Hochster's notes</a> seem to prefer the Krull's principal ideal version, which means that perhaps this route is worth considering.</p>\n<p>Indeed, when I was thinking about doing dimension theory in Lean, I had the vague impression that trying to do Hilbert polynomials might be finicky and the principal ideal theorem route offers a quicker path to the theorems in algebraic geometry that I'm interested in. However, I am not an expert in Commutative Algebra nor am I an expert in how finicky Lean is with combinatorial polynomial identities. Perhaps the existence of free internet sources is also a factor, though hopefully Bourbaki is reasonably easy to get one's hands on.</p>",
