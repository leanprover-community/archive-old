I think this might be necessary in practice. However there is a subtlety here. The reals are defined up to unique isomorphism by being a complete ordered archimedean field; <code>Qbar</code> is only defined up to isomorphism by being an algebraic closure of the rationals, and indeed its automorphism group is a topological group with an extremely subtle structure, all of which is invariant by inner automorphisms in some sense that mathematicians are good at keeping track of</p>",
