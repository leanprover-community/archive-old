I hope new users here stay around because they like the fact that many people spend a lot of time answering questions in the new members stream. We can spend ages describing everything that is nice in Lean, and compare it to what we think we know about the other proof assistants. But the actual reason why Kevin and I are here is that we came to Gitter (that we used to chat before Zulip) and Johannes Hölzl and especially Mario Carneiro spent <em>days</em> answering all our dumb questions until we started to understand something. We both tried Coq before, and it lacked a Mario.</p>",

Mario, Simon, Johannes and Reid were key players here -- when I was getting bogged down with the basics Mario was essential, and when I was getting bogged down with technicalities of type theory when doing schemes, and the realisation that R[1/fg] was not equal to R[1/f][1/g], Reid was invaluable.</p>",
