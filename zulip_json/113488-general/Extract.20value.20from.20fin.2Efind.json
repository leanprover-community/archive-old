Together with that I would like a proof that this indeed holds, of the form <code>pk : p k</code>.<br>\nHowever if I use the <code>cases</code> tactic on <code>fin.find p</code> in the <code>some k</code> case I only get the <code>k : fin n</code> but no proof. I tried to get this proof using <code>fin.find_spec</code> but I got to the point I have to show <code>fin.find p = some k</code>, from where I don't really know where to go, as I thought this was the assumption of the case we are in.</p>",
