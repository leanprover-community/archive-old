I just tried it with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"202902\">@Anca Ciobanu</span> ; firstly she shared a session but had a .gitignore file containing things like _target, and when the session was shared her code compiled for her but not for me -- all the imports failed. We renamed her .gitignore and tried again, and this time I see her _target and also her leanpkg.path, all of which looks perfect (coincidentally, she is on a different OS so it couild have been random) but still my VS Code cannot pick up the imports. What are we doing wrong?</p>",
