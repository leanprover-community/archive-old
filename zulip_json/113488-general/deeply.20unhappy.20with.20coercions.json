If the preprocessor has found out that <code>F : functor ?M1 ?M2</code> and it needs to be of type <code>?M3 -&gt; ?M4</code> (for example, when it is applied to a term), then in Lean 3, the coercion mechanism doesn't fire yet, because for some reason, it needs to know the exact type of <code>F</code> without any metavariables in it. In Lean 2, a coercion was inserted, and then from the context, it could afterwards figure out the exact value of the metavariables.</li>\n</ul>",
