There will be a bunch of mathematicians attending the conference that have no prior experience with ITPs as far as I know. (I know at least three participants come from the Dutch arithmetic geometry community.) The goal of this workshop, and of Lean Forward in general, is to work towards ITPs that are actually used by mathematicians; and that is exactly what my goal is (and Scott's, Patrick's, Kevin's goal as well). I know that mathematicians have not shown very much dedication towards ITPs, and this might be frustrating for some people from the CS side. To make these people stay we will have to address the following issue:<br>\nThese people work with abelian schemes, Galois representations, F-isocrystals, Artin stacks, etc... these notions are not fancy for them, they are their basic Lego blocks. These concepts have been around for at least 30 years, more like 60. When they visit Johannes's talk on what's in mathlib, they will find that schemes and perfectoid spaces haven't made it into mathlib, even though Kevin (and Kenny, Patrick, me) have been working on them for around a year.<br>\nAnd then they will remember the talk from the day before, about Lean 4, and how that's around the corner. And they will hear some chat during the coffee breaks that porting to Lean 4 is going to be a bit of a nasty issue. And they will realise that none of their basic building blocks has ever made it into Coq, Isabelle, Mizar, or whatever.<br>\nSo... long story short: how are we going to convince them (and me?) that all this formalisation effort is not ephemeral, and that ITPs should stabilise in the near future?</p>",

My guess is that we are 10 years away from using \"almost mathematics\" to compare the \"etale site\" of a \"perfectoid field\" with its \"tilt\".

Since then we (Kevin, you and me) have been using Lean only part-time, and the perfectoid project began on June 2nd. More importantly, as I told you in Freiburg, we need to read again and again the second message in the perfectoid thread: <a href=\"#narrow/stream/116395-maths/subject/Perfectoid.20spaces/near/127308229\" title=\"#narrow/stream/116395-maths/subject/Perfectoid.20spaces/near/127308229\">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/subject/Perfectoid.20spaces/near/127308229</a> We asked \"what should  we do?\" to one of the (two or three?) people who worked from the beginning to the end on the single huge pure math formalization project ever.
