practitioners are invited to submit proposals for workshops on<br>\ntopics in the field of computer science, related to logic in the broad sense.<br>\nEach workshop proposal must indicate one affiliated conference of FLoC 2022.</p>\n<p>It is strongly suggested that prospective workshop organizers contact the<br>\nrelevant conference workshop chair before submitting a proposal.</p>\n<p>Each proposal should consist of the following two parts.</p>\n<p>1) A short scientific justification of the proposed topic, its significance,<br>\nand the particular benefits of the workshop to the community, as well as a<br>\nlist of previous or related workshops (if relevant).</p>\n<p>2) An organisational part including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>contact information for the workshop organizers;</li>\n<li>proposed affiliated conference;</li>\n<li>estimate of the number of workshop participants (please note that small workshops, i.e., of less than ~13 participants, will likely be cancelled or merged);</li>\n<li>proposed format and agenda (e.g. paper presentations, tutorials, demo sessions, etc.);</li>\n<li>potential invited speakers (note that expenses of workshop invited speakers are not covered by FLoC);</li>\n<li>procedures for selecting papers and participants;</li>\n<li>plans for dissemination, if any (e.g. a journal special issue);</li>\n<li>duration (which may vary from one day to two days);</li>\n<li>preferred period (pre or post FLoC);</li>\n<li>virtual/hybrid backup plans (including platform preference).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The FLoC Organizing Committee will determine the final list of accepted<br>\nworkshops based on the recommendations from the Workshop Chairs of the hosting<br>\nconferences and availability of space and facilities.</p>\n<p>Proposals should be submitted through EasyChair:<br>\n<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=floc2022workshops\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=floc2022workshops</a></p>\n<p>Please see the
