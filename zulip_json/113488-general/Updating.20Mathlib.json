I was envisaging people on the Xena summer project just playing around with basic stuff and nothing we needed getting PR'ed to mathlib. Really I just wanted to avoid having to spend hours showing people how to upgrade mathlib :-) We now run the risk that some of us will write code which will not run for others, but I guess in the long run most people have got Lean running on their laptops and it's in their interest to learn how to upgrade mathlib.</p>\n<p>One could envisage a one-click solution to all of this for Windows users. An \"upgrade mathlib\" button which just requires someone to type in their github credentials (or perhaps not even that). For mac users it's often easier because they have a terminal pre-installed, and when they install git it might well end up in a directory which is already in their path.</p>",
