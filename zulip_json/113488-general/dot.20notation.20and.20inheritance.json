Here is a basic example, with a simple class <code>basic</code>, and another class <code>extended</code> that extends it. If <code>basic</code> has a field <code>n</code>, then <code>a.n</code> works for <code>a : basic</code>, and <code>b.n</code> works for <code>b : extended</code> (I guess by some parser trickery) but it is displayed as <code>b.to_basic.n</code> in a proof state (in tactic mode). Let me now define a function <code>basic.foo</code> doing whatever. Then <code>a.foo</code> works, as well as <code>b.to_basic.foo</code>, but <code>b.foo</code> doesn't (because the parser (?) is looking for a function <code>extended.foo</code> as <code>b</code> has type <code>extended</code>).</p>",

And then I want to build local homeomorphisms. With a new style structure, I need to write <code>e.to_local_equiv</code>everywhere. With the old style structure, I need to copy my 50 lemmas to the new setting. And then when I improve local equivs by adding a lemma, or changing the order of parameters, or renaming the lemmas, then I need to update also the local homeomorphisms file, as otherwise things are not coherent any more. In both cases, this is very frustrating.</p>\n<p>I started with new style, then I got tired of all this <code>to_local_equiv</code>, so I switched to old style, but this is becoming a maintenance nightmare, so I am considering to move back to new style. Not to mention that I started without coercions, then I realized that coercions are used everywhere with respect to equivs, so I switched to coercions, but this is creating problems down the hill (coercions need the type to be fully elaborated, so I have to add a lot of annotations). So I am considering removing the coercions again... This is really hard to get right. After experimenting with everything, it seems that I will end with new style structure, and no coercion. Unless someone here convinces me to switch again :)</p>",
