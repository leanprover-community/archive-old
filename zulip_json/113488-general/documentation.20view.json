Here are two comments.</p>\n<p>The bigger one: once we move from the table of contents to a specific chapter, as far as I can tell it is impossible to go back to the table of contents without pressing ctrl-shift-P and choosing \"open documentation view\" again. That makes it less convenient to browse. I don't know the ideal solution here. Maybe the best solution is to assign a keystroke to \"open documentation view\", so that pressing that would return to the TOC.</p>\n<p>The smaller issue: the natural way to play with the text and examples is to split the screen, put the text in the left, and then run the examples in the right. But even when I have a split screen, when I click on the \"try it\" button, the window opens on the left, and I have to manually move it to the right. Would it be possible to have the window open on the right?</p>",
