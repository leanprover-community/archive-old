Later,  I wanted to update that branch to include the most recent changes to mathlib. As usual, I pulled from github then did a <code>leanproject get-cache</code>. Now, the branch won't build (I think that's the problem), with the status bar instead reading \"checking 1 file\" no matter what files I open or close, and it attempts to check that file until my  computer goes into overdrive. I rebased and tried to build the branch (I aborted the build after an exceedingly long period of time) but to no effect. <br>\nDoes anyone have any idea what the issue could be or how I could go about resolving this? If there is no obvious solution, am I able to delete this branch and download a new one and still be able to push changes to my PR from the new branch?</p>",
