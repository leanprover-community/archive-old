By the way, it raises interesting questions on the way to write a math papers when you have a formalized proof (when we need a lemma that is related, but not exactly the same, to results already in the literature, should we give the proof or just point the reader to the formalized proof?)

Computer scientists and mathematicians have two different definitions of pure mathematics. They meet at the bottom with proofs that sqrt(2) is irrational etc, but after some point the sociological aspects of mathematics start influencing our tribe, and not theirs, and this makes some things quite different. Our experts proclaim what is proved and what is not proved; we try to choose the appropriate experts for each theorem, and our experts do not always get it right. However we have things that the CS world view does not have, like a very fluid understanding of techniques, and guiding principles such as the global Langlands reciprocity \"principle\", which is not even a well-defined statement but which seems to have well-defined consequences (for example functoriality, which can certainly be made into a formal statement (in more than one way, depending on how optimistic you want to be)). We also have very different opinions on what comprises beautiful mathematics. Both communities have a lot to offer each other in the future, I believe, and the main issue stopping this from happening is that there are very few experts in one area who know any more than epsilon about the modern tools available in the other area. That's what we have to change.</p>",

I then talked a little bit about errors in the literature and also in the first half spent a bit of time philosophising about the nature of mathematics as done by humans and talking about various sociological issues which interfere with a formalist's viewpoint of what mathematics should be (I've been reading books by Bruno Latour). I then showed them Lean and some code that <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110044\">@Chris Hughes</span> wrote, stressing that he had no computing experience when he arrived at Imperial 1 year ago (I did no live coding, for tedious technical reasons -- a minor system failure there) and showed off some of my summer students' work, and finished with a plea that mathematicians and computer scientists should work together more closely in the future on a common vision for pure mathematics, because we both have things to offer the other \"tribe\".</p>\n<p>Neil Strickland was a very engaging host, he knows a lot about other proof assistants and I trusted him to provide a perhaps more unbiased view than that which I might find here (that's not an accusation -- I think people here are very level-headed in general, but many of us know more about Lean than any other system). But I definitely came away from that conversation feeling that I had not made a mistake in choosing Lean. Tom Bridgeland is another mathematician that I have a lot of respect for, and was very pleased he came to lunch with us; he also had interesting questions and comments. He pointed out that Carlos Simpson had formalised localising categories in Coq a decade ago, which I didn't know (I think of Simpson as a mathematician, and I know that most mathematicians wouldn't be able to formalise anything). In some sense the funniest thing Bridgeland said was that he didn't care less about the foundations of his subject, he just got on with it, which I thought was interesting for someone who used categories so much. I met the person who taught the introduction to proof course and told them to send me some of their problem sheets and I'd see what I could do with them.</p>",

Loved the joke about old mathematicians dying out :D (you guys do get a lot of freedom in what you can say at work!). I think what could have been valuable (maybe you said it and I missed it) was that regardless of how the proof is written, it gets compiled down to a simplified form checked by a trusted kernel. Otherwise using the backwards reasoning tactic seems a bit like a cheat!</p>",

I imagined this to be some kind of formal colimit, or the pushout of rings or similar, and so asked what it really was: he said he meant the pushout of sets.

[rendering (1) obsolete]. Basically I bailed on associativity. I think that internalising the \"two rules for addition\" (the equation lemmas) and then using them to prove what is quite a complex thing (it's a good few lines) is too hard for schoolkids.</p>\n<p>8) Proof that <code>one + one = two</code> from the axioms. This <em>worked</em>. Students could attempt to unravel what <code>one + one = two</code> means and see that the proof was <code>rfl</code>.</p>\n<p>9) Now questions. I tell them that we prove <code>a+b=b+a</code> next, and ask what happens after that. \"Definition of multiplication\" says one. Eventually I get them to come up with the following plan: define <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> on nat, define int (because someone says \"define subtraction!\" and I say \"We can't! How do we do 2 - 3?\"), define <code>+-*</code> on int, define rat (because we can't do division until we do), define <code>+-*/</code> on rat, define <code>real</code>, define <code>+-*/</code> on real. Then define <code>complex</code>.</p>\n<p>10) Show them the definition of <code>complex</code> as a pair of reals, invent stupid notation <code>[x,y]</code> for complexes because I tell them <code>x+yi</code> is not allowed because we didn't define <code>+</code> or <code>i</code> yet, then challenge them to define addition and multiplication, challenge them to prove on paper that multiplication is commutative.</p>\n<p>So essentially no induction at all, and I get to show them random bits of Lean, and I <em>think</em> that this is just about a level which works. Still needs work, but a much more positive experience than last time when I was telling people that induction on false was <code>false -&gt; P</code>.</p>",
