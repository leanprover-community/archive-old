There are 2 ways to match on a list in lean that is <code>[]</code> and <code>x :: xs</code> you can also extend the match on the <code>xs</code> part to for example <code>x :: y :: xs</code>. What you cannot do is match on a chain of appends like this and you can also not match like this <code>x :: x :: xs</code> to make sure that the first two elements of a list are equivalent. You'll have to figure that out with a seperate if statement after a <code>x :: y :: xs</code> thing.</p>\n<p>What you want to write here is</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">inductive</span> <span class=\"n\">Palindrome</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">List</span> <span class=\"n\">α</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span>  <span class=\"kt\">Type</span> <span class=\"n\">where</span>\n  <span class=\"bp\">|</span> <span class=\"n\">nil</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">Palindrome</span> <span class=\"o\">[]</span>\n  <span class=\"bp\">|</span> <span class=\"n\">single</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">α</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">Palindrome</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"o\">]</span>\n  <span class=\"bp\">|</span> <span class=\"n\">sandwich</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">α</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">Palindrome</span> <span class=\"n\">as</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">Palindrome</span> <span class=\"o\">([</span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"o\">]</span> <span class=\"bp\">++</span> <span class=\"n\">as</span> <span class=\"bp\">++</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"o\">])</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">def</span> <span class=\"n\">middle</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">l</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">List</span> <span class=\"n\">α</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"bp\">-&gt;</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">h</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">Palindrome</span> <span class=\"n\">l</span><span class=\"o\">}</span> <span class=\"bp\">-&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">Option</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">Sum</span> <span class=\"n\">α</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">List</span> <span class=\"n\">α</span><span class=\"o\">))</span>\n  <span class=\"bp\">|</span> <span class=\"n\">_</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">nil</span> <span class=\"bp\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">none</span>\n  <span class=\"bp\">|</span> <span class=\"n\">_</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">single</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"bp\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">some</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">Sum.inl</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"bp\">|</span> <span class=\"n\">_</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"bp\">@</span><span class=\"n\">Palindrome.sandwich</span> <span class=\"n\">_</span> <span class=\"n\">as</span> <span class=\"n\">_</span> <span class=\"n\">_</span> <span class=\"bp\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">some</span> <span class=\"bp\">&lt;|</span> <span class=\"n\">Sum.inr</span> <span class=\"n\">as</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>because the <code>as</code> is an implicit argument to the sandwich and not to the List itself.
