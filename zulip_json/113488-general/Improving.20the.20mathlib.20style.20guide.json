I mean that the novice's path is by no means easy, but we pretend it to be. The fact that a big theorem needs 50 lemmas (say) shows that the theorem is somewhat deep. Of these 50, some will be crucial and some will be minor; some will be specific to this theorem, some will reveal some deep property; and some will be \"technical results\". If you decide to keep the long proof, you will be forced to explain it, and to underpin the contribution of every step. If they become 50 lemmas on an equal footing, there will be no communication at all about what is \"really\" happening.

Besides, I think tactic mode has an intrinsic readability limitation : even with nicely structured proof, it is still nearly impossible for me to predict the tactic state after, e.g, a call to <code>field_simp</code>.

Once I find the interesting theorem (e.g. the main theorem), I read that part carefully and then read the dependencies of that theorem, and then those dependencies and so on in reverse order. That way, I'm always reading a theorem with the knowledge of why it would be used (which also sometimes provides additional structure or even hypotheses you can put on the dependencies, e.g. this theorem is only ever applied when <code>a</code> is prime even though it only says <code>a</code> is odd in the theorem statement.</p>",
