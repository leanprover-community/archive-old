Then n has at least two positive prime factors, say p1 and p2, so that n = p1p2k for some positive integer k. By hypothesis, n has no positive prime divisors less than or equal to sqrt(n). Hence p1 &gt; sqrt(n) and p2 &gt; sqrt(n). Hence n = p1p2k &gt;= p1*p2 &gt;n. Contradiction.</p>\n<p>I am new to lean, so I am trying to translate proofs in textbooks for practice. Can anyone please tell me how to translate this proof into Lean code?</p>",
