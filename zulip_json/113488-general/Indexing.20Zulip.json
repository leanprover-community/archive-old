It's hard to find answers to Lean questions online right now. You have to register and search here specifically. </p>\n<p>I wrote a little script that will scrape the public streams here and post them to an openly accessible site. You can see a sample here: <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive</a></p>\n<p>Before I spend more time on this, I wanted to check with people -- are there any objections on privacy grounds? I'm displaying strictly less information than is available openly to anyone who registers for Zulip -- no email addresses, no pictures. To me it seems comparable to the archive of an email list, which is often public and indexed. </p>\n<p>If there are no objections, I'll finish the script and put up a whole archive. New posts will be added every time the script runs. I don't have a reliable server to automate this; my plan was just to run the script when I think about it, since there's nothing time sensitive, but if anyone has a better plan I'm listening. I also don't have the time to waste on web design. So if anyone wants to mess with the css, Jekyll setup, etc, let's talk.</p>",

There are a few outstanding issues:<br>\n- Lean syntax highlighting. This is a pipeline issue: there's a PR to Rouge that needs to be merged, and then Github needs to update.<br>\n- Parsing urls. Zulip's markdown parser is different from the options in Jekyll, which will only convert urls to links if they're enclosed in &lt; &gt;. Oh well, I'm not going to fix this.<br>\n- Malformed posts. Some of you like to write posts that end with code blocks and leave off the closing backticks (<a href=\"#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/invalid%20%27calc%27%3A%20transitivity%20rule/near/125130159\" title=\"#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/invalid%20%27calc%27%3A%20transitivity%20rule/near/125130159\">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/invalid%20%27calc%27%3A%20transitivity%20rule/near/125130159</a>), which leads to this: <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/113488general/90773invalidcalctransitivityrule.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/113488general/90773invalidcalctransitivityrule.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/113488general/90773invalidcalctransitivityrule.html</a> I'm not sure what to do here.</p>\n<p>It's possible to let Zulip process the markdown instead, but then I need to write css to match it's output, and I hate writing css.</p>",
