This is a sign that activity is booming, and we are very happy about that! But it is also causing a lot of unnecessary stress among the community because of neglected PRs, PRs blocking progress, etc...<br>\nAs maintainers we are aware of this \"minor crisis\", and we want to come with a scalable long-term solution. Please bear with us for a few more days while we develop a proposal, and stay tuned! -- The maintainer team</p>",
