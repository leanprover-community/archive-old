If we ban <code>omega</code>, we can port mathlib more easily to Lean 4 (we don't need to port <code>omega</code> before porting the library). We could still write <code>omega</code> in Lean 4 after the initial port.<br>\nRelated PR: <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7646\">#7646</a></p>",
