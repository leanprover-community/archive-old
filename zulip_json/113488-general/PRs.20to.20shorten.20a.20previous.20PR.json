Throughout the morning, I have been producing several (very short) PRs:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7866\">#7866</a> -- approved, thanks Johan!<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7868\">#7868</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7870\">#7870</a> -- approved, thanks Johan!<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7871\">#7871</a> -- introduces a new lemma<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7872\">#7872</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7873\">#7873</a></p>\n<p>The main reason for these PRs is to shorten PR <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7645\">#7645</a>, by reducing the number of touched files.</p>\n<p>My question now is if this is good or bad behaviour!  My instinct is to bundle together tiny changes into a bigger one, but I am slowly getting accustomed to the practice of producing several small, incremental changes.</p>\n<p>Please, feel free to tell me whether these PRs are ok/silly, and whether I should continue/stop with them!</p>",

The PRs are certainly independent among them (unless I am mistaken, they only change <em>proofs</em> of existing lemmas/instances, with possibly one exception that introduces a new lemma).  I have been consistently merging them back into their bigger brother and fixing conflicts, when they arose.  So, hopefully, I should be ok from that point of view!</p>",
