I'm thinking like LN for Coq: <a href=\"http://www.chargueraud.org/softs/ln/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.chargueraud.org/softs/ln/\">http://www.chargueraud.org/softs/ln/</a> - Context is that I'd like to prove some properties about my language Pikelet.

        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"117066\">@Brendan Zabarauskas</span>!</p>\n<p>I'm currently working on a Lean proof of part of the Coq locally nameless library predecessor to the one you've linked to. I've forked <a href=\"https://github.com/spl/formal_binders\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/spl/formal_binders\">that library</a> for my own reference. The reason I'm using the predecessor is because it had the Core ML typing formalization example, which seems to have been lost. (Also, are you familiar with <a href=\"https://github.com/plclub/metalib\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/plclub/metalib\">Metalib</a>, a successor to that library?)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/spl/tts/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/spl/tts/\">My own work</a> is currently strictly focused on what I need to get working for my research. However, I have certainly thought about making it useful more generally. As it is, I try to push into <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/\">mathlib</a> small improvements/additions that have helped me as I go. I think that the better mathlib gets — and it is well-maintained! — the less one needs another library.</p>\n<p>All that said, it will probably be a lot of work to formalize what you need in Lean. There's a lot of existing knowledge, including libraries/frameworks, of how to do it in Coq. But I do find Lean easier to use, faster to compile, and more enjoyable. If you do plan on trying it out, you may want to take at look at <a href=\"https://github.com/spl/tts/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/spl/tts/\">my work</a>. It's still in progress, but I'll do my best to answer questions or help out.</p>",

I'll check out your stuff.</p>\n<p>I definitely find the ergonomics of Lean much more pleasant than Coq, but the ecosystem is still lacking. In the future I will definitely start needing some kind of separation logic, but earlier on I can probably get by without (need to tackle the higher level metatheory before then).</p>",
