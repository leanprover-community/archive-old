I've yet to see a single large public Discord community with many active contributors that is anything but endless spam, noise and incomprehensibly interleaved arguments and topics of discussion. Discord threads also don't seem to work nearly as well as Zulip threads do, mostly because nobody is willing to use them. I'm convinced that this community simply wouldn't exist as it does now on any of the other platform.</p>\n<p>FWIW, I feel like this Zulip already strikes a decent balance between casual and professional conversations about Lean, with the only downside being that you create new topics every once in a while when a conversation gets too off-topic. That probably disincentivizes posting your every thought, but as far as I'm concerned (I spend most of my time here reading, not posting), that's a benefit <span aria-label=\"grinning\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f600\" role=\"img\" title=\"grinning\">:grinning:</span></p>\n<p>The only thing that's perhaps missing is some kind of strictly off-topic stream, and I'm not sure whether a chat or a topic format would be better suited for that, or whether it's desirable at all.</p>",

Even Discord threads are meant to die out after a few days (they literally have a validity deadline). Whatever was said 1~2 weeks ago in Discord doesn't matter anymore.</p>\n<p>In contrary, the interaction speed needed for discussions involving Lean is way slower.
