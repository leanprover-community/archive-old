If you're happy with the command line then you can <code>git log</code> to see the most recent commits on your branch, and <code>leanproject get-mathlib-cache</code> will only work for a commit which has been pushed to github and which CI has compiled. The --rev trick says \"try the last but n commit\" but of course the problem with this is that all files which you edited since that commit, and all the files they depend on, will still need to be compiled at your end. You can just compile manually with <code>lean --make src</code> and if you have some kind of feeling for the import hierarchy you'll be able to see how long it might take to finish. Compiling from scratch can take a couple of hours on a modest machine if you've edited a file high up in the hierarchy.</p>",
