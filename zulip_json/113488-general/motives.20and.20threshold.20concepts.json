I've done my best to motivate the motive concept in the special case of eliminators on <code>nat</code>. I plan to do a follow-up post looking at other inductive types.</p>\n<p>From a pedagogical perspective, I posit that having to treat a particular mathematical object as both <em>having</em> a type and <em>being</em> a type raises similar challenges to those faced by students needing to treat an object simultaneously as being a set and being an element of a set.</p>",
