        "content": "<p>I am definitely very grateful to Mario for everything he does, but there is one question I want to raise on mathlib style. In general programming practice, comments are considered good, and even necessary. In lean, you can have lean-checked comments, in the form of <code>have</code>or <code>show</code>statements which, while unncessary to the compiler, increase a lot maintainability, readability, reusability (I mean, if you want to adapt a proof to suit your needs and you see what the proof is doing, then this is much easier), and make the learning curve less steep (by browsing through understandable code, one understands better what is going on). But this is at the price of compactness, or golfedness, which is very much valued in mathlib. </p>\n<p>Let me take a simple example, for the sake of the discussion. Suppose one wants to prove a statement by applying lemma <code>foo</code>, which gives rise to two subgoals <code>subgoal 1</code> and <code>subgoal 2</code>, whose proofs are both nontrivial. The mathlib canonical version (M) would be:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>  <span class=\"n\">refine</span> <span class=\"n\">foo</span> <span class=\"bp\">_</span> <span class=\"bp\">_</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"o\">{</span> <span class=\"n\">rather</span> <span class=\"n\">lengthy</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">proof</span> <span class=\"n\">of</span> <span class=\"n\">subgoal</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"o\">},</span>\n  <span class=\"o\">{</span> <span class=\"n\">rather</span> <span class=\"n\">lengthy</span> <span class=\"k\">proof</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">of</span> <span class=\"n\">subgoal</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span> <span class=\"o\">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>(or if you could even put some part of the proof in the first line, maybe go for it, for instance if the proof of <code>subgoal 1</code> starts with the introduction of variables <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> maybe write <code>refine foo (λ x y, _) _</code> in the first line)</p>\n<p>But you could imagine more verbose versions such as (V1):</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>  <span class=\"n\">refine</span> <span class=\"n\">foo</span> <span class=\"bp\">_</span> <span class=\"bp\">_</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">show</span> <span class=\"n\">subgoal</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"o\">{</span> <span class=\"n\">rather</span> <span class=\"n\">lengthy</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">proof</span> <span class=\"n\">of</span> <span class=\"n\">subgoal</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"o\">},</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">show</span> <span class=\"n\">subgoal</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"o\">{</span> <span class=\"n\">rather</span> <span class=\"n\">lengthy</span> <span class=\"k\">proof</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">of</span> <span class=\"n\">subgoal</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span> <span class=\"o\">}</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>where the <code>show</code>lines are meant as completely unncessary comments. Or even (V2):</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>  <span class=\"k\">have</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">subgoal</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"o\">{</span> <span class=\"n\">rather</span> <span class=\"n\">lengthy</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">proof</span> <span class=\"n\">of</span> <span class=\"n\">subgoal</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"o\">},</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">have</span> <span class=\"n\">B</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">subgoal</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"o\">{</span> <span class=\"n\">rather</span> <span class=\"n\">lengthy</span> <span class=\"k\">proof</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">of</span> <span class=\"n\">subgoal</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span> <span class=\"o\">},</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">exact</span> <span class=\"n\">foo</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span> <span class=\"n\">B</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>(M) is definitely more compact, but in my opinion (V1) or (V2) are preferable. And using (V1) or (V2) can depend on the intent: if the punchline is that one should use the lemma <code>foo</code>, I would put it at the beginning of the argument as in (V1), but if it is obvious that one should use <code>foo</code> and the hard part is checking the subgoals then I would rather go for (V2). Pros: more readable, maintainable, reusable. Cons: more verbose, slightly slower compilation time (?)</p>\n<p>Anyway, I understand that the mathlib-ready version for now is (M), but I would really much like this to change. I am just starting the discussion, let me know what you think of it.</p>\n<p>TLDR; I like code with a lot of <code>have</code> and <code>show</code> (at least one every sixth or seventh line?), and I would like to see more of them in mathlib. What do you think?</p>",

        "content": "<p>My impression of these <code>show</code> lines is that they are mostly superfluous (there are ways to make a <code>show</code> do some work but I think we can agree that the question here is about the ones that are unnecessary for lean). Lean proofs (or at least mathlib proofs) aren't really intended to be read without the aid of lean in the background to give you side information. If we wanted to change that, a <code>show</code> line here and there wouldn't be nearly enough anyway. But assuming that the user has access to a lean server, comments about the current goal and the types of variables is quite redundant. It reminds me of the classic \"bad C comment\":</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>int i = 1; // set i to 1\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>There are much better uses for comments, like explaining <em>why</em> you are proving what you are. The Arzela-Ascoli theorem has several comments along these lines, and I think they are useful. But saying information that is already present seems like a waste of space.</p>",
