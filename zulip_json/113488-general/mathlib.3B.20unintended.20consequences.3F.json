Of course, hopefully this is going to happen just on the merits of Lean 4 as an amazingly flexible and fast functional programming language. But I do think it's worth worrying for a moment that mathlib's success may have actually <em>hurt</em> Lean 3's adoption to this point, and to make sure, if this is the case, that we don't repeat it.</p>\n<p>The way in which mathlib-the-library may actually have hurt lean3-the-language is precisely that it is the only game in town. For good reasons, it's big, and unified, and gets a lot of attention. But this also means that someone coming to Lean3 who is not motivated primarily by \"let's formalise some mathematics / experiment with what formalisation can do / investigate how formalisation can be used in teaching\" may well be turned off, when they see (fairly or not) that \"this is all we're interested in\". I think for people who've been in the community for a few years, it's pretty easy to come up with examples where this may have been in play.</p>\n<p>How could we address this?</p>\n<p>An interesting example that was recently mentioned on a Lean4 thread was a crypto library. In some sense much of what is in a crypto library (as exists in many programming languages) is fair game for mathlib.  The way it would be developed here would be a bit weird for a crypto library (we'd never bother formalising properties of padding schemes, and we might accidentally mark some essential algorithms <code>noncomputable</code>...) but even if you ignore that, it might be completely unusable as a crypto library merely because no one would want to include a 42mb zip file full of proofs about the Hahn-Banach theorem, etc., in order to run Diffie-Hellman. </p>\n<p>Of course there's no obstacle to someone writing a \"conventional\" crypto library in either Lean 3, or more likely in Lean 4, but hopefully this example illustrates the problem that Leo was raising: could the desire for a giant mathlib repo that contains all the maths underlying a crypto library (as well as a zillion other things), actually inhibit potential users/contributors to the language ecosystem from building a more focused library?</p>",

        "content": "<p>I think we should try to design mathlib such that a file-dependency approach like Oliver mentions works well. That will mostly solve the problem of \"crypto library has unneeded dependencies\".</p>\n<p>Regarding inclusion of a crypto library in mathlib, that has always been within scope, at least the way I envision it; it's just that there aren't that many CS folks contributing to mathlib due largely to the way publicity has gone. There are some things like verified hashmaps but lean 3 is slow enough that it's fairly unrealistic to imagine that such libraries will be used in practice. Lean 4 changes the ball game here; fast <em>and</em> verified code is no longer a pipe dream.</p>\n<p>Regarding splitting mathlib into projects using typeclasses to abstract over representation: this works only in very specific contexts and generally makes reasoning a lot more complicated, so I would only employ it when necessary. For sure something like <code>linarith</code> could be written in that style, but for example abstracting over types that are the integers seems like a bad idea because it promotes the existence of multiple integer types, which is exactly what the monolithic mathlib design is intended to prevent: we want <em>one</em> <code>int</code>, <em>one</em> <code>real</code> and so on so that things can interoperate. Those types are defined with low dependencies so that they can be used in more contexts. But I don't think that there is any neat separation of mathlib into weakly connected components except \"tactics\" / \"most of mathlib\" / \"category theory\" (and we have the graphs to prove it), so a hypothetical crypto library should be able to ad hoc define its own requirements by depending only on certain files that don't live too high up in the tree.</p>",
