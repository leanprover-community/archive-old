Is there a website where you have listed all of the definitions and theorems you want to implement? With updates when they are implemented? </p>\n<p>Also, after a theorem or definition is defined in Lean, can it be used in the formalization of other definitions/theorems?</p>\n<p>Are there also some funded projects in Lean (for instane, a bounty on some certain theorems/proofs)?</p>",
