The <code>is_pullback</code> type is useful to express concepts like \"the functor G : D -&gt; C preserves pullbacks\", that is, \"the image under G of a pullback diagram is again a pullback\", especially in the absence of completeness assumptions on D and C. In terms of just <code>pullback</code>, the conclusion would have to include an existential and a bunch of equalities.</p>\n<p>All of Scott's versions in the file linked above follow this form.

The biggest effect will be when constructing <code>is_pullback</code> values, since as far as I know the record <code>{ ... }</code> notation can only be used with the actual fields of the structure. For this reason alone, maybe taking the \"explicit\" version as the definition would be preferable, as it has the most fields (there's not much pain in using an explicit function as an \"alternative constructor\", when that function has just one or two arguments).</p>\n<p>I did find both the \"explicit\" and \"bijective\" styles useful in different situations. I'm slightly surprised that <code>obviously</code> was able to provide all the limit constructions for the category of sets, I mean, types, using any of the definition styles. I guess <code>tauto</code> is pretty good at guessing how to do product-type constructions. I suspect if you tried to build colimits, you'd need to do more hand-holding. At any rate, when I proved that topological spaces have coproducts and coequalizers, I found it easier to do the construction using the \"explicit\" style; when I thought about what I would need to do in the \"bijective\" style, it amounted to checking the \"explicit\" style conditions first anyways. On the other hand, for proving facts about colimits, I made use of the \"bijective\" style using some <code>bij_on</code> machinery. This wasn't that easy to set up, but I'm reasonably happy with how the proofs turned out. They seem preferable to endless diagram chases--unless possibly the computer can just do the entire diagram chasing argument, in which case I won't complain about how long it is!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
