The value has no semantic meaning, so it doesn't matter if one or zero is picked. But I don't think that a typeclass search for <code>inhabited</code> should go on an algebraic quest to prove that it's an R-module just because that implies it's inhabited. It would be better to have the types themselves register as inhabited, to keep it simple.</p>",
