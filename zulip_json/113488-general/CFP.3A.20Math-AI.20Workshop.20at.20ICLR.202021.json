Please consider to submit a paper.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"http://mathai-iclr.github.io/\">http://mathai-iclr.github.io/</a></p>\n<p>Call for Papers:</p>\n<p>The Math-AI workshop is intended to provide a forum for discussing missing elements and major bottlenecks towards demonstrating mathematical reasoning ability in AI systems. We hope that the outcome of the workshop will lead us in meaningful directions towards a generic approach to mathematical reasoning, and shed light on general reasoning mechanisms for artificial intelligence. In particular, we are interested but not limited to the following areas of questions:<br>\nMathematical reasoning vs. general intelligence?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>What is a potential path from mathematical reasoning to general artificial intelligence?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is special about mathematical reasoning compared to other reasoning tasks?</li>\n<li>What are the pros and cons of studying mathematical reasoning?</li>\n<li>Can the lessons learned from mathematical reasoning generalize to other reasoning tasks?</li>\n<li>What machine learning techniques are we missing in the quest for machines that perform mathematical reasoning?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How to deal with large action space – hopeless exploration in mathematical reasoning?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How to design methods that allow flexible planning and jumpy reasoning?</li>\n<li>How to collect large scale datasets for mathematical reasoning?</li>\n<li>Can one augment the dataset by designing good synthetic datasets?</li>\n<li>How do we utilize informal mathematical datasets?</li>\n<li>Human-like theorem proving vs formal theorem proving using ITPs (interactive theorem provers), trade-offs?</li>\n<li>Do we need a special theorem proving assistant for machine learning?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are also interested in works on other reasoning problems that share similar structures, and can bring great insights to mathematical reasoning, such as</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Program synthesis</li>\n<li>Code verification</li>\n<li>Retrosynthesis problem</li>\n<li>Text games</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Important Dates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Paper submission opens:  Jan 26, 11:59PM PST </li>\n<li>Deadline for paper submission: Feb 26, 11:59PM PST</li>\n<li>Review decisions released: March 26, 11:59PM PST</li>\n<li>Deadline for camera ready: April 26, 11:59PM PST</li>\n<li>Workshop: May 8, 2019</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Speakers &amp; Panelists:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yoshua Bengio, MILA.</li>\n<li>Timothy Gowers, Collège de France.</li>\n<li>Mateja Jamnik, University of Cambridge</li>\n<li>Jay McClelland, Stanford University</li>\n<li>Alison Pease, University of Dundee</li>\n<li>Stanislas Polu, OpenAI</li>\n<li>Markus Rabe, Google</li>\n<li>Christian Szegedy, Google</li>\n<li>Josef Urban, CIIRC</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Organizers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kshitij Bansal, Google</li>\n<li>John Harrison, Amazon</li>\n<li>Wenda Li, University of Cambridge</li>\n<li>David McAllester, TTI Chicago</li>\n<li>Melanie Mitchell, Santa Fe Institute</li>\n<li>Yuhuai (Tony) Wu, University of Toronto</li>\n</ul>",
