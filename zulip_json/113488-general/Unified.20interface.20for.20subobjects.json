Typeclasses come close, but you can't write down which implicits are allowed to differ: you can't do <code>to_additive</code> with them because there's no way to say \"let <code>X</code> be either an <code>add_comm_monoid</code> or a <code>comm_monoid</code> and <code>Y</code> the same (but not <code>X</code> additive and <code>Y</code> multiplicative)\".
