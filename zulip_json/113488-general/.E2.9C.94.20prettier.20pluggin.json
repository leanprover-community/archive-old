As for the interface, it would be a minor amount of work to write a command-line wrapper which parses a Lean 4 file and outputs the pretty-printed/formatted version. The only caveat is, afaik this isn't very configurable, so it would be closer to e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/psf/black\">Black</a> than <a href=\"https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html\">clang-format</a>.</p>",
