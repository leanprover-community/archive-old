You can find the docs here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cuppajoeman.github.io/mathlib_docs/\">https://cuppajoeman.github.io/mathlib_docs/</a></p>\n<p>the source is here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/cuppajoeman/mathlib_docs\">https://github.com/cuppajoeman/mathlib_docs</a></p>\n<p>if you want to experiment with different colors feel free to tweak them using the inspector like this: <a href=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/940035706556932197/940268593118085190/simplescreenrecorder-2022-02-07_10.29.08.mp4\">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/940035706556932197/940268593118085190/simplescreenrecorder-2022-02-07_10.29.08.mp4</a> . The customized version of the css is in the above repo in the <code>custom.css</code> file. Most of the changes are just variable names in the :root selector.</p>\n<p>In the original docs we had the following color scheme for these types (in order):</p>\n<p>def, theorem, axiom&amp;constant, structure&amp;inductive, background</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/UKM3sMsEvItzJNqgNlQ4pTRz/image.png\">image.png</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/UKM3sMsEvItzJNqgNlQ4pTRz/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/UKM3sMsEvItzJNqgNlQ4pTRz/image.png\"></a></div><p>to go with the dark theme I've changed them to be :</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/-4Mcdw2E6tdpTr9ejY_Vykvk/image.png\">image.png</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/-4Mcdw2E6tdpTr9ejY_Vykvk/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/-4Mcdw2E6tdpTr9ejY_Vykvk/image.png\"></a></div><p>Julian from discord was hinting at being able to have the browser choose which colorscheme to use:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Julian: This is great -- just in case you don't already know, you could also follow what the browser requests here too (i.e. dark if the browser requests a dark theme, original light if it requests a light one)<br>\n Julian: I don't know what the media query looks like for that but I know of things that do so, so you could crib their CSS (notably furo from Python: <a href=\"https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo\">https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But I also think it would be nice to have a switch on the docs page if possible.</p>\n<p>Once we have a method to switch between them I think we should make a PR onto the <code>doc-gen</code> repo.</p>",
