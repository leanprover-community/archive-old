So I renamed <code>basic.lean</code> to <code>00-basic.lean</code> and then I found that I couldn't import it any more (I could open it, I just couldn't import it). Is this expected behaviour? I renamed it <code>level-00-basic.lean</code> but still it didn't seem to work. Is this also expected behaviour? Unlike the tutorial project, I need to import previous files to make later files work. Is there any way of indicating which order they should be tackled in, or should I have unnumbered files, and then numbered files for the exercises, which are copies, and which import the unnumbered files?</p>",
