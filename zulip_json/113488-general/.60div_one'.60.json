Of course, <code>sub_zero</code> becomes the <code>to_additive</code> version of this, so I removed the explicit <code>sub_zero</code> lemma.</p>\n<p>The question is about the name.  <code>div_one</code> is already taken by the analogous lemma for a <code>group_with_zero</code>.  Are there any reason to prefer the prime to stay where it is or to change to the <code>group</code> lemma?  My personal view is that the lemma for <code>group_with_zero</code> feels more like the primed version.  However, the fact that the version for <code>group</code>s has not been used yet in mathlib suggests that it is more useful and thus deserving a shorter name.</p>\n<p>Any opinions?</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
