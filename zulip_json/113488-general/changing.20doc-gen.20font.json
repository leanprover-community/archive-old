The way to fix this in the infoview is by using a font like \"dejavu sans mono\"; however, this is not on Google Fonts, which the current docgen uses for webfonts (and is likely much faster than locally, because of caching). So I thought i'd look for other options - what font do you all use for the infoview that avoids this issue?</p>",
