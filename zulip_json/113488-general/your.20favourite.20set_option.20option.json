I just learnt another one today from the conversation Sebastien and Gabriel were having about metavariables. Here's my list of cool <code>set_option</code> stuff which I as a non-tactic-writing intermediate level Lean user have found helpful in the past:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>see the gory details of everything<br>\n<code>set_option pp.all true</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>some metavariable thing which I haven't understood properly yet but looks interesting<br>\n<code>set_option pp.instantiate_mvars false</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>see how simp did it:<br>\n<code>set_option trace.simplify.rewrite true</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Why are these not defeq / why is <code>rfl</code> failing?<br>\n<code>set_option trace.type_context.is_def_eq true</code><br>\n<code>set_option trace.type_context.is_def_eq_detail true</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>why isn't typeclass resolution working?<br>\n<code>set_option trace.class_instances true</code></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Are there any others that people secretly use and which I don't know about? I remember once typing something into Lean and seeing every single option (that's something else I can never remember how to do) but that there were basically too many to comprehend, and I suspect that a user like me never needs to know most of them. The above ones are things which might help me if I'm stuck just writing a regular tactic proof.</p>",
