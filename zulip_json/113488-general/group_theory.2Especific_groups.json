So far, I could see the second half of <code>order_of_element</code> which deals with cyclic groups being there, but also <code>dihedral_group</code> and <code>quaternion_group</code>. One could also think about migrating some groups from other folders like <code>special_linear_group</code> but that is maybe more controversial. What do you think?</p>",
