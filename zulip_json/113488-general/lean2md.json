Note that the part of Alectryon that flips comments around is a single file, with its own CLI and no dependencies on the rest of the software, so you can use <code>alectryon/literate.py</code> directly if you're not interested in the rendering.  Even then your solution is very neat and short (Alectryon's implementation spends a lot of effort on the reverse direction, which needs to keep track of things like indentation :'(, nested comments, and positions, which makes it much longer and less pleasant to debug)</p>",
