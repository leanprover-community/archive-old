        "content": "<p>Suppose X is a topological add comm monoid where every sum converges. First, suppose that a + b = 0. Then the infinite sum a + b + a + b + ... converges to a and also to 0, so if we assume X is Hausdorff then a = 0 (and b = 0). Thus we can define an order by a &lt;= b iff \\ex c, a + c = b, and this order is reflexive and transitive (it's divisibility) and a &lt;= 0 -&gt; a = 0.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if <code>a &lt;= b</code> and <code>b &lt;= a</code>, then given <code>a + c = b</code> and <code>b + d = a</code>, <code>a + c + d + c + d + ...</code> converges to both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, so <code>a = b</code>. Thus the order is a partial order. There is also a top element <code>T = \\sum a : X, a</code>. Thus it is an ordered monoid, except that cancellation fails. Assuming X is nonzero, T is non-cancellative, since T + 0 = T + T but T =/= 0. The non-cancellative elements are upward closed.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of examples of where this is not a total order, such as the one I gave above (which starts 0, 1, 3/2, and so 1 and 3/2 are incomparable). So let us assume it is. Then the countable suprema can be expressed as sums / limits of finite sub-sums: If <code>a n</code> is an increasing sequence and <code>a n + b n = a (n+1)</code>, then <code>a 0 + sum n, b n</code> is the sup of the <code>a n</code>.</p>\n<p>Let N(a) be the sum of countably many copies of a. This is also the sum of any infinite family of copies of a, because it's still just the limit of n*a for n : nat. This always produces an idempotent, and <code>b &lt;= N(a)</code> implies <code>N(a) + b = N(a)</code>. If a set <code>S</code> satisfies the property that for every <code>a \\in S</code>, there is <code>b \\in S</code> with <code>N(a) &lt;= b</code>, then the supremum of S is just the sum of the members of S. If not, say <code>a \\in S</code> has the property that <code>b &lt; N(a)</code> for all b in S, then either <code>N(a)</code> is the supremum of S, or for some n <code>n*a</code> is not an upper bound and <code>n*a + a</code> is. So we add n copies of a and then iterate to find the supremum of <code>{b | n*a + b \\in S}</code>. The iteration is by transfinite induction using a well ordering of X, since we never pick the same element twice since they are decreasing in the natural order. The result is a supremum for the whole set S.</p>\n<p>Thus X is a complete lattice. But now I'm out of time, characterization coming soon...</p>",
