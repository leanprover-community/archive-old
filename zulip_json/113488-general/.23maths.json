A week or so ago I was posting on <code>#maths</code> and noticed that there were some Imperial UGs whose names were greyed out on the right. This means they're not subscribed to the stream, even though they were here explicitly because I told them to come to Zulip to talk in <code>#maths</code>. Looking at it now I see that <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"121918\">@Edward Ayers</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116065\">@Hoang Le Truong</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"121150\">@JIANXIONG SUN</span> , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"118106\">@Ali Barkhordarian</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"120634\">@Anas Lasri</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"120884\">@Clara List</span> , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"120610\">@Cosmin Stanciu</span> , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"119741\">@Fran√ßois G.
