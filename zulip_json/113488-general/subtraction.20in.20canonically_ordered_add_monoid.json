In that case <code>a - b</code> is always the minimal <code>c</code> such that <code>a &lt;= b + c</code>.<br>\nI think we should just redefine <code>canonically_ordered_add_monoid</code> so that it extends <code>has_sub</code>, and try to prove as much as we can in full generality, to avoid duplication in every individual instance. <br>\nThere might be things that depend on the linearity of the order, but I see that we recently got <code>canonically_linear_ordered_add_monoid</code>, so we can prove some lemmas for that class. Side note: <code>canonically_linear_ordered_add_monoid</code> is defined but has no instances. We should upgrade some <code>canonically_ordered_add_monoid</code> instances to it.</p>",
