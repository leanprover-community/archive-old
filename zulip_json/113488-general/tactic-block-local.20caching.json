It doesn't save-restore computed proofs like the other code I was spruiking a while ago unfortunately, which doesn't work via this method. Saving and loading expressions is so slow from within lean that barring a small modification to lean which adds io functions which do that for you from C++, I don't think it could be possible in vanilla.</p>",
