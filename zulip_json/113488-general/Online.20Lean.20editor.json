After replacing the \"library.zip\", I can import the files in mathlib. But when I try to import \"xenalib.M1P1\", it says \"file '/library/xenalib/M1P1.lean' not found\". The auto complete realises that this file exists when I'm trying to write the import, but it can't import it. I can't figure out what is going on. Is there something I'm missing ?</p>",
