Then this is transformed into the list [A, A, B]. Then we take sublists [], [B], [A], [A, B], [A], [A, B], [A, A], [A, A, B]. Note that [A} and [A, B] occur twice in this list. So the antidiagonal of f would end up being<br>\n(A -&gt; 0, B-&gt;0), (A-&gt;2, B-&gt;1) with multiplicity 1<br>\n(A -&gt; 1, B-&gt;0), (A-&gt;1, B-&gt;1) with multiplicity 2<br>\n(A -&gt; 2, B-&gt;0), (A-&gt;0, B-&gt;1) with multiplicity 1<br>\n(A -&gt; 0, B-&gt;1), (A-&gt;2, B-&gt;0) with multiplicity 1<br>\n(A -&gt; 1, B-&gt;1), (A-&gt;1, B-&gt;0) with multiplicity 2<br>\n(A -&gt; 2, B-&gt;1), (A-&gt;0, B-&gt;0) with multiplicity 1</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the multiplicity of any value (g_1, g_2) in <code>antidiagonal f</code> is just product of (f x choose g_1 k) over all values x in the support of f.
