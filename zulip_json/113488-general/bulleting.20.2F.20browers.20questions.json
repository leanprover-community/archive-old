For the moment it uses the latest nightly versions of both, though at some point we may decide to do version pinning.</li>\n<li>The UI has been changed (hopefully for the better?).</li>\n<li>You can input a URL to a Lean file at the top and the editor will start with that file open (provided the file is available via a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS\">cross-origin request</a>, e.g. if you link to a \"raw\" file on github).</li>\n<li>It uses a different strategy for caching the Lean library files.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unfortunately, both versions of the Lean web editor are broken in recent versions of Safari due to <a href=\"https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201028\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=201028\">an issue in WebKit's handling of WebAssembly</a>. Both Firefox and Chrome should work decently well for both.</p>\n<p>As for \"bulleting\", I only have a little bit of experience with Coq, but I think the equivalent in Lean is using curly braces to \"focus\" on a goal; e.g.:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"kn\">example</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">A</span> <span class=\"n\">B</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Prop</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">ha</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">hb</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">B</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span> <span class=\"bp\">âˆ§</span> <span class=\"n\">B</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span>\n<span class=\"k\">begin</span>\n<span class=\"n\">split</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n<span class=\"o\">{</span> <span class=\"n\">exact</span> <span class=\"n\">ha</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"o\">},</span>\n<span class=\"o\">{</span> <span class=\"n\">exact</span> <span class=\"n\">hb</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"o\">},</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">end</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>(<a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-web-editor/#code=example%20%28A%20B%20%3A%20Prop%29%20%28ha%20%3A%20A%29%20%28hb%20%3A%20B%29%20%3A%20A%20%E2%88%A7%20B%20%3A%3D%0Abegin%0Asplit%2C%0A%7B%20exact%20ha%2C%20%7D%2C%0A%7B%20exact%20hb%2C%20%7D%2C%0Aend\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-web-editor/#code=example%20%28A%20B%20%3A%20Prop%29%20%28ha%20%3A%20A%29%20%28hb%20%3A%20B%29%20%3A%20A%20%E2%88%A7%20B%20%3A%3D%0Abegin%0Asplit%2C%0A%7B%20exact%20ha%2C%20%7D%2C%0A%7B%20exact%20hb%2C%20%7D%2C%0Aend\">Here's a web editor link</a>.)</p>",

The downside is that the free version can be a little sluggish, although it didn't bother me that much. The upsides are that you get a lot of course management features, Lean runs on CoCalc's server instead of in JavaScript, and the editor feels more professional than the default Lean web editor. (I don't mean to insult the people working on the web editor. The CoCalc editor really serves a different purpose and is literally professional software.)</p>",

Alternatively you could pay for a far smaller course and then offer the chance to the students to sign up -- you might find that many are not interested, or find it too hard. Lean is very hard to learn unless you put the effort in. It's easy to forget how difficult the learning curve is if you've played around with it and got the hang of it. One comment I heard from <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"134231\">@Athina</span> was that learning how to use Lean at the same time as learning new mathematics is very difficult, and people might fare better learning Lean with mathematics they already know.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116034\">@William Stein</span> did I get that bit right about the individual account?</p>",

You could start small and flexibly have only some students use CoCalc.   It's easy to change how your cocalc project upgrades are allocated at any time.  Also the price for a year is really a full 12-month year (not just a semester), in case that's not clear.</p>",

My current 1st year course has &gt;300 students. Of course, it may be that &lt;=250 engage with Lean, but I'd rather know what the possibilities are.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it's unrealistic, but I feel that the less able 1st year students would benefit most from Lean. When marking 1st year exams, I often see incorrect 'proofs' that the composite of two injective functions is injective. I suspect these students think their proof is correct, but have no mechanism to tell them otherwise (other than waiting for an unreliable human tutor).</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"134231\">@Athina</span>  : have you published your paper, or have a pre-print?
