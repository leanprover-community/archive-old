I was hoping I would be able to figure this out from the Lean 3 reference manual, which claims in <a href=\"https://leanprover.github.io/reference/lexical_structure.html#symbols-and-commands\">section 2.1</a> that the built-in commands are listed in section 5 but I can't find the list, unless the list is basically \"everything which appears in section 5\". I've figured out that <code>#print</code> is a command but right now <code>inductive</code> might be a keyword-like symbol which is not a command as far as I can make out.</p>",
