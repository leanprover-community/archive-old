Mathzoo is organized as a collection of \"gems\" that are both standalone (a short file that depends only on mathlib) and deadend (nothing will ever depend on it). The two main goals of the project are to be fun for students (&amp; others) all over the world and to support AI research in mathematical problem solving.</p>\n<p>To get started, we seeded mathzoo with the <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/master/archive/imo\">IMO problems in mathlib</a> and with all of <a href=\"https://github.com/openai/miniF2F\">miniF2F</a>. Please submit your favorite gems and spread the word.</p>",
