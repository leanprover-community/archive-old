I'm currently running some experiments in this direction with initial funding graciously provided by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"252300\">@Jalex Stark</span>.</p>\n<p>To determine what sort of build server we'd want, a key factor is how mathlib scales with additional cores. I'm currently running benchmarks on a dedicated server with 8 cores and a virtual server with 16 cores. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110087\">@Scott Morrison</span>, could you perhaps run the same benchmark on your machine?

Essentially: Anyone can make a PR that changes the GH actions workflow file, then this <em>new</em> file is run (because it can say, 'run me on a self-hosted runner when a PR is created'), and the runner does no sandboxing whatsoever. I was able to create a PR (as a random user with no affiliation with the repo) that changed the workflow file to <code>cat /etc/passwd</code> and this was executed and displayed without a hitch.

Essentially: Anyone can make a PR that changes the GH actions workflow file, then this <em>new</em> file is run (because it can say, 'run me on a self-hosted runner when a PR is created'), and the runner does no sandboxing whatsoever. I was able to create a PR (as a random user with no affiliation with the repo) that changed the workflow file to <code>cat /etc/passwd</code> and this was executed and displayed without a hitch. Whoever thought this was a remotely sensible design deserves to be slapped.</p>\n<p>What this means for the project is that I need to figure out whether I can sandbox the runner myself in a VM or something. Fun times...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's why I think we should go for a Hydra (Nix/NixOS) model</p>",

I was under the impression that people were unhappy with this and would be happier if it took significantly less long. However, if there's no demand for this project, I'll gladly drop it; the compile times don't bother me personally much (because my machine will likely remain faster than CI).</p>\n<p>In addition, if it takes 2 hours now, it might slowly getting longer and longer.<br>\nFaster feedback is nice, but also makes it future-proof.</p>",
