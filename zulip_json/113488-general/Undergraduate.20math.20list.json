It would be a very convenient first approximation, and we could modify it of course. I translated the first section (groups) and formatted it into the yaml file below. Turning that file into a webpage that looks like the mathlib overview but with links and separating missing stuff is a trivial programming exercise. My questions are: should I keep translating this list? Will there be people helping me by filling in links that I missed and editing the YaML file?</p>",

A filter on a set U is a way of defining what it means for a subset of U to be \"large and not small\" in whatever sense you need \"large\" to mean, satisfying by definition certain \"large\" properties. Namely: U is itself large; a superset of a large set is large; and if you intersect two large sets then you still have a large set (that is what I meant by \"not small\"). It turns out to be possible to define analysis using filters on the naturals; this is closely linked to Robinson's rather lovely formulation of nonstandard analysis, but it's all very much not how you're initially taught to think about analysis, so don't expect the path to understanding to be quick. I had a quick skim of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.5740.pdf\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.5740.pdf</a> and it seemed reasonable</p>",
