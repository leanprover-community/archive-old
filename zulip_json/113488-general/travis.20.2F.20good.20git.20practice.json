        "content": "<p>I am trying to use all this git/github/community mathlib infrastructure maturely now.</p>\n<p>I am in the middle of writing the proof of Hilbert basis, in a branch in my local clone of community mathlib. I've not got very far because I was distracted by (a) not having interface for coefficients of polynomials and (b) the zero ring being a constant special case. In both cases I created new branches (from master, not from my Hilbert basis branch) with small edits to files, and PR'ed directly to mathlib. My Hilbert basis branch is now pushed to community mathlib as a WIP. It depends on both these branches above -- is that a problem? I'm assuming that the system is sufficiently mature to make it not so (I am hoping I can rebase from master if and when these easy PR's are accepted). </p>\n<p>I also got involved in a different project -- adding matrices over a general ring -- and made yet another branch for these. I PR'ed this to mathlib too and then Sean almost completely rewrote it (which is great, this is exactly what community mathlib is for) and I see that the PR automatically gets updated. I am hoping that I've just about got these things right now. Scott pointed out that using <code>git merge</code> can cause chaos with history (as indeed it did with a previous zerology branch I'd created, which I've now deleted) and hopefully I've managed to use rebase correctly to make history look reasonable in all these cases. I occasionally update mathlib from upstream and rebase. If anyone has any comments on anything I'm still doing wrong with this set-up I'd be happy to hear them.</p>\n<p>As for travis -- apparently it has failed on the matrix PR :-( I can't see why. Is the fault of travis? There were github problems yesterday apparently.</p>\n<p>It's this one: <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/334\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/334\">https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/334</a></p>",
