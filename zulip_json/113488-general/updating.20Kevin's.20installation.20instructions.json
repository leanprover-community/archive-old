I think that the only cmd.exe related problem is probably resolved by Reid Barton's recent fix to leanpkg.bat.  However, there are other issues caused by passing unescaped strings to CreateProcess() in src/library/process.cpp via exec_cmd and io.proc.spawn, and by using external processes to make or detect directories instead of calling CreateDirectory() and PathFileExists().  That is surely not the recommended approach even in POSIX systems.  If I had an appropriate build environment then I would attempt to fix this myself, but I do not know how hard it would be to set that up.</p>",
