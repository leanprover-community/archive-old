I am revisiting an old file (on smooth functions between smooth manifolds, with normed spaces and smooth functions and a bunch of complicated stuff). In this file, written a few months ago, there was a line <code>set_option class.instance_max_depth 150</code> (and this was really needed, 100 was not enough since earlier in the file it was set to 100 and I had to increase it). It turns out that this line can now be removed and, even better, setting the max depth to 10 works fine! (9 is not enough, though :-)</p>",
