The idea is that it will be a tool for applying \"backwards reasoning\" (i.e. applying lemmas against the goal).</p>\n<p>The idea is that we'll tag certain lemmas with an attribute, perhaps <code>back</code>, that are \"safe\" for backwards reasoning. A good example would be <code>min_fac_dvd : ∀ (n : ℕ), min_fac n ∣ n</code>. If you can unify that conclusion with the goal, you can't possibly be unhappy --- the only parameters are determined by unification, so no new goals can appear.</p>\n<p><code>backwards_reasoning [x, y, z]</code>, will apply all lemmas marked with <code>@[back]</code> against the goal, as well as applying x, y, z. It will then apply <code>solve_by_elim</code> afterwards (so also applying all hypotheses). The key difference from just using <code>solve_by_elim</code> is that <code>backwards_reasoning</code> will succeed even if it doesn't close the goal, as long as it manages to apply at least one of the specified lemmas.</p>\n<p>Here's an example of it in action:</p>",
