Again, here I'd like to understand better what's going on in the current state of the extension, but I believe the infoview on the guest's computer is working with a \"copy\" of the edited file in the Lean server launched on their side. This Lean server seems to not be picking up any <code>leanpkg.path</code>, so it's probably defaulting to the global one. </p>\n<p>If that's the case, then my thought was that we could pop up a prompt for guests to specify a path to a Lean project on their computer to give to their Lean server. We could use <code>leanproject</code> to allow guests just to specify a github link too.</p>\n<p>Lots of ifs and open questions here, but those were my thoughts. If anyone wants to do testing along these lines, that'd be greatly appreciated.
