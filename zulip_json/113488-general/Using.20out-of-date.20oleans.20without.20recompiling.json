If you're working on a file at the beginning of mathlib, and have another file with <code>import all</code> open, then typically this will cause lots of recompilation.  However if you pass the <code>--old</code> flag to lean, it will use the out-of-date oleans for the files you haven't touched.  (This is in settings &gt; Lean: Extra Options)</p>",
