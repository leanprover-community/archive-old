I thought I fixed all the hiccups that happen when the latest released Lean and the latest released mathlib are out of sync, but it looks like something went wrong because mathlib's 3.9.0 upgrade occurred while the daily web editor build was happening. I'll rerun the job now (should finish in 3 hours or so) and in the meantime I'll see if I can make this more robust.</p>",
