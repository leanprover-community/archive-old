        "content": "<p>The motivation is to extract equivalences between two propositions from a TFAE (<a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/list.tfae\">docs#list.tfae</a>) statement  without writing down the two propositions, <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/17983#discussion_r1055134666\">see GitHub</a>. Since using <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/list.tfae.out\">docs#list.tfae.out</a> with two numbers isn't very readable, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"310045\">@Eric Wieser</span> thinks we should give names to some of the equivalences, so when they are used in other proofs we can see what's going on. This is somewhat similar to extracting the two directions from an <code>iff</code> statement using <code>alias</code>. I've also tried <code>local attribute [-linter] linter.def_lemma</code> but Lean says \"cannot remove attribute [linter]\" (why?), and that's definitely not an ideal solution. The viable solutions are the followings, AFAIK:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>implement a <a href=\"#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/tfae.20formatting/near/184350235\">proposal</a> to improve TFAE readability (see also <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/3532\">#3532</a>);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>implement another command like <code>alias</code> to extract from TFAE, or extend the syntax of <code>alias</code>;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>manually extract lemmas: currently too cumbersome. Need to change the behavior of <code>lemma</code>/<code>theorem</code> declarations to work without type ascription.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
