I don't really understand how this is possible; for now I'm working around it by setting an instance priority. But, I am pretty sure that <code>fun_setoid</code> (in <code>init/funext.lean</code>) should not be a global instance, just an instance for the scope of the proof of <code>funext</code>. Maybe that can be changed in 3.5.0?</p>",
