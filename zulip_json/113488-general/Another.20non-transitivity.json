Subsingleton elimination is something slightly different: usually, inductive data types in Prop only allow you to eliminate into Prop.  For example, the recursor for ∃ only allows you to obtain propositions, if you could eliminate into Type, then you could extract the witness and thereby prove choice.  Subsingleton elimination is now a relaxation of this restriction: in some cases it is perfectly sound for the recursor of an inductive proposition to eliminate into Type: intuitively, if you don't get any additional \"data\" when eliminating (such as constructor arguments that are in Type, or which constructor of the inductive proposition is used).  For example, ∧, false, true, all eliminate into Type.</p>",
