I could look at <code>widget</code> boundaries returned by <code>info</code>, but each widget only includes a  starting position, not a span.  I guess I could dump the contents of the relevant <code>info_manager</code> on the C++ side, but I'm not sure whether there might be a simpler solution.</p>",

The main source here is a <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/sphere-eversion/tree/master/blueprint/src\">TeX document</a> having a couple of TeX macros referencing Lean declarations (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/sphere-eversion/blob/master/blueprint/src/loops.tex#L26-L27\">example</a>).

But right now the Lean links simply send you to the relevant line on GitHub where things are completely static. plaxTeX also generates the <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/sphere-eversion/blueprint/dep_graph.html\">dependency graph/progress report</a> but this is a somewhat orthogonal story. Of course I dream of a better integration, although there will never be a one to one correspondence between informal lemmas and the formalization.</p>",

It is currently the only way to fully record Lean 3 tactic proofs, doing both (1) and (2) .  While for that project, we only need the goal and the corresponding tactic, we actually capture a lot more.  We capture the entire tree (sort of an AST) of the tactic proof, taking into account nested tactics.  We also capture position information (begin and end) as well as the tactic parameters.  <em>To be clear, I'm not suggesting you build Alectryon on top of <code>lean_proof_recording</code>.</em>  The latter is much too hacky.  However, it may be helpful for comparison of results and for making mockups of Alectryon for Lean.  It could also be helpful for finding interesting edge cases.  Also, if you can get your proof recording changes into Lean, I might consider rebuilding <code>lean_proof_recording</code> to use those instead of the current Rube Goldberg machine that is <code>lean_proof_recording</code>.</p>",

Thanks so much for taking the time to share these thoughts, it will help a whole lot ^^  Some brief answers below.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As for the boundaries, do you know if it is easy to get the end position out of the Lean C++ parser?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No, I think that info is not does no exist. For symbols it's OK (we can use word boundaries), and for tactics that's where we want to hook into the parser, so we can raise some sort of begin/end events every time we start/end to parse a tactic.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As for the internal tables, are you referring to the tables used by the language server?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was thinking of the <code>m_line_data</code> of the <code>info_manager</code>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here is a discussion of the different types of Lean tactics you will encounter. (I'm not as familiar with Coq, so I don't know how many are their as well.) […]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thanks, that's super helpful. Coq has all the facilities you listed, I think, though they are used a bit differently because of Coq's hard-baked notion of \"sentence\" (basically, one meaningful proof step, implemented as one or multiple tactics). </p>\n<p>One basic design decision in Alectryon has been to assume that any goal that's not readily accessible from an IDE isn't super important, so e.g. for repeat we only show the final goal, not any of the intermediate ones.  Same for a <code>;</code>-sequence, where we show the end result but not the evolution of the goals through the pipeline.  It's common in Coq to actually structure proofs in this way, with interesting intermediate states at the end of sentences (<code>.</code>-separated in Coq).  So for example in Coq you would do <code>induction x; simpl; intros; eauto.</code> and Alectryon will only show the goals that were not solved by eauto, with the assumption that the others were not interesting.  But if you care to show all the goals, then you could write <code>induction x; simpl; intros. all: eauto.</code> and then Alectryon will show all goals after <code>intros</code> and then only the remaining ones after <code>eauto</code>.</p>",
