This is nice for a) discovering the feature (I always used f12!), b) knowing what things go-to-definition will work on and won't.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On Windows, <code>{!!}</code> â†’ <code>ctrl</code> + <code>.</code>'s menu has wrap-around scrolling, which is very nice as some of the most-used options are at the bottom (structure creation and such like); meanwhile, in OSX, it refuses to wrap-around at the top.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I wonder which of these are intentional, so that I could either report them to the right places (I assume VSCode) / fixed in the extension itself (I'm happy to help out with this)</p>",
