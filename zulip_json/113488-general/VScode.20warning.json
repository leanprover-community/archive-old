I used to believe that assuming a sane python environment (or a sane way to create one) was a not a big requirement. But experience proves I'm wrong. There are too many users of user-hostile operating systems like Windows or MacOS. Maybe we should also be documenting a lighter way to get started, that only involves getting a precompiled Lean + one precompiled mathlib inside <code>~/.lean</code>.</p>",
