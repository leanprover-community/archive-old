In general, the idea is that when we want very different parts of the library to interact, we use a defined interface so that changes on one side have limited breakage on the other. Theorems that ignore this and unfold lots of stuff tend to be brittle to refactoring, in addition to being more complicated for lean and for humans.</p>",
