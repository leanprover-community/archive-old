This lib knew nothing about Lean so I quickly hacked a <a href=\"https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/blob/223377f4628ec4d54171bcce17b093cf518380c9/src/languages/lean.js\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/blob/223377f4628ec4d54171bcce17b093cf518380c9/src/languages/lean.js\">syntax file</a> and opened a PR. But highlightjs had no maintainer at that time, and that PR fell into a black-hole. Two days ago I <a href=\"https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/pull/1689#issuecomment-568644727\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/pull/1689#issuecomment-568644727\">was asked</a> to create a third party repository hosting that syntax file. The community no longer needs Gitter, and we couldn't even find enough energy to fix the pygments issue in Zulip (all those red rectangles we see in code blocks). But it's still nice to have more online syntax highlighting options. So I'm tempted to answer we could host that Lean highlightjs module on our leanprover-community organization. It looks like I would need to spend an hour setting things, but then it wouldn't need more time unless people start sending bug reports. What do you think?</p>",

We need to decide whether it should be hosted by the highlightjs organization or by leanprover-community. A tiny advantage of highlightjs is that it would be more visible to people wanting to make a custom build of highlightjs including all third-party languages. Otherwise self-hosting probably makes more sense.</p>",
