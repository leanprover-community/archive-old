But in the Coq community there seems to be a common belief that classes are inefficient, which is true up to some extent, since synthesizing an instance requires a whole Prolog-like backtracking search. Also one of the first big <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-14052-5_35\">class-based algebraic hierarchies for Coq</a> was basically totally unbundled, which can really blow up the sizes of terms, and furthermore Coq seems to do a bit worse when terms become really big. Canonical structures are hard to get right by hand, so the mathcomp community designed a metaprogram <a href=\"https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02478907v4/document\">Hierarchy Builder</a> to do it for them. Especially since the metaprogram is written in a dialect of Prolog, this feels like Greenspun's 10th rule but for typeclasses instead of Lisp :)</p>",
