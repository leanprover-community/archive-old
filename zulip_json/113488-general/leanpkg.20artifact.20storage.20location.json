Does anyone know of a particular reason why leanpkg copies dependencies into a \"_target\" directory in the project folder, as opposed to keeping a directory of artifacts in your home directory (e.g. like maven does)? It'd certainly avoid unnecessarily compiling mathlib multiple times when playing around with little projects.</p>",

I'm running something with UGs where we're all using mathlib 3.4.1 because trying to get 25 people to upgrade their mathlibs is a pain when some of them can't even open a terminal. I'm also doing a project which uses bleeding edge mathlib. But if I could have two flavours of mathlib installed globally I'd be happier than I am now, because I often find myself recompiling. I sometimes cheat and copy and paste instead of recompiling.</p>",
