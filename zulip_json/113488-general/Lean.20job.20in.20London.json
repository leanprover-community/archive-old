The position is funded by Imperial College’s Excellence Fund for Frontier Research and will involve teaching various aspects of modern research arithmetic geometry to the Lean Theorem Prover.</p>\n<p>Duties and Responsibilities</p>\n<p>The project will involve working closely with Professor Kevin Buzzard and the number theory group at Imperial College, and will involve formalising some of the ideas in one or more of the following topics: de Jong’s Stacks Project, the theory of etale cohomology, the Langlands Program (and in particular formalisations of the statements of the main theorems and conjectures), class field theory and arithmetic duality, Scholze’s theory of perfectoid spaces, Lurie’s theory of infinity categories, the Clausen/Scholze theory of condensed sets.</p>\n<p>Essential Requirements</p>\n<p>The essential requirements for this post are as follow:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>• A PhD or equivalent level of professional qualifications and/or experience in either algebraic number theory or formal proof verification.\n• Knowledge of, or evidence that you can quickly learn about, some of the basic tools of modern algebraic number theory.\n• Knowledge of, or evidence that you can quickly learn about, formalising pure mathematics in the Lean Theorem Prover.\n• Ability to carry out original research and to produce published research papers.\n• Ability to identify, develop and apply new concepts, techniques and methods.\n• Ability to organise and prioritise own work with minimal supervision.\n• Ability to prioritise own work in response to deadlines.\n• Ability to communicate complex information clearly\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<hr>\n<p>When it's actually in some published form I'll circulate it in the normal way, but I thought I should flag that this is, hopefully, coming soon.
