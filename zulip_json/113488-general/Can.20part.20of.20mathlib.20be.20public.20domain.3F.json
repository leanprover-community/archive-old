If you mean legally, I have no idea, because to me copyright is nonsense and I live in a country which doesn't recognize any copyright laws, so I can't answer that. The point of having the Unlicense is to say \"I don't care about copyright\". So, whoever wants to respect the author (by saying \"he wrote this piece of code\"), they should also respect the author's decision by saying \"and he doesn't care about copyright\" by allowing the piece of code to be in the public domain.</p>\n<p>BTW, here is the example: <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/pull/1295/files\">https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/pull/1295/files</a></p>",
