Ideally, when a computation is requested from Lean for a GCD, the result as well as a GCD algorithm proof is returned. Lean can then verify that the proof is valid. But it is computationally more efficient if both Axiom and Lean use a cryptographic hash, such as SHA1. That way the proof doesn't need to be 'reproven', only the hash computation over the proof text needs to be performed. Hashes are blazingly fast. This allows proofs to be exchanged without the need to re-run the proof mechanism. Since a large computation request from Lean might involve many algorithms there would be considerable overhead to recompute each proof. A hash simplifies the issue yet provides proof integrity.</p>",

Renaming a function is a 1-line change in the metadata, and doesn't break any code. You no longer store your code in files, but in this content addressable store managed by Unison. If you want to read the definition of a function, the system renders a textual representation for you, based on the content of some hashes + the names in the metadata. So you don't actually see the hashes.<br>\nIt should make things like distributed code, reproducibility, refactoring code, etc... easier.</p>",

There is a SHA3 with a different design  but like Linux, I don't see the concern) What you want is a hash that depends on EVERY bit of the file contents. </p>\n<p>I am looking at the Unison website now. Perhaps Lean could construct itself on Unison and let someone else do the heavy lifting of crafting a hash-based solution. Either way, if you're going from 3 mathematicians to 3000 mathematicians, a couple dozen computer algebra systems, a large corpus of proven algorithms, and a non-trivial pile of mathematics, all hiding somewhere \"in the cloud\", it helps to have a scalable design.</p>\n<p>With trusted algorithms, Axiom could use some other system's algorithms for, say, algebraic geometry without re-implementing them. I'm not inventing these ideas. There are whole conferences and funded research efforts on the subject. (See James Davenport for some connections). Systems need trusted communication designed in.</p>\n<p>There is also work on organizing the theorems. Axiom uses a hierarchy so they can be inherited based on properties (e.g. a chain of axioms that assume commutativity (giving arithmetic) verses a different chain that does not assume that (e.g. matrices). See the work of Farmer and Carette on \"tiny theories\". This scales much better than a flat organization.</p>\n<p>Oh, and don't get me started on the (literate) documentation :-)</p>",
