Am I right in thinking that the original hammer was sledgehammer, which is something to do with Paulson and/or <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"121058\">@Jasmin Blanchette</span> ? Is there something explicit I can cite? This is 2010, right? I googled around but keep finding instruction manuals. Is there a publication for \"Hammer for Coq\"? I can't find anything other than preprints. Are there hammers for other systems? I know about <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110043\">@Gabriel Ebner</span> 's work in Lean (and I am assuming there is also nothing to cite here). By a hammer I think I mean an interface which enables an ITP to talk to an ATP. Would it be right to claim that hammers are currently any kind of \"hot topic\" or \"active area of study\"? Or is the basic idea completely understood and the only issue is what parameters and lemmas one should pass to the ATP? Is the latter question a boring one, basically understood, or something which one could envisage AI having a say in?</p>",
