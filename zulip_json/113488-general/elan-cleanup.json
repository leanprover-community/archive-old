It detects used toolchains by looking for <code>lean-toolchain</code> files below your home directory (excluding directories starting with <code>.</code>), then deletes any toolchain not mentioned in a <code>lean-toolchain</code> file.</p>\n<p>At the moment there are very few bells and whistles (e.g. you can't customise where it looks for <code>lean-toolchain</code> files), but maybe someone finds it useful nonetheless.</p>",
