Say I wanted to make an AI that could convert informal English-math into Lean statements.  What is the closest related project to this, that you know of?</p>\n<p>For example \"Let $G$ be a group.\" would convert to a code listing that does all the necessary imports at the start, and defines a symbol - should just be ascii G itself - to be of type group.  But it's not simply just converting each paragraph and concatenating the results, there's probably a lot of orchestrating that needs to be done so that the end Lean code is valid.</p>",
