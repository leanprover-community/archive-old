As it is part this year of the Federated Logic Conference, it will take place in parallel with other even larger events, and people will possibly spend time rushing between the parallel sessions of a rather dense agenda... Usually, only a fraction of these talks are about formalized maths (as opposed for instance to program verification in general). But I have high expectations for Dan Grayson's invited talk. He will deliver a talk in memoriam of Vladimir Voevodsky but we hope that he will also speak about his own opinion about formalizing mathematics.</p>",
