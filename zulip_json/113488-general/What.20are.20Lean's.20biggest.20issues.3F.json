The general strategy is just to do a tree search applying lemmas from the library against the active goal, but working more generally than either <code>solve_by_elim</code> (which just does depth first, on a specified set of lemmas) or <code>library_search</code>, which does a single step from the entire library, followed by <code>solve_by_elim</code> with local hypotheses. For <code>back</code>, I maintain a priority queue of different branches of the search, and try to get the priority function right. Heuristics like \"anytime you get to use a local hypothesis is good\" and \"more subgoals is worse than less\" and \"goals that depend on other goals via metavariables are bad\" get you some of the way. Idiotic heuristics like \"use lemmas with short names instead of long names\" are surprisingly helpful.)</p>",

It seems clear to me that abstracting from tedious details is extremely important for any sort of mainstream adoption, but I don't yet have any good idea of how to advance that goal.</p>\n<p>Actually, let me run an idea by you all. It's like half an hour old, so no details, but the gist is to make automation interactive. Currently, all these search procedures are essentially black boxes: you call them and they either succeed or fail; if they fail you have to figure out, usually without any help, what lemmas or proof steps were missing. There are also often performance concerns where the heuristic picks the wrong branch of a search tree and ends up wasting an eternity on an unprovable goal. These concerns, and maybe more, could be alleviated by just asking the user:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"I've spent N ms on this goal without being able to solve it. Do you think it should be provable?\"</li>\n<li>\"I could apply this lemma to solve the goal if this precondition was true, but I can't prove it. Is it true?\"</li>\n<li>\"Applying this technique is risky because it may blow up the search space. Would you like me to try anyway?\"</li>\n<li>\"I could make progress by breaking through some abstraction barrier. Is that a good idea?\"</li>\n<li>\"There are different possible solutions for this typeclass instance. Which one should I choose?\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Obviously, there are a lot of technical questions here, but does this sound like something worth trying?</p>",

        "content": "<p>I agree. One of the things I like about Isabelle's <code>auto</code> is that you can use it sort-of interactively. You try it, look at the mess it leaves, and then say, \"oh, it just needs this <code>simp</code> lemma\" or \"it just needs this fact.\" That doesn't always work: sometimes, it does some unpacking and then doesn't know how to instantiate some quantifier, and then there is no way to specify that from the start. (\"When you get to the part when you have introduced an arbitrary <code>epsilon</code> and want to use the continuity hypothesis, use <code>epsilon / 2</code>.\") It would be great to find ways of conveying that information. Typically the user has a general idea why the inference is true, and will be happy to provide additional guidance.</p>\n<p>By the way, my understanding is that stuff like this is one of the motivations for turning syntax into first-class objects in Lean 4. Imagine what we could do if the simplifier returned a trace as a structured object that a tactic could traverse. You could use a GUI to navigate the tree and figure out where it is going wrong, and then add an annotation to steer it in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Another thought: it is generally easier for users (especially mathematicians) to give terms and statements rather than theorem names. We want to say \"at some point, use <code>p &gt; 0</code>\" rather than \"at some point, use <code>nat.prime_pos</code>.\" We want to think about the mathematically relevant stuff, not the names of theorems or the way they are expressed in the library.</p>",
