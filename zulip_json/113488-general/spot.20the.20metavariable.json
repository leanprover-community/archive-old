In contrast to most <code>blah.rec</code> recursors, which have type <code> Π {C : blah -&gt; Sort u},...</code>, <code>false.rec</code> has type <code> Π (C : Sort u_1), false → C </code>, so whilst in general I can see the issue and why that generic error shows up, for <code>false.rec</code> the information is there. I guess what I am saying is that perhaps the definition <code>false.rec</code> seems to have been explicitly manipulated by the system so that the motive is not implicit, but the error seems to indicate that some generic rule for recursors has been applied without noticing that in this case it does not apply. I have given Lean all the information it needs to work out the expected type and it has chosen to ignore it because I didn't put the <code>@</code>.
