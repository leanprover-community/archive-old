But it's also going to be online if you don't want to travel, registration is free. <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span> Submission deadline is December 4th.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>The Thirteenth NASA Formal Methods Symposium</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/nfm2021/\">https://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/nfm2021/</a><br>\n               24-28 May 2021<br>\n              Norfolk, VA, USA</p>\n<p>The symposium will be held in an in-person/virtual hybrid format in<br>\nNorfolk, VA, USA, possibly transitioning to fully virtual depending on<br>\nthe COVID-19 situation.</p>\n<p><em>Theme of the Symposium:</em><br>\nThe widespread use and increasing complexity of mission-critical and<br>\nsafety-critical systems at NASA and in the aerospace industry require<br>\nadvanced techniques that address these systems' specification, design,<br>\nverification, validation, and certification requirements.  The NASA<br>\nFormal Methods Symposium (NFM) is a forum to foster collaboration<br>\nbetween theoreticians and practitioners from NASA, academia, and<br>\nindustry. NFM's goals are to identify challenges and to provide<br>\nsolutions for achieving assurance for such critical systems.  New<br>\ndevelopments and emerging applications like autonomous software for<br>\nUnmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), UAS Traffic Management (UTM), advanced<br>\nseparation assurance algorithms for aircraft, and the need for<br>\nsystem-wide fault detection, diagnosis, and prognostics provide new<br>\nchallenges for system specification, development, and verification<br>\napproaches. Similar challenges need to be addressed during development<br>\nand deployment of on-board software for both spacecraft and ground<br>\nsystems.  The focus of the symposium will be on formal techniques and<br>\nother approaches for software assurance, including their theory,<br>\ncurrent capabilities and limitations, as well as their potential<br>\napplication to aerospace, robotics, and other NASA-relevant<br>\nsafety-critical systems during all stages of the software life-cycle.</p>\n<p>The NASA Formal Methods Symposium is an annual event organized by the<br>\nNASA Formal Methods (NFM) Research Group, comprised of researchers<br>\nspanning six NASA centers. NFM2021 is being organized by the NASA<br>\nLangley Formal Methods Team.</p>\n<p><em>Topics of Interest:</em><br>\nWe encourage submissions on cross-cutting approaches that bring<br>\ntogether formal methods and techniques from other domains such as<br>\nprobabilistic reasoning, machine learning, control theory, robotics,<br>\nand quantum computing among others.  Topics of interest include, but<br>\nare not limited to, the following aspects of formal methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advances in formal methods:</li>\n<li>Formal verification, model checking, and static analysis techniques</li>\n<li>\n<p>Theorem proving: advances in interactive and automated theorem<br>\n    proving (SAT, SMT, etc.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Program and specification synthesis, code transformation and generation</p>\n</li>\n<li>Run-time verification</li>\n<li>Techniques and algorithms for scaling formal methods</li>\n<li>Test case generation</li>\n<li>Design for verification and correct-by-design techniques</li>\n<li>\n<p>Requirements generation, specification, and validation</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Integration of formal methods techniques:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Use of machine learning techniques in formal methods</li>\n<li>Integration of formal methods into software engineering practices </li>\n<li>Integration of diverse formal methods techniques</li>\n<li>\n<p>Combination of formal methods with simulation and analysis techniques</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Formal methods in practice:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Experience report of application of formal methods in industry</li>\n<li>Use of formal methods in education</li>\n<li>Verification of machine learning techniques</li>\n<li>Applications of formal methods in the development of:<br>\n     - autonomous systems,<br>\n     - safety-critical systems,<br>\n     - concurrent and distributed systems,<br>\n     - cyber-physical, embedded, and hybrid systems<br>\n     - fault-detection, diagnostics, and prognostics systems<br>\n     - human-machine interaction analysis</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Important Dates:</em><br>\nAbstract Submission: 27 November 2020<br>\nPaper Submission: 4 December 2020<br>\nPaper Notifications: 19 February 2021<br>\nCamera-ready Papers: 19 March 2021<br>\nSymposium: 24-28 May 2021</p>\n<p><em>Submission Details:</em><br>\nThere are two categories of submissions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Regular papers describing fully developed work and complete results<br>\n   (maximum 15 pages);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Short papers on tools, experience reports, or work in progress with<br>\n   preliminary results (maximum 6 pages).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The submitted papers should not exceed 15 pages for regular papers and<br>\n6 pages for short papers, including tables and figures, but excluding<br>\nbibliography and clearly marked appendices.

In addition to appendices, authors are encouraged to<br>\nmake available any other supplementary material supporting the claims<br>\nmade in the paper, such as proof scripts or experimental data, as the<br>\navailability and reproducibility of these artifacts may be considered<br>\nby reviewers in scoring.
