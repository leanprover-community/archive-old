I don't want to start a flame war, but I just want to address @ppedrot's concern about quotients causing a failure of subject reduction.</p>\n<p>The reason that quotients cause a failure of subject reduction is a historical design issue with quotients, and not anything that comes up in practice. The problem is the interaction between quotients and definitional proof irrelevance (which Lean has for its bottom universe <code>Prop</code>). The problem is that quotients can be defined for types in all universes, even for propositions. In this case, we can get a failure of subject reduction (described <a href=\"https://github.com/digama0/lean-type-theory/releases/download/v1.0/main.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/digama0/lean-type-theory/releases/download/v1.0/main.pdf\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>Note that taking a quotient of a proposition is a useless operation, because all propositions are already subsingletons. We only take quotients of types that are not in <code>Prop</code> in practice, and the problem doesn't occur there.</p>\n<p>Ideally, we would remove the ability to take quotients of propositions from Lean. This would remove this failure of subject reduction (there is still another failure with inductive families of propositions + proof irrelevance) and would not decrease the usability of quotients.</p>\n</blockquote>",
