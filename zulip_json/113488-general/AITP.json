A lot of the slides for the talks are now available online. I was permanently confused by the people who were producing data of the following form: \"We took a dataset of lots of theorems, trained our AI on 70% of them and then saw how it did on the rest; it solved 56% of them\". And I would say \"yeah but which ones? Did it solve any hard ones? Did it solve precisely all the ones which had two line proofs? What about all the theorems in the test data which were trivial corollaries of the stuff in the training data? Which statements did your deep learning neural net or whatever it is actually _solve_?\" but they didn't think that way -- for them the theorems are just a database. I don't think they have favourite theorems :-) </p>\n<p>Some people from google were writing a system-agnostic theorem prover; one of them told me that computers would be better than humans at maths within 10 years. Not everyone believed this. But the argument for it is apparently \"look at computer vision -- everyone said it was completely impossible 20 years ago but now we have self-driving cars\".</p>",
