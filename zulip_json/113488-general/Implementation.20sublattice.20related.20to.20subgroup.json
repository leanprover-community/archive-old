I have noticed in subgroups that they are not built on groups but on monoid. Why is it better to build definition of subgroup on monoid rather than group. Should I code sublattice definition based on semilattice_sup and semilattice_inf rather than lattice?</p>",

At the end I would like to contribute to mathlib so if there's no reason not to build sublattice on lattice I can do it that way.</p>",
