Recently, I noticed that in <code>field_theory/is_alg_closed/basic</code> (which will be an import of <code>algebra/algebra/spectrum</code> after <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10783\">#10783</a> merges), there is a proof that every element of a finite dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed field has nonempty spectrum. This is used in two places in mathlib: <code>category_theory/preadditive/schur</code> and <code>linear_algebra/eigenspace</code>. Does anyone object to my moving this theorem into the spectrum file and updating the references accordingly? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110087\">@Scott Morrison</span> I'm asking you specifically since <code>git blame</code> tells me you added this in its current form.</p>",
