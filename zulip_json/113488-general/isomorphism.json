Note that the inbuilt basis stuff in Lean is not ordered, so you need the notion of an ordered basis, which I think you have. </p>\n<p>What you should then maybe do is: (1) for a fixed vector space V and natural number n, define a type of \"bases for V of size n\" and define a type of \"isomorphisms k^n -&gt; V\". Then write down maps in both directions and prove that the composites are the identity in both directions. Keji was doing something similar the other day (but not the same -- he was looking at matrices = linear maps, you're doing something else). </p>\n<p>I think first I would prove that for V and n, there's a bijection between k-linear maps k^n -&gt; V and lists of elements of V of length n.</p>\n<p>I have some minor hold-ups at home but I hope to be at work for 11:30 -- are you in today Blair? We could talk more then.</p>",
