        "content": "<p>Over the weekend, all of the PC's in the computer room where we do Xena got upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 (the hardware didn't change, but they are decent machines). One of the things I did yesterday (when I was ignoring chat) was to get bleeding edge Lean and make a basic repository with a toml and path file and one .lean file with a proof that 2+2=4, add mathlib as a dependency, make all the .olean files and then zip the whole lot up at <a href=\"http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/Xena.zip\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/Xena.zip\">http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/Xena.zip</a> . </p>\n<p>Why do this? Because now here are my instructions for students wanting to use Lean (which is not installed by default) on our departmental PC's. Note that VS Code _is_ installed. </p>\n<p>1) Download Xena.zip, put on your desktop, unpack.<br>\n2) Fire up VS Code, File-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Settings, fix path to lean executable<br>\n3) Open default project folder (something like Xena/my_project, I forget)<br>\n4) Done.</p>\n<p>Note: no mention of git and <em>no mention of a terminal</em>, mathlib imports work out the box, and start-up time was no more than a few seconds on these machines. Music to the basic Windows-users ears! The .olean files <em>seemed</em> to be portable from machine to machine (all machines have pretty much exactly the same build, and are reset every night somehow -- all user interference is wiped and they become canonically isomorphic machines from the point of view of local disc content). </p>\n<p>I would be interested to hear anyone else's experience with using this zip file on a Windows 10 machine. Although it sounds stupid, I tried it on a linux machine without changing my version of Lean (I don't think linux can make much sense of <code>lean.exe</code>) but it didn't work at all -- all of the imports failed. I put this down to all the .olean files being unreadable, or whatever. But for this project I was only interested in Windows anyway and initial results have been positive.</p>",

I suspect it might be something to do with the olean files not being compatible across OS's but I'm not sure.</p>",
