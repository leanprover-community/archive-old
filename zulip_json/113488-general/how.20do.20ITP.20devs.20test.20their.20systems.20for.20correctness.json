The goal is to keep the kernel as small as possible which ideally makes it easier to verify. By having a small trusted kernel, developers of a theorem proving system do not have to worry about what tactics and higher level language constructs are doing to the proof object as long as it is checked by the kernel***(ideally).</p>\n<p>Since the kernel is a type checker for a type theory, you can prove metatheorems about your type theory by hand or in another proof assistant. Some type theories have large implementations like Coq and its Calculus of Inductive Constructions which make verifying the code implementation harder.  (Interestingly a large chunk of that is code for inductive types which are actually derivable within other type theories. See Calculus of Dependent Lambda Eliminations and Cedille)</p>\n<p>As for verifying the code implementing your typechecker you could use existing research and development for verifying any software. Lean4 seems to be written in C++ so something like AutoCorres could be applied to kernel code.</p>",
