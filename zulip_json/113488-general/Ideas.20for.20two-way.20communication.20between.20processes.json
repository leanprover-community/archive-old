Initially, I am just interested in using lean to drive z3 (similar to, say an F# script), later I'll look into doing more fancy stuff.</p>\n<p>Because lean doesn't have an FFI and also because it makes is very easy replace z3 with <code>[smtlib-compatible smt solver]</code>, I'm not using the z3 api, but rather am communicating with it through pipes in a child process.</p>\n<p>Lean seems to be perfectly capable dealing with parsing, AST, etc. but I'm really struggling with IO for all the wrong reasons.</p>\n<p>The SMTLib protocol is a two-way communication protocol, not something you send a script to and get a response. You send a few commands, at some point, you may send <code>(check-sat)</code>, then <code>z3</code> is meant to send you <code>sat</code>, <code>unsat</code> or <code>unknown</code>. Depending on what you got, you then have other commands you can execute and deal with. And you can issue some other commands to get back to a different state where you can use other commands again, etc. If used from a REPL, It's really fairly intuitive.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the interaction really doesn't look at all like any of the IO samples I've seen like reading a file, because it's really interactive. The most natural way for me to represent such a protocol would be a state machine where transitions happen when a message is sent or received.</p>\n<p>So far, I haven't found a good way how to implement this. I can't read after each message sent, because I don't know how much data to read and the read is blocking. In a usual language, I'd either do event-based async io, or have a thread used for writing and one for reading. Also the protocol is not line-based, so I can't use that trick either.</p>\n<p>Any ideas how to go about it, or have any of you done something similar?</p>",

(You might also want to look at what <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110043\">@Gabriel Ebner</span> did with hooking up an SMT solver to Lean.)</p>\n<p>However, I can say the following. I've been playing around with using Lean to communicate (in both directions) with python via IO for machine learning..  While your needs are probably different from mine, if you can get a two-way communication going with a Python script, then you can have the script handle the communication with Z3.  I think this is similar to what <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110596\">@Rob Lewis</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110187\">@Minchao Wu</span> did with communicating between Lean and Python (<a href=\"#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Calling.20external.20process.20in.20a.20tactic/near/198857265\">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Calling.20external.20process.20in.20a.20tactic/near/198857265</a>).</p>\n<p>As for communicating between Lean and Python, I've found two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Call Lean as a process from within a python script (and have Lean communicate with stdin, stdout)</li>\n<li>Have Lean call the Python process as a child processes.  (this is probably better for your case).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Also, in my method, you need a communication protocol.  Lean doesn't have JSON built in, but I implemented it and implemented some serializers for some of my classes.  (I also made a hacky version of JSON, since Lean's string parsing is too slow.</p>",

The problem with your line <code>s &lt;- io.fs.read child.stdout 4</code>, is that I don't have <code>4</code> and the call is blocking. I can't do a read to end as it's blocking, I can't read a buffer of, say 1024, because it blocks until it either gets that many or reaches EOF, and I can't read-line because some responses are multi-line and I'd have to parse the (partial) response to guess that there should be more data to come. </p>\n<p>Apparently how the F* repo is (or at least was, maybe they changed that in the meantime) doing this is by weaving in an <code>(echo \"Done!\")</code>after every submit they do. Then they know, that the last thing they need to read is a <code>Done!</code> message. </p>\n<p>Of all the solutions I've seen so far, this feels like the simplest and moderately clean. Because I can then use just the <code>get_line</code> function over and over, until I read my marker line, knowing that everything I read before would have been the response to the user's request. </p>\n<p>And it's safe in the sense, that even in case there is a clash with the string (I'd use a much more cryptic marker to reduce the chances of a conflict), <code>get_line</code> will still not be blocked, but at worst will not return the whole output.

I had a general purpose JSON parser which read in and parsed JSON to an inductive type <code>json</code>. (Besides the parser, I also built a serializer for the <code>json</code> type.) Then for my API, I made custom structures and inductive types.  All serialization and deserialization of the API objects went through the <code>json</code> type.  (I even wrote a python script which took a lean structure or inductive type and automatically wrote all the boilerplate to convert to/from <code>json</code>.  (I've been spoiled by Google's Protobuf format which automatically turns a protobuf API into whatever language you need, so I wanted to reproduce a little of that magic.)</p>",
