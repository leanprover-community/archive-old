If you <code>set_option pp.all true</code> and then <code>#print x</code> then you can see that <code>has_lt.lt</code> is using <code>nat.has_lt</code> and if you <code>#print nat.has_lt</code> you can see it uses <code>nat.lt</code>. If you're asking about the definition of <code>nat.lt</code> you can <code>#print nat.lt</code> and then right click on it. If you want to see what type class resolution will use then you can write...the question just disappeared.</p>",
