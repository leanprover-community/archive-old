But it is also useful to point out how Lean handles them uniformly by having expressions for both, and even lets you combine them. Finding a group by class inference is a good example -- you are relying on Lean to figure out what the operations are (the data) and also their properties (the proofs). Similarly, the subtype <code>{n // n &gt; 0}</code> is, overall, treated like a data type, but it combines both data and a proof.</p>\n<p>You can similarly compare the statements \"5 is odd,\" \"there is an odd number,\" and \"there is a unique odd number between 4 and 6.\" Mathematically, we can produce data from the latter two facts by talking about \"some odd number\" or \"<em>the</em> unique odd number between 4 and 6.\" Lean can do that too, and I wouldn't too much of a big deal about the distinction here. Both ways of talking about groups are common in the informal literature. It's just that sooner or later we have to talk about \"the inverse\" and introduce names for it, and if you were coding up a symbolic algebra package you want to provide code to compute inverses. </p>\n<p>Overall, I think it is important not to make things more confusing than they are. Talk about the different representations of groups in ordinary mathematical terms, make sure students are clear about that the differences are (and why they are mathematically irrelevant), and then talk about how you could represent them in Lean and why one way might be better than another.</p>",
