I was trying to do a formalization of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ham_sandwich_theorem\">ham sandwich theorem</a> and I couldn't figure out how to talk about having \"n n-dimensional objects\" in my theorem statement (or how to talk about slicing all of them in half with whatever volume means...)<br>\ni was thinking i would start with the pancake theorem (2-D version), in which case I would need to know how to tell Lean that I want a theorem statement saying \"If I have two two-dimensional objects (on a plane), I can draw one line that bisects the area of both objects\".<br>\npretty much all I've got right now is <code>euclidean_space ℝ (fin 2)</code> and I have no idea how to write the rest. Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br>\nthanks :)</p>",
