As far as I can see, <code>a * b * c</code> is simpler than <code>a * (b * c)</code>, so why isn't <code>mul_assoc.symm</code> a <code>simp</code> lemma, sending <code>(a * b) * c</code> to <code>a * b * c</code>, and then we could have <code>simp</code> lemmas like <code>a * b * b\\-1 = a</code> and <code>a * b\\-1 * b = a</code> and get a confluent rewriting system for groups which doesn't have a normal form with a gazillion brackets in?</p>",
