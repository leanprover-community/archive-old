        "content": "<p>Why does mathlib use typeclasses everywhere? <br>\nI'm looking at mathlib seriously for the first time and have odd feelings about the design. There's probably a whole history behind it that I can't really figure out..<br>\nIf I had to do design a math library myself, I would probably start by not using typeclasses at all. I would use only structures and functions because its so easy to think with just them.<br>\nI think typeclasses make sense in software programming contexts, where you start by modeling requirements at high level using abstract types, and you can decide later what implementation you want to plug in or out. Now it's not obvious to me why they are so useful in a proof library. I think you'd want to have a unique canonical representation for a given math concept, and some functions/theorems directly defined on it. I'm not sure why you want to abstract behavior so much.<br>\nI have the impression that the main point of typeclasses in mathlib is to make some parameters and conversions implicit in order to make the code shorter. Mathlib design seems to assume that if it's shorter to write, it must be more simple. But is it really simpler to make information implicit if it becomes a hard problem to reconstruct it?<br>\nI feel like there is too much effort in making things look extremely short often to the detriment of readability. On the one hand, tactics are really great because they automate work that's hard to do by hand, and it's usually clear what they do. On the other hand, typeclasses remove some boilerplate that would be easy to write by hand, but now it's hard to understand what instance is used where.<br>\nI might sound crazy but I think I'd prefer converting inputs and passing instances explicitly every time i call a lemma in a proof. It's really a one time job, unlike in software programming where client requirements move all the time.<br>\nWhen I glance at the chat discussions, and papers about lean, there seems to have been a lot of effort spent on performance problems with instance resolution, with unintended diamonds and cycles, with design choices about bundled definitions, about the hierarchy... Surely I can find a lot about why typeclasses are causing problems, but actually I can't find much about why having them is so great/why not having them is so bad.<br>\nNow i'm certainly inexperienced and ignorant of all the history, I'm just throwing naive random thoughts as a newcomer. Were there past attempts at designing a mathlib without typeclasses? Are there papers/historical discussions/ list of examples on the usefulness of typeclasses in proof libraries?</p>",

While it's true that if you look at the terms that lean produces using typeclass inference that it would be hell to write that yourself, this isn't really a fair comparison because in the alternate world you would have short names for the relevant transitive instances. As Patrick alluded to, Metamath does things a little bit differently, and it basically boils down to having shortcut instances for common paths and using the lemma once per proof. When proofs are long this is a reasonable option since it is a small fraction of the full proof, but it is not incompatible with a prolog like proof search for these lemmas.</p>",

This would encourage the solver to take advantage of instances that provide path compression without requiring users to explicitly assign a global priority to each instance.</p>",
