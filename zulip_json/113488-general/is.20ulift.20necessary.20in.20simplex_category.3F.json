We added the ulift to the simplex category in order to obtain (co)limits of simplicial objects in terms of (co)limits of functors. It's possible that, after <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"439483\">@Andrew Yang</span> 's change to the universes in the (co)limit library, it is now possible to remove <code>ulift</code>. On the other hand, I do think it could be worthwhile to have a universe polymorphic <code>simplex_category</code>, so we may consider either leaving the ulift there, or redefining <code>simplex_category</code> altogether with some bespoke typees.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"243562\">@Adam Topaz</span> Thanks. Indeed, if we remove the <code>ulift</code>, it seems to me that the <code>has_limits</code> and <code>has_colimits</code> instances are automatically obtained from <code>category_theory.limits.functor_category</code>. Then, would not it be better to change back <code>simplex_category</code> as equivalent to <code>ℕ</code>, and then use the general constructions you did in <code>category_theory.category.ulift</code>to ulift both objects and morphisms to a chosen universe (if this is really needed)? (Actually, it seems to me that the code in <code>simplex_category</code> kind of duplicates the code in <code>category.ulift</code>.) This would not be very high in my priority list, but I could try to do it before I PR the functoriality of the Dold-Kan equivalence (with respect to additive functors between abelian categories).</p>",
