        "content": "<p>Hi all, as an experiment I made some changes to the Lean VM sourcecode so that it can do basic floating point arithmetic in the VM. It was just an experiment so I do not have the intention of working on it for PR. Overall I found working with the C++ codebase easy to figure out so I would like to thank the Lean team for that.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/EdAyers/lean/commit/f839ef617d896d216abe4712abc7caf9d031d3a3\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/EdAyers/lean/commit/f839ef617d896d216abe4712abc7caf9d031d3a3\">https://github.com/EdAyers/lean/commit/f839ef617d896d216abe4712abc7caf9d031d3a3</a></p>\n<p>The idea is that one would eventually write a Lean file that follows IEEE floating points specification, then prove stuff about <code>float</code>s (not from scratch. Use John Harrison's work or eg: <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/IEEE_Floating_Point.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/IEEE_Floating_Point.html\">https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/IEEE_Floating_Point.html</a>) , but also these floats are backed by the VM. I guess that the Lean team already have something like this in mind, since it has clear analogies to the other proof -&gt; VM entities in Lean, perhaps for Lean 4? I know how horrific the IEEE spec for floating points is so I completely acknowledge that it a hard problem to have verified floats in Lean.</p>\n<p>I would really appreciate any feedback on whether I am using the Lean C++ correctly: in particular:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>meta instance : has_add float := ⟨add⟩</code> doesn't work because it says that it \"failed to generate bytecode for 'has_add' code generation failed, VM does not have code for 'native.float.add'\". This seems to happen because the \"does it have a VM builtin?\" check only happens if the declaration is a definition rather than a constant. What is the workaround for this? One possibility is to make it a <code>definition</code> and include a bogus definition. But that seems really dirty.</li>\n<li>I'm just stuffing the bits of the float into <code>mk_vm_simple</code> which I don't claim to understand. This also seems dirty but it worked. Is there a canonical way of doing this?</li>\n</ul>",
