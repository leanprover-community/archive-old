There is a <a href=\"https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/freedom-to-leonid-rybnikov\">petition</a> demanding the court to free him; the authors ask that only mathematicians sign it. Here a mathematician is one who can prove, e.g., <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/nat.exists_infinite_primes\">docs#nat.exists_infinite_primes</a>, so all of you qualify. I doubt that Russian courts care about petitions but Leonid will be glad to see your support once he's free again. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1968827176612189&amp;id=100004547777153\">Here</a> is a photo of him discussing math with students while waiting in line to be jailed.</p>",
