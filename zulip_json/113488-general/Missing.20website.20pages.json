The homework had a significant Lean component and most people elected to beat the NNG for their final project. There were 15 students and I found the Lean feedback overall very positive. </p>\n<p>Alas there is no outward facing material.

Of the 21 students 20 are maths student and one is from the computing department (teaching is heavily department-based in the UK; you do not \"major in X\", you come to university with \"I do X\" stamped on your forehead and then only do classes from department X; the computing person had to explicitly ask for the rules to be bent and I had to argue for them).</p>",

NNG makes an object and its API from scratch without using anything from mathlib other than tactics. The moment you want to deal with objects defined in mathlib you have to pick up some different skills. I spent the first month of my code t teaching tactics and using rcases to take terms apart and talking about definitional equality, but now in the second month I need to start teaching these people how to use library API and this is a different kind of problem to figuring out the difference between <code>apply</code> and <code>rw</code>.</p>",
