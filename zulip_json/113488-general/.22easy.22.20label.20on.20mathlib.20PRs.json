Maintainers often look at easy PRs first to keep the queue flowing. Easy PRs typically add a single lemma, correct typos in documentation, or similar. If you have any doubt whether your PR is trivial you should not add this label. In particular, a PR is generally <em>not</em> easy if the diff is more than 25 lines, it adds any definitions or new files, or it adds any <code>simp</code> lemmas or instances that are not immediately analogous to existing <code>simp</code> lemmas or instances.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Summary: please be cautious about adding this label! Only add if if you're pretty sure that we'll merge the PR within 20 seconds of looking at it.</p>",
