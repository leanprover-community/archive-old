The files in the directory above that have an associated <code>.expected.out</code> file which the test runner checks against the produced output. The interactive tests have their own format, you can put in line comments with carets in them indicating where to run server commands (e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/blob/master/tests/lean/interactive/complete_import.lean\">this file</a>) and then the server output is compared to the contents of <code>.expected.out</code> (e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/blob/master/tests/lean/interactive/complete_import.lean.expected.out\">the corresponding file</a>).</p>",
