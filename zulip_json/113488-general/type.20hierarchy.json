Is it wrong to claim that If definition of <code>(A: Type i)</code> is dependent on definition of <code>(B: Type j)</code>, then <code>i &gt; j</code> must hold? I tried it myself with example below but it actually pass the type test. Why?</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">inductive</span> <span class=\"n\">myType</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span> <span class=\"bp\">|</span> <span class=\"n\">none</span> <span class=\"bp\">|</span> <span class=\"n\">some</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">â„•</span> <span class=\"bp\">-&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">myType</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
