I think Sebastian Ullrich once told me that there was no documentation for <code>leanpkg.path</code> because this was not a file that an end user was ever supposed to mess with. I am assuming <code>builtin_path</code> points to where the core lean library is. I am assuming that there's no file with the same name in Lean and mathlib, so I guess in theory they could do the slightly horrible-sounding thing of dumping all of mathlib in the core lean directory. But actually I am a bit confused about what is really reading leanpkg.path. Oh -- is this something the lean plugin does in VS Code?</p>",

To check files you then run <code>lean my_file.lean</code> or <code>lean --server</code> <em>from that directory</em>, this will pick up the correct leanpkg.path file.  I believe this is the solution that is easiest to maintain.</p>",
