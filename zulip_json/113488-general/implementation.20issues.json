        "content": "<p>Implementation issues occasionally have knock-on effects. For example the coercion <code>of_nat</code> from <code>nat</code> to <code>int</code> is not a generic coercion from <code>nat</code> to a monoid with 0 and 1, and as a consequence all of the standard coercion lemmas like <code>\\u(a+b)=\\u a+\\u b</code> have to be proved for <code>of_nat</code>separately, giving us <code>int.coe_nat_add</code> as well as <code>nat.cast_add</code>.</p>\n<p>My understanding from conversations here is that <code>of_nat</code> is a special case, as it is actually a constructor for <code>int</code> and is hence more efficient. However when it comes to computations we all know that <code>nat</code> is absurdly inefficient, anyone who is doing computations will be using <code>pnum</code> or <code>num</code> or whatever -- the binary version of <code>nat</code> which has been specifically designed to be harder to reason with but more efficient to compute with.</p>\n<p>When I arrived here I just assumed that <code>int</code> would be defined the way it's typically defined in a mathematics class -- the quotient of <code>nat x nat</code> by the usual equivalence relation. But it isn't, it's defined in a much more direct and probably quite sensible way. Similarly <code>rat</code> is actually defined as a pair <code>(n,d)</code> of an integer numerator, a positive nat denominator, and a proof that they're coprime. My impression from this is that for some reason quotients are to be avoided -- they are less efficient or less computable in some way. This came up today when discussing polynomials with undergraduates -- someone suggested that a polynomial in one variable could be implemented as a list of coefficients, and I pointed out that leading zeros meant that it would have to be a quotient of list and this might well make it less computationally efficient or something. But then it occurred to me that actually they're defined as finsupps, which need finsets, which are multisets plus a theorem, and a multiset is a nightmarish quotient of list by some extremely delicate and hard to work with equivalence relation which in practice anyone using multiset other than developers stays well away from. Looking at it this way, it looks to me that in terms of sheer content of what is going on, defining polynomials in 1 variable as lists modulo \"we're the same modulo a bunch of zeros at the end\" looks to have far less baggage associated with it than this finsupp/finset/multiset/list.perm.setoid approach.</p>\n<p>So what exactly is informing these decisions? Why do we use nat at all? <code>num</code> is better, we could prove all the right induction etc lemmas for it, etc. Similarly, <code>list.perm.setoid</code> seems to ultimately rely on the fact that every automorphism of [0,n-1] can be written as a possibly huge product of swaps of consecutive nats, which is a terrible way to do permutation groups from the point of view of computation. As a mathematician all I care about is the theorems, but it seems to me that from a computational perspective Lean is in some sense a disaster -- it wasn't designed to do computations -- so why am I having to jump through all these hoops to prove results about coercions from nat to int?</p>",

So in the VM, a <code>multiset</code> just looks like a <code>list</code>--there are no actual big products of transpositions.</p>\n<p>The issue with using quotients for <code>int</code> and <code>rat</code> is that you could then end up with arbitrarily large representations of the same value of Z (0 = \"N - N\" for large N) or of Q (1 = \"N/N\" for large N).
