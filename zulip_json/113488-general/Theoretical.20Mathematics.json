There are various important questions to be answered about these structures that can be stated as formal mathematical propositions, and</p>\n<p>P. the task of the mathematician is to seek a deductive pathway from the axioms to the propositions or to their denials.</p>\n<p>All, in all, an interesting paper to read.</p>",

I fear that the problem will get worse over time. I absolutely appreciate Thurston's point of view but I think that when papers of my colleagues announce new results which depend on (a) unpublished work and (b) work which in my opinion has not been checked carefully enough by experts, then I begin to lose trust in it. My community however does not. This is independent of Thurston's main point, which is that doing new mathematics involves creativity and some kind of model of what is going on. </p>\n<p>Whenever someone brings up Thurston's article now I always tell them to not to forget to read <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9307227\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9307227\">the article by Jaffe and Quinn</a> which it was responding to (and which implicitly criticises Thurston for not giving enough proof details for one of the major claims he made).</p>",

Fermat's Last Theorem is just at the boundary of what one person can really understand, but it could only rely on 30 years of deep algebraic geometry because that's all the human race had had time to construct by then. Things are worse now. Stuff gets simplified and new stuff appears, and the shapes of proofs change, but ultimately it seems to me that things just rely on more and more and more material.</p>",

I especially agree with the part about papers claiming they've proven results, but not actually having complete proofs,  but since the result is proven there is little incentive to try to make a more rigorous proof.  There's definitely been a few topics in CS that I've stayed away from because the accepted papers don't seem to have a correct proof (or at least have inferences that I can't follow), but also I can't find a counterexample stating the theorem is wrong.</p>",

For me, it means did you actually think through why a particular program should work as intended on all cases, which often isn't true even for code in widely used software.  Whereas I think his and your interpretation interprets it as meaning \"did you specify the code or mathematical proof precisely\".  Getting a computer program to run requires a level of precision not found in mathematics, but as everybody knows that doesn't mean it is actually doing only what was intended.</p>",
