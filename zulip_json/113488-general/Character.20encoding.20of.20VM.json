Moreover, it's not the decoder implementation being slow---just asking that each <code>char</code> be replaced by its <code>nat</code> value as a string via mapping <code>char.val</code> over it (and trying to be efficient, appending each resulting <code>char</code> one-at-a-time and not doing list joins) takes this long too.</p>\n<p>In comparison, parsing such a buffer into the <code>expr</code> it represents takes milliseconds.</p>\n<p>This makes me very sad---would you at all consider merging a patch to lean which by default transcodes UTF-8 characters when reading and writing, when the file stream was opened in non-binary mode? The patch is under 100 lines. We address your <code>fs_read</code> problem above by reading the UTF-8 characters, making the length argument a number of UTF-8 characters, not just bytes (and again, this would only be in non-binary mode).</p>",
