The simplest “proof” of 2 + 2 = 4 is literally one keyword, <code>rfl</code> so there isn’t really an advantage of generating that sort of proof automatically.  But sometimes Lean (especially Lean 3) isn’t fast enough to compute things directly, so tactics like <code>norm_num</code> come in handy by finding shortcuts to the solution and generating a proof that it is equal.  Tactics are the main use case in Lean where proofs (and sometimes lemmas) are generated automatically.  Tactics work at the level of expressions and therefore get around what <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110032\">@Reid Barton</span>  was saying about 2+2 and 4 being treated the same.  So you are probably looking to use an existing tactic like norm_num or to make your own, but tactics are most useful as tools to build proofs.  (You could also build a custom user command out of tactics to make a <code>calculate</code> user command which runs norm_num, and returns the proof and result.)  Your questions are starting to get into metaprogramming and tactic writing, so again before you get too far down this rabbit hole it might help to clarify what sort of application you have in mind.</p>\n<p>(Also note norm_num is for Lean 3 and I don’t know if it has been ported yet.  <code>refl</code> seems pretty fast in Lean 4, so I wonder if norm_num will be needed much.)</p>",

(Also see the OP’s other question: <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"270676\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/getting.20from.20.23eval.20to.20a.20proof.2E\">#lean4 &gt; getting from #eval to a proof.</a>)  Here is another attempt at an answer to the very first part of this question.  Lean, when used as a programming language, just like any other programming language, calculates expressions before saving them to memory. If I type x = 2+2 in Python, it will evaluate 2+2 before saving it as an object in memory.  It is similar when I say let x = 2+2 in Lean.  This might be the OP had in mind for arrays.  As a theorem prover however, Lean has to preserve  expressions, so a Theorem <code>2+2=4</code> is not evaluated to 4=4 since that would change the theorem.  But as Reid said Lean’s functions have to respect equality, so no function would ever treat 2+2 different than 4.  (As for metaprogramming, like tactics, they often work on expressions, and the expression 2+2 is not equal to the expression 4, so that lets you do things like simplify an expression or rewrite part of an expression when you run a tactic.)</p>",

It uses a slightly different approach wich leverages the fact that Nat.add and Nat.mul are kernel-computable, but the tactic is still needed since in complicated types like <code>real</code>, <code>2 + 2 = 4</code> may not be <code>rfl</code>.</p>",
