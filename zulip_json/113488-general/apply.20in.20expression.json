Assume that lemma <code>foo</code> tells me that <code>Q</code> can be deduced from <code>P</code>. Now, I have in the middle of a proof a goal of the form <code>∀x, Q x</code>, and I would like to reduce it to <code>∀x, P x</code> without introducing <code>x</code>. Just like <code>simp</code> would do instead of <code>rw</code>, but for implications instead of equivalences. Is this possible?</p>",
