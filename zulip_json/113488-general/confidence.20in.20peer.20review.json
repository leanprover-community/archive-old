Hence all the theorems in the other files which use those theorems -- you don't have to justify why the use is OK and no mathematician would complain. However at the top end of mathematics you have people writing down arguments which contain hugely general statements which experts understand can be justified and such people would argue until they're blue in the face that the arguments were rigorous. So your question isn't really well-defined. Rigour is in the eye of the beholder. Lean is just one example of a beholder.</p>",
