I appreciate its not a finished product so feel free to ignore me but I had two problems getting it to work on my machine: </p>\n<p>I'm on OSX and the built in <code>grep</code> does not support <code>-oP</code> instead I had to replace it with a perl one-liner <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/16658690/2105639\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/16658690/2105639\">https://stackoverflow.com/a/16658690/2105639</a> it would be nice if this was built in (either perl everywhere? or some case switching depending on the OS) (I can try and send you a patch if you like).</p>\n<p>The second is that commit <a href=\"https://github.com/gebner/mathlib/commit/f073946e12676ae0dd0ae87ac4d2a300fd4c082b\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/gebner/mathlib/commit/f073946e12676ae0dd0ae87ac4d2a300fd4c082b\">https://github.com/gebner/mathlib/commit/f073946e12676ae0dd0ae87ac4d2a300fd4c082b</a> breaks everything for me, is my version of lean-community/lean:3.5.0 missing something that yours has?</p>\n<p>With these two caveats I got it to run both with vampire and eprover-ho in the end, its very cool (and surprisingly the generated proofs are almost readable), thanks for your great work I can't wait till its done!</p>",
