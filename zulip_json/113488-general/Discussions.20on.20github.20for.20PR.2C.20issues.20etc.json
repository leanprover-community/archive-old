I have a hard time to follow all the discussions on Zulip, so I'm often missing why a parch in a PR is done in the specific way. Is it possible to have the discussions witch are PR specific on github itself?</p>\n<p>For example for <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/339\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/339\">https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/pull/339</a> I remember skimming over Zulip and that there was a discussion about the <code>coeff</code> map instead of using coercion to functions.</p>\n<p>The advantage of linking of copying the discussion to the PR itself is that we can later see why a certain change was done. And I try to reference the github PR in the git commit message.</p>",
