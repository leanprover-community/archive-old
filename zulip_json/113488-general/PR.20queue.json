But, crucially, please do not forget to remove this label once the dependencies are merged, because otherwise it will not show up on the above list.</li>\n<li>If one of our lovely bots has determined that there is a merge conflict it will label your PR with <code>merge-conflict</code>. Please fix the conflict, and then the bot will remove the label again.</li>\n</ol>",
