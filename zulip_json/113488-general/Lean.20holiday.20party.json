I'd like to test it out (with more than two people) before the official event. So let's try a slightly bigger gathering on Tuesday: a \"holiday party\" at <time datetime=\"2020-12-22T17:00:00Z\">2020-12-22T12:00:00-05:00</time>  (noon EST). Cocktail hour for the Europeans, lunchtime on the east coast, morning coffee on the west coast. Come hang out and chat for a bit!</p>",
