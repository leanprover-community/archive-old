There are several node types: simple (primitive operation), gamma (branches), theta (do-while), lambdas, delta (global constants), and phi (mutual recursion &amp; primitive recursion). Phi can only contain lambdas. Due to normalization regions shouldn't really be lists of nodes because the order is irrelevant. The edges connect node outputs and region arguments to node inputs and region results. The edges represent data as either values or state; where state imposes strict ordering but may be fine grained (I.e. non-aliased memory accesses are unordered unless explicitly sequenced).</p>\n<p>The operations need to be a type parameter representing the respective dialects. Let this be GrTT, RISC-V, WASM, or SPIRV. A simple node inherits the input and output types from the primitive operations. I.e. RISC-V <code>addi</code> takes one input integer register and a signed 12-bit immediate value, which then returns a single XLEN integer register. All composition must preserve these types.</p>\n<p>For equality saturation each node or set of nodes or region may have multiple equivalent implementations. As optimization works by adding equivalent alternatives without destructively corrupting the graph. Sharing all common subgraphs along the way.</p>\n<p>Reconsidering set; I'd have to pairwise query the set to recover its members for analysis... so that was probably the wrong tool to reach for.

Correctly erasing the binder from value reach. Similarly linear arrows <code>\\-o</code> are <code>Pi</code>-type whose value-usage is one. In addition to the quantities, I'll be tracking sensitive dataflow for taint analysis. Classified data may not be made public (without and only after explicit declassification) and may not be translated to observable data-dependent machine code (at least for the RISC-V target; I can't exactly rely on either WASM nor SPIRV for this kind of safety --- even for RISC-V the specification doesn't require add/mul et al to be constant-time; though there is a proposed extension (which I can't find...) which adds this.)</p>",
