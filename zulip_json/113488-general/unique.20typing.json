You can be more refined though, since for a specific proof you only need n inaccessibles for some n &lt; omega. It might be possible to even trim down the universes themselves so that they aren't quite grothendieck universes, and then maybe you can fit it all in ZFC, but this probably fails in some extreme cases (like when constructing a model of ZFC in lean)</p>",
