This is weird because, on <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/commits/redefine_Schemes\">another branch of mine</a>, the latest build worked fine, even though its changes are a strict superset of the changes of the first branch. I downloaded the olean cache of the failed build, but I couldn't reproduce the timeout. It works fine. Does anyone have some tips for how to diagnose this?</p>",
