There are others around who will have more to say on this. What I do know is that there is not currently any link between Lean and other theorem provers. Also, it seems that porting proofs would result in non-idiomatic Lean. (I am not enough of an expert to know if this is a big problem.)</p>",

It doesn't necessarily require extra axioms. The biggest problem, that keeps it from being usable in practice right now, is that e.g. Lean's current library and natural Lean style don't match Isabelle's current library and natural Isabelle style. If you could import the AFP and Isabelle standard library directly into Lean, you wouldn't get something that uses mathlib. You'd get an image of Isabelle in Lean, using Isabelle's <code>nat</code>, <code>int</code>, etc etc. It would have no connection to anything formalized in Lean and would be extremely hard to work with.</p>",
