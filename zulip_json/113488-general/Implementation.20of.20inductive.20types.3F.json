The description looked like it was for personal introductions.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, I'm having some trouble understanding what the inductive type syntax actually does in terms of the most fundamental parts of CoC. Through some partial examples in the earlier parts of the Theorem Proving book, it made sense how the following could be used to axiomatically define what a boolean is:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">constant</span> <span class=\"n\">my_bool</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">namespace</span> <span class=\"n\">my_bool</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">constant</span> <span class=\"n\">true</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">my_bool</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">constant</span> <span class=\"n\">false</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">my_bool</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">end</span> <span class=\"n\">my_bool</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Following up with <code>#print axioms my_bool.true</code> prints out the two axioms it is dependent on. In contrast, I've seen <code>bool</code> be declared as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">inductive</span> <span class=\"n\">bool</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span>\n<span class=\"bp\">|</span> <span class=\"n\">ff</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">bool</span>\n<span class=\"bp\">|</span> <span class=\"n\">tt</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">bool</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This requires no axioms, which is what's confusing me at the moment. The Theorem Proving book has a chapter dedicated to this, but it seems focused on descriptions of what inductive types can do and how they can be used. Is there some way I can see what this syntax represents, or is it an extension of CoC which cannot be expressed as more verbose components?</p>",
