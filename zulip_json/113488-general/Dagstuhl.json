But perhaps it's also worth noting that even within the maths departments I've worked in, the logicians feel like a separate group to the rest of the researchers; Berkeley was a great example, where the logicians occupied a different floor to the other pure mathematicians and I think that in my 2 years there I didn't ever bump into any. On the other hand I had plenty of mathematical interactions with geometers, topologists and algebraists when I was there (I'm a number theorist). I very much felt with the logicians that it was a case of \"they don't know anything about what we do, and we don't really care what they're doing, for the most part\". Logicians have always felt very much like the outsiders in mathematics departments I've worked in. Of course this is just my personal impression.</p>",

Most of the people doing this have no idea what the law of the excluded middle or constructive maths is. You're right that the computer scientists I'm talking about are the ones I've met here though, which I'm sure is not at all a representative sample. Moreover, these mathematicians I'm talking about for the most part have no idea that things like Coq exist, either that or they do know but don't care.</p>",
