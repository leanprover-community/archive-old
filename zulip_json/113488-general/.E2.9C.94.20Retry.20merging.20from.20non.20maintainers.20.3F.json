I'm asking this for <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/12118\">#12118</a>, which was accepted by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"214703\">@Yury G. Kudryashov</span> but couldn't be merged because it no longer compiled with current master (if you're curious, the problem was that you can no longer use <code>finite</code> to mean <code>set.finite</code> even though the <code>set</code> namespace is open). So I merged master and fixed it, but I don't know how to tell bors to try again.</p>",
