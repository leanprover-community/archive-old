Sometimes I work on a PR, and instead of merging <code>lean-3.5.1</code> into the branch, I merge <code>master</code> into the branch. And then all of a sudden, I need to recompile a whole bunch of stuff, because a can't pull binaries from github.</p>\n<p>I wouldn't mind if we only store one set of binaries per day + <code>master</code>. So we could throw away the binaries from old <code>master</code> as soon as a new commit arrives. Does that make sense?</p>",
