Anyways, I'm also new to Zulip so I'm not sure if this is the format for asking questions.  So if it's not, surely an admin can help me make a correction.  </p>\n<p>I'm creating a class that extends classes x_1 and x_2. However,  x_1 and x_2 both extend class z.  Thus, they share a field.  </p>\n<p>I'm receiving an error message saying \"Invalid 'structure' header\" because one of the fields in x_1 was already declared by x_2.</p>\n<p>Does Lean have some kind of mechanism that I can use to avoid this error message?  I feel like Lean should be smart enough to know that<br>\nif I'm extending two classes, and they share a field that it should only be declared once.</p>",
