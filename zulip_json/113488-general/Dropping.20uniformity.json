        "content": "<p>I've been working with uniform spaces quite a lot recently, and one really annoying thing that keeps coming over and over is that we have to used forms for talking about the uniformity filter : </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/uniformity\">docs#uniformity</a>, with the nice notation <code>ùì§</code></li>\n<li><code>uniform_space.to_core.uniformity</code>, which quite a lot of lemmas are written for (see e.g <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/inf_uniformity\">docs#inf_uniformity</a>, I introduced the primed version recently to use <code>ùì§</code>), and more importantly, keeps coming over because using <code>ext</code> turns equalities of uniform spaces to equalities of their <code>uniform_space.to_core.uniformity</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I see too main options to fix that. The easy one is to declare that <code>uniform_space.to_core.uniformity</code> is an implementation detail, change all the lemmas to use <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/uniformity\">docs#uniformity</a>, including the <code>@[ext]</code> lemma <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/uniform_space_eq\">docs#uniform_space_eq</a>. </p>\n<p>The more extreme solution would be to just remove <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/uniformity\">docs#uniformity</a> and use the nice notation for <code>uniform_space.to_core.uniformity</code>. I did that just for the basic file in draft PR <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14694\">#14694</a> if you want to have a look. Here are some pros and cons for this solution :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>pro : all the current uses of the notation seem to continue working flawlessly</li>\n<li>pro : when then <code>uniform_space</code> needs to be explicit, one can use <code>u.uniformity</code> instead of <code>@uniformity _ u</code>, but unfortunately</li>\n<li>con : due to the usual problems of dot notation, when writing <code>u.uniformity</code>, an extra type annotation is often needed, like <code>(u : uniform_space Œ±).uniformity</code>. That said, I do prefer type annotation over <code>@</code>s and <code>_</code>s, but that's a personal preference</li>\n<li>con : the nice notation does not appear in the infoview (I guess this is because it's a \"complicated\" definition, in that it doesn't correspond to just one simple function application ?)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There might also be a solution involving <code>abbreviation</code> or <code>reducible</code> definitions, but I'm not familiar enough with this kind of things yet, so if you have any suggestion please let me know !</p>",
