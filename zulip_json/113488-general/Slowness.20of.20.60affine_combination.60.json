The issue isn't at all specific to that PR, however - the slowness can be seem for lots of lemma statements in <code>linear_algebra.affine_space.combination</code>, it's just that six uses of <code>affine_combination</code> in the same lemma statement is enough for the slowness to result in a timeout.</p>\n<p>Can someone figure out why Lean is so slow working with <code>affine_combination</code> and how to fix that slowness?</p>",
