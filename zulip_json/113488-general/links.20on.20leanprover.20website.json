And maybe also add a visible link from the documentation page. If you want something which is specifically about documentation then you can target <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html</a>. The download page could contain a link to  <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html</a>. And of course getting of the link to <a href=\"https://leanprover.github.io/live/\">https://leanprover.github.io/live/</a> would be awesome</p>",
