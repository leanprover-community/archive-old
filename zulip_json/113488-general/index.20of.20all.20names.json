The reason this may be useful is in the hypothetical scenario where you have a lot of declarations in a namespace (say <code>gwz</code>) that you want to move to the root namespace. But you need to avoid name conflicts with names from files that you haven't imported. Such an index would be an easy way to figure out that you need to append <code>'''</code> to <code>mul_div_cancel</code> to make it unique.</p>",
