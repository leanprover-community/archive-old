See <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/blob/0e4fbe2eb9f4f218c57628ec5c2b54a46434d801/src/infoview.ts#L236\">this hack</a>. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/compare/master...bryangingechen:pasteGoal?expand=1\">Here's</a> what I have so far. I think it gets the correct goal text, but as mentioned it puts it at the wrong position. I can try to figure out how to paste at the cursor instead, but any suggestions on how best to do this without adding even more layers of hacks would be welcome.</p>\n<p>Also, while playing around with this, I came up with a related feature request: in the widget view, I'd like to be able to click on a hypothesis name or the goal symbol (these currently are unlinked) and have the extension copy the hypothesis or goal to the clipboard. We can currently sort of do this by clicking on the head symbol of the expression and clicking the copy-to-clipboard button in the widget popup, but finding the right symbol to hover over can be fiddly.</p>\n<p>cc: <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"121918\">@Edward Ayers</span></p>",
