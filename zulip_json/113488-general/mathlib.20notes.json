GHC has around 2000 of these notes.<br>\nI'd like to adopt this in mathlib. For example, in category theory we have a convention of declaring universe variables in a particular order; this needs to happen in every file and <code>-- see Note [universe order in category theory]</code> would be a convenient way to document each occurrence.<br>\nSince we currently have none of these notes, maybe it would be good to establish a conventional format, so that they're easy to search for.</p>",
