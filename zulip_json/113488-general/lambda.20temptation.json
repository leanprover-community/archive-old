In mathematics, the same idea (bound variables) seems to be reinvented over and over and over. If you look at notations like indexed unions, <code>argmax</code> and sums, there are a lot of vary different conventions in application. I think it's worth streamlining those notations and writing conceptually similar things with similar notations.</p>",
