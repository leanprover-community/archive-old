I like the conciseness gained by removing the namespace <code>list</code>.</p>\n<p>However, I had started to sour on it then, and, after returning to my code and trying to refresh my working cache, I find that I no longer like it. Since the field notation differs from the definition notation and from the pretty-printed <code>lean</code> output in errors, going back and forth between notations requires repeatedly reorienting on the positions of arguments. (While <code>list.map</code> is a nice example for advocating use of the notation, when a definition has more than 2 parameters or typically needs bracketed arguments, the notation does not help.)</p>\n<p>If we could write definitions using namespace field notation and if the notation were used by <code>lean</code> to pretty-print, I believe the benefit would become clear. Otherwise, I don't think I'll be using it much.</p>\n<p>What do you think?</p>",
