Does anyone have an idea why the <code>simp_nf</code> linter doesn't notice? I checked nolints and don't see any obvious reason for it to not be found, but I stumbled on this in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/3812\">#3812</a> where the only essential difference is that the names of these lemmas have changed.</p>",
