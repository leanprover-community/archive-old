But in most applications in measure theory there is only one measurable space per type. Borel- vs. Lebesgue-measurable is a special case, and I think the best way to handle it is a special way to talk about completions.</p>\n<p>In Isabelle I developed measure theory without using the type class mechanism. And it is very annoying. In 90% of all cases you only have one measurable space. But in Isabelle it was not possible to use a theorem which uses a type class instance to instantiate with something different (this is now possible, but very ugly). In Lean we can use different measurable spaces, even when it is a little bit of a hassle to use the <code>@</code>-syntax and hope that the simplifier accepts our instances.</p>",
