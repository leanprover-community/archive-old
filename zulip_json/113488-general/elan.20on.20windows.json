Running \"which leanpkg\" reports \"/c/Users/Neil Strickland/.elan/bin/leanpkg\".  Note that this is not the path that is causing trouble above.   I think that leanpkg is actually starting and producing the above error message.  However, looking at <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/leanpkg/leanpkg/main.lean\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/leanpkg/leanpkg/main.lean\">https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/leanpkg/leanpkg/main.lean</a> suggests that \"leanpkg --help\" should always run correctly without needing to resolve any paths.  On the other hand, it is strange that /c/Users/Neil Strickland/.elan/bin/ contains four executables (lean.exe, elan.exe, leanpkg.exe and leanchecker.exe) which cmp tells me are byte-for-byte identical.  So probably that leanpkg.exe involves some kind of wrapper that is producing the error message.</p>\n<p>I have not been able to work out where leanpkg is getting the bad path from.  I looked in various places under /c/Users/Neil Strickland/.elan and /c/Users/Neil Strickland/.vscode and /c/Users/Neil Strickland/AppData/Roaming/Visual Studio Code without success.  Running \"env\" under Git bash also does not enlighten me.</p>\n<p>In general, the problem with spaces in paths in Lean seems to arise as follows.  The only Windows system call anywhere in the Lean code seems to be a CreateProcess() at line 221 of <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/src/library/process.cpp\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/src/library/process.cpp\">https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/src/library/process.cpp</a>.  On lines 70,74,77 of <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/leanpkg/leanpkg/resolve.lean\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/leanpkg/leanpkg/resolve.lean\">https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/leanpkg/leanpkg/resolve.lean</a> there are calls to exec_cmd which end up using the above system call to start Git.  This is probably appropriate, but the arguments should be escaped properly.  However, in various other places in resolve.lean and main.lean the functions exec_cmd and io.proc.spawn are used to create directories and check for the existence of files and directories.  These could again be fixed by escaping the arguments properly but it would be much more appropriate and robust to refactor the code to  use the system calls CreateDirectory() and PathFileExists() (and their POSIX equivalents) directly.</p>\n<p>Probably some of the above commentary should be converted to issues on github.  But I am not yet properly familiar with how everything fits together.</p>",
