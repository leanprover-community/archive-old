It does the bracket highlighting by adding syntax highlighting, so it doesn't work in the HTML view we use for the info view.  We could of course implement this (and/or bracket matching) ourselves, but I think it would be quite a bit of work.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure what you mean by \"external pretty printers\".</p>",
