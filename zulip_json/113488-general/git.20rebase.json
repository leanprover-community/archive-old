I understand that we don't want horrible history in mathlib, but if a PR is accepted by mathlib then they can fix things up (e.g. by squishing the entire commit history into one commit). Are you saying I should rebase anyway? Of course anything is fine by me, I'm happy to do what I'm told here.</p>",
