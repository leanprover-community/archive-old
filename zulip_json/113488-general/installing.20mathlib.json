It would probably also work to stick with git bash but arrange for the PATH variable used by git bash to be set so that python can be found elsewhere.  But I am not sure exactly where git bash gets its PATH from.  Anyway, the current installation instructions  are certainly not satisfactory if you want to have update-mathlib.
