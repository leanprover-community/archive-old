If the character is divisible by inserting a space, then it should also be partially selectable, you should be able to put the cursor in the middle, etc.  What makes the vscode behavior so weird is that it is inconsistent.  The column number and the key input treat it as two characters, while selection and cursor display treat it as a single character.</p>\n<p>For a general-purpose editor I think <code>स्</code> should count as one character.  Otherwise you could conclude with the same argument that inserting a space in <code>Ö</code> should result in <code>O ̈</code> (which to be clear, is not useful in any way).</p>",
