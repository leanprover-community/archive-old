To prevent that, we define <code>decode2</code> to be <code>decode</code> on <code>set.range encode</code> and <code>none</code> elsewhere.<br>\nIn practice, it seems that <code>decode2</code> is the function that actually gets used, as it is better behaved. What do people think of renaming <code>decode</code> to <code>decode'</code> and <code>decode2</code> to <code>decode</code>? This could go along with restating some lemmas that are currently about <code>decode</code>.</p>",
