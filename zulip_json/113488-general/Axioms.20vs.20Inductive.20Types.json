For example, you could use an axiom introducing large cardinal assumptions like in set theory.  You could also use it to play around with foundations which are not as strong as the axiom of choice.  But note axioms are purposely behind the scenes, so if you use them they will be available to all of your later code to use.  For example, it isn’t easy to do constructive math using tactics in lean since a lot of tactics bring in one of lean’s non-constructive axioms.  Also, I’m pretty sure no code using axioms would be accepted into mathlib.  I think in many cases it would be better to just include the “axiom” (like a large cardinal assumption) as a hypothesis to the theorem.</p>",
