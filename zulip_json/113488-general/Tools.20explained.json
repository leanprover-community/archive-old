I got a bit tired at the end, but I hope the main points are there. I put a draft at <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/PatrickMassot/68109ad8143dcdced860f1aed3495fc9\" title=\"https://gist.github.com/PatrickMassot/68109ad8143dcdced860f1aed3495fc9\">https://gist.github.com/PatrickMassot/68109ad8143dcdced860f1aed3495fc9</a>. Comments are welcome. I think even moderately experienced users could learn a thing or two, or at least enjoy the global view. If some people like it I'll propose some version of this in the community documentation.</p>",
