Just the definitions of category, functor, natural transformation, and compositions of these.<br>\n2. Also some basic constructions, e.g. functor categories, and product categories.<br>\n3. Also definitions of basic notions such as products, equalizers, and limits.<br>\n4. Also an example, e.g. showing that the category of types has limits.</p>\n<p>(I could add many more things, but I think that's probably more than enough for a single PR.)</p>\n<p>Essentially it's a question about whether it's easier to have things in very small increments, or easier to have bigger blocks, so that design decisions can be validated by examples and applications.</p>",
