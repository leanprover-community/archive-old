But I got Lean version 3.42.1 instead of the curent version 4.0.0. Somewhere is written that Lean 4 doesn't has the mathlib library. Another source writes that Lean 4 doesn't use leanpkg.toml, that would be a Lean 3 thing. But elan works with leanpkg.toml.<br>\n1.) Are these information still up to date?<br>\n2.) What is the right directory for installing Lean 4.0.0?</p>",
