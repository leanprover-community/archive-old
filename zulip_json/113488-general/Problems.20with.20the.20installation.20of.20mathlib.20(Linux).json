I did the following</p>\n<p>leanpkg new my_project<br>\n  cd my_project<br>\n  leanpkg add leanprover/mathlib</p>\n<p>then I created a test.lean file with import group_theory.subgroup and then #check is_subgroup, and I run</p>\n<p>leanpkg build</p>\n<p>but although I can see all .olean files in my_project/_target/deps/mathlib/group_theory/, I get the following error message in VS Code: </p>\n<p>\"invalid import: group_theory.subgroup<br>\n could not resolve import: group_theory.subgroup\"</p>\n<p>(although I heard that it is less crucial now, I also installed elan as described in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/blob/master/docs/elan.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/blob/master/docs/elan.md\">https://github.com/leanprover/mathlib/blob/master/docs/elan.md</a>).</p>\n<p>After a few unsuccessful attempts, I decided to install mathlib globally instead with</p>\n<p>leanpkg install leanprover/mathlib</p>\n<p>now I have all .olean files in ~/.lean/_target/deps/mathlib but I am still getting the same error.</p>\n<p>Finally, I am using Ubuntu and VS Code works perfectly in other Lean projects without mathlib.</p>\n<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nBruno</p>",
