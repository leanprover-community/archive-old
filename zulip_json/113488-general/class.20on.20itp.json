        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110865\">@Jeremy Avigad</span> my experience with CoCalc is: first, you have to pay to get a reliable service. Second, there is one thing which in my mind might not go as smoothly as one might hope. I don't know if this situation will apply to you. The homeworks I want to give out are lean files which rely on two dependencies: firstly mathlib, and secondly a (very) small library of my own. I decided I would make a github repo for the homework (and put my library in /src). But it seems crazy to actually make the contents <code>_target/deps/mathlib</code> be part of the homework I set, because then everyone would get a new mathlib for every homework. This might be one way of doing it. But there's a mathlib installed on CoCalc, so one way of doing it would be to hack together an appropriate <code>leanpkg.path</code> which is CoCalc-specific. Unfortunately I have not had the time to think about this problem, because our ICT guys actually made Lean really easy to use on our local machines this year (the students click on VS Code and it opens a Lean project, the extension is installed, the path to Lean is correct -- it just works straight out of the box) so most people have been using Lean on our local machines. It's high priority to make all this work really smoothly on CoCalc but I have not ironed out these details yet. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"116034\">@William Stein</span> I plan to work on this at some point but this is a summary of where I am now. I am not running a course -- everything is completely informal with me, and students are still learning the basics, so I have not had to think too hard about this yet. But within a week or so I will have to engage with this issue.</p>",

I know enough to point students to Chlipala's CPDT and FRAP, and Nipkow and Klein's Concrete Semantics. Porting anything from those to Lean is a reasonable project. If I have any students that are looking for something more creative, I'll send them to you.<br>\nAnd thanks, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110038\">@Kevin Buzzard</span>. This is helpful. I have got until January to figure it out, so I'll likely come back with more specific questions later.</p>",
