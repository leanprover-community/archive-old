Many of us already use theorem provers in our daily work. We'd love more. Jeff Zucker is still here, even though he's retired; he did his PhD formalizing Real Analysis in Automath in the early 1970s! And of course there's Bill Farmer too, co-author of IMPS. Wolfram Kahl and I are quite active around Agda. Mark Lawford uses PVS a fair bit. Others use model checkers, and so on.</p>\n<p>Your main work should have a definite CS/SE flavour though. We are called \"Computing &amp; Software\", after all.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://careers.mcmaster.ca/psp/prepprd/EMPLOYEE/HRMS/c/HRS_HRAM.HRS_APP_SCHJOB.GBL?Page=HRS_APP_JBPST&amp;Action=U&amp;FOCUS=Applicant&amp;SiteId=1000&amp;JobOpeningId=35597&amp;PostingSeq=1\">https://careers.mcmaster.ca/psp/prepprd/EMPLOYEE/HRMS/c/HRS_HRAM.HRS_APP_SCHJOB.GBL?Page=HRS_APP_JBPST&amp;Action=U&amp;FOCUS=Applicant&amp;SiteId=1000&amp;JobOpeningId=35597&amp;PostingSeq=1</a></p>",
