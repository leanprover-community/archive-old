It installs Git, Elan with nightly, VS Code, and the Lean extension, then it sets up a project directory with mathlib + a few sample files, then it opens that directory in VS Code.  At this stage I would only recommend it to people who already know what they are doing.  The installer does not currently tidy up after itself: it will leave a bunch of stuff in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Lean installer, including a log file, so that is a good place to look if something goes wrong.  If you try it, please let me know how it goes.  There is relevant code at <a href=\"https://github.com/NeilStrickland/lean_installer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/NeilStrickland/lean_installer\">https://github.com/NeilStrickland/lean_installer</a>.</p>",
