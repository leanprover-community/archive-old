Now things are very different -- for example I understand the \"point\" of a mathlib file now; to set up an API for the user so that someone like me can use multisets without having to worry about the fact that their definition is rather delicate so proving basic properties about them can be complicated. </p>\n<p>So what form should these docs take? How about using the Wiki feature of github? One wiki page per directory perhaps? Pages don't attempt to document everything, but instead flag the names of the main theorems and main definitions. I still don't know too much about lattices, but I note that when giving other things the structure of a lattice, \"sometimes &lt;= is defined to be &gt;=\", as it were (I forgot the specific example where this happened but I think it happens at least once). </p>\n<p>I don't think my approach with N,Z,Q etc of just writing down a bunch of random theorems and saying what their names are is a particularly good one.

I asked some questions here, wrote some basic first draft, PR'ed it, people told me about the noob mistakes I'd made, I edited it, it became a basic doc with some basic facts about <code>simp</code> which aren't mentioned in Theorem Proving In Lean (TPIL), and now I sometimes point people to it when they ask basic <code>simp</code> questions. We're not trying to be professional -- we're just trying to get basic facts down which are \"known to the experts\" but for which there is no reference. I would strongly encourage you to just post your personal docs as a PR to somewhere in the <code>docs</code> directory of mathlib.

More and more often it's things like \"topological groups\" or \"Noetherian rings\" or \"fundamental groups\" or \"linear maps\" or something -- and perhaps this part of the docs should be an attempt to answer such questions. Related questions are stuff like \"how much number theory is in Lean\"? Maybe we should be thinking more about writing really good answers to these questions.</p>",
