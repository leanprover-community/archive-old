In this case, both <code>algebra.trace</code> and <code>field_theory.finite.basic</code> seem to be reasonable; the two statements (the last two in <code>auxiliary.lean</code> as in the PR) refer to definitions from both files. But neither of these two files already imports the other (I checked that definitions from the other file are unknown in each file). So if I move the statements to one of these files, I'd have to add the import of the other file. Alternatively, I could set up a new file, say <code>field_theory.finite.trace</code> to contain the two, which imports the other two files.</p>\n<p>What would be the preferred way to proceed?</p>\n<p>I noticed that there are files in mathlib that contain only very few statements (in some cases, only one), so that seems to be OK.</p>",
