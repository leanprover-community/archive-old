        "content": "<p>I have always been confused about dot notation. I don't use it as much as other people, because I don't understand it as well as other people. I've read <a href=\"https://github.com/PatrickMassot/mathlib/blob/e5aad2e4e0964c7624183efdb534878b6a06bbb5/docs/extras/structures.md#about-the-namespace-shortcut\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/PatrickMassot/mathlib/blob/e5aad2e4e0964c7624183efdb534878b6a06bbb5/docs/extras/structures.md#about-the-namespace-shortcut\">Patrick's notes</a> on this and TPIL but I think there's more to it.</p>\n<p>I understand that if I make a new structure <code>structure point (α : Type) := (x : α) (y : α)</code> then for <code>p : point</code> I can use <code>p.x</code> instead of <code>point.x p</code>. I also understand that if we make more functions in the structure's namespace like <code>point.blah</code> (which for simplicity takes as input one point and possibly some other stuff) then <code>p.blah</code> is shorthand for <code>point.blah p</code> (or perhaps <code>point.blah _ _ p</code> if the point happens not to be the first thing that <code>point.blah</code> eats). </p>\n<p>What threw me yesterday when working on the perfectoid project was that my proof that if <code>neg</code> was a continuous function on a topological ring then it was also a continuous function on a subring looked like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"n\">continuous_neg</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">continuous_subtype_mk</span> <span class=\"bp\">_</span> <span class=\"err\">$</span>\n                    <span class=\"n\">continuous</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">comp</span>\n                      <span class=\"n\">continuous_subtype_val</span> <span class=\"err\">$</span>\n                      <span class=\"n\">topological_ring</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">continuous_neg</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>and then Patrick took one look at this code and pointed out that this could be written</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"n\">continuous_neg</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">continuous_subtype_mk</span> <span class=\"bp\">_</span> <span class=\"err\">$</span>\n                      <span class=\"n\">continuous_subtype_val</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">comp</span> <span class=\"err\">$</span>\n                      <span class=\"n\">topological_ring</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">continuous_neg</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>It took me a while to realise that he wasn't talking about some fancy new function in the topology directory in mathlib but was in fact advocating the use of the dot notation. It would never have occurred to me to try to use dot notation here. In the examples above, which I understand, we have <code>p : point</code>, i.e. a term whose type is a structure and then a function in the corresponding namespace. But here <code>continuous_subtype_val</code> has type <code>∀ {α : Type u} [_inst_1 : topological_space α] {p : α → Prop}, continuous subtype.val</code> which is definitely not a structure, and even if I remove all the implicit arguments then it becomes <code>continuous subtype.val</code> which is also not a structure, and even if I look at the head function then it's <code>continuous</code> which is also not a structure. But Patrick's code does work. I am fast coming to the conclusion that my understanding of dot notation is nowhere near complete.</p>\n<p>Investigating further, I find that <code>#check continuous_subtype_val.comp</code> works, even though there appears to be no function <code>continuous_subtype_val.comp</code>. Moreover, this seems to have nothing to do with structures at all, because <code>continuous</code> is not a structure, it's just a plain old definition. What seems to be going on in this situation is that if <code>p</code> has type <code>{implicit stuff} [more implicit stuff] foo x</code> and <code>foo</code> happens coincidentally to be both a function and a namespace (which is something that <code>continuous</code> seems to be, for some reason I don't understand) then <code>p.blah</code> is defined to mean <code>foo.blah p</code> . In some sense I am surprised that this is ever useful beyond the case I understand, i.e. structures. If <code>continuous_subtype_val</code> had happened to just take one explicit argument, which in a parallel universe it could have done, I am assuming that this trick would stop working.</p>\n<p>So is the philosophy something like \"if <code>foo</code> is any old function, and if I'm defining a function <code>f : foo x -&gt; y</code>, then I might want to consider calling the function <code>foo.f</code>because then I can write <code>f.p</code> if <code>p : foo x</code>? What I don't get is that if I had just called it <code>f</code> then I could have written <code>f p</code> which is just as many characters as <code>f.p</code> anyway. </p>\n<p>I guess I can understand that if <code>foo</code> is a structure and I wanted to define a <code>neg</code> on <code>foo x</code> then I would instinctively called it <code>foo.neg</code>. But I wouldn't do this for <code>continuous</code>. Is this evidence that <code>continuous</code> should be a structure? Are our naming conventions treating it like it is one?</p>\n<p>Confused in London.</p>",
