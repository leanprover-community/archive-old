I've spent some time recently asking undergraduates how they learn nowadays, and it really is very different to when I was learning material. In particular when learning programming languages like python, if a student is stuck on some basic thing they don't even read the materials which the lecturer has made available, they just google for their problem, and because python is such a popular language they find some stackoverflow question with 1000 upvotes. We cannot offer this service; right now, as you say, we are countering it by relying on the fact that we are a sufficiently small community (in comparison to something like python) that individual queries can be answered here, but of course the fact that we are small means that now is the time to get it right. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110596\">@Rob Lewis</span> has thought seriously about documentation.</p>",
