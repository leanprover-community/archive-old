        "content": "<p>Many answers are unknown, but there are a couple of facts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leo never promised any compatibility between Lean 3 and Lean 4. In fact he very explicitly warned everybody there won't be any compatibility, and we shouldn't build anything and expect it to work in Lean 4. He is on a mission to build a better proof assistant. He always writes this is a research project and not a product.</li>\n<li>Everything we do nonetheless in Lean 3 is worthwhile. The type class instance resolution procedure of Lean 4 has been developed using the experience gathered in mathlib. This is crucial.</li>\n<li>The tactic framework of Lean 4 doesn't exist yet, but one can be sure that not a single line of mathlib tactic code will work without modification in Lean 4.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Less certain pieces include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personally I think the community of mathematicians using Lean 3 is a huge success that will survive Lean 3.</li>\n<li>It may be possible to write code which automates at least partly the conversion of Lean 3 to Lean 4. I think the dream is that the Lean 4 parser will be flexible enough to parse Lean 3 code and output an approximate Lean 4 version.</li>\n<li>The mathlib community does not have a fixed plan for the transition. There cannot be a plan as long as we don't know more about the preceding point. </li>\n<li>I don't see any reason why mathlib would be more centralized than it currently is. There is no dictator who will say: mathlib is now frozen, everybody should work on porting. Everybody will continue doing whatever they want using whatever time they can find. We may have rules like: don't port and modify a file at the same time, since this could make a huge mess and create a lot of additional work.</li>\n</ul>",
