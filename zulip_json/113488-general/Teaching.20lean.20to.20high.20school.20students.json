Feedback on the sentence: &quot;Here’s the full code (together with some other stuff which you don’t need to worry about).&quot;\n-- I&#39;d probably avoid using `open` for now. Every bit of new notation introduced is a new thing to learn and can distort the &quot;bigger picture&quot;. Sure, typing xnat before everything is a pain, but they&#39;ll have plenty of time to learn all the shortcuts as they become more expert (i.e. after the first lesson).\n\n-- 2. Feedback on the sentence: &quot;Well no we can’t yet, because we haven’t defined add yet! Let’s add a definition of add. We’ll define it by induction! Well, more precisely, by recursion.&quot;\n-- I&#39;d like to see some verification/testing that my definition worked straight after the definition. For example something like this:\n-- #reduce add (xnat.succ xnat.zero) (xnat.succ (xnat.succ xnat.zero))\n\n-- 3. Feedback on the sentence &quot;Well, more precisely, by recursion. The idea is that a+0 will just be a, and a+succ(b) will just be succ(a+b).&quot;\n-- I&#39;m not sure how I feel about equation compiler. On one hand it makes everything look easy and is probably more beginner-friendly than recursors. On the other it is hiding quite a lot of seemingly important detail. It&#39;s a tought one!\n\n-- 4. Feedback on the sentence &quot;notation a + b := add a b&quot;\n-- same point applies as with `open`, but less strongly.\n\n-- 5. Feedback on the sentence: &quot;In fact there is an easier way — the tactic refl just unravels everything and then checks that you’re left with something of the&quot;\n-- Yes, the tactic works. Arguably an easier way to kill the goal would be without entering the tactic environment alltogether, `rfl` or `eq.refl _` or `eq.refl two`. But educationally what really matters is that all these proof strategies work because both `add (xnat.succ xnat.zero) (xnat.succ xnat.zero)` and `xnat.succ (xnat.succ xnat.zero)` reduce to the same term:\n-- #reduce add (xnat.succ xnat.zero) (xnat.succ xnat.zero)\n-- #reduce xnat.succ (xnat.succ xnat.zero)\n</pre></div>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110031\">@Patrick Massot</span> The first issue is that there are many flavors of type theory. SMT solvers, like Z3, are based on first-order logic, and the semantics is very well defined. Since each system implements a different flavor of type theory, we encountered big mismatches between the logic implemented by the potential customers (F-star, Coq) and the one implemented in Lean. We tried to interface F-star and Lean twice using different approaches, and it was an encoding mess. F-star is based on extensional type theory, has subtypes,  etc. We also found mismatches between what is a valid inductive datatype in Lean and F-star. We didn't try to interface with Coq, but I imagine we would also have many problems: no universe cumulativity in Lean, Fix Coq expressions vs Lean recursors, lack of proof-irrelevance in Coq, etc.  Another issue is that it is much harder to build robust end-game automation for DTT.  Here \"end-game\" means, it proves the goal or fail.  Z3 is used as an end-game tactic in F-star and Isabelle. Moreover, the automation must be integrated with system specific features (e.g., type class resolution). Non end-game tactics are not very useful since we have the logic mismatch issue. For example, suppose we have a goal in F-star, convert it into Lean, apply Lean's <code>simp</code>, and try to convert the result back into F-star. The result goal will probably be unreadable.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Thank you for all this information Leo, I'm sure it's really interesting, just a little bit beyond me to make any useful comments.</p>\n<p>So, about the kids, it went pretty well yesterday. The brightest have got as far as the end of chapter 3 of my tutorial (up to propositions as types + a little bit of playing around with equality, all with terms), pretty much by themselves, although of course with frequent hints from my side. This was after ~2 hours of workshop and they were pretty tired towards the end, so I walked them through chapter 4 (inductive types + recursors + commutativity of addition) on my own, lecture style. They've at least <em>seen it</em>, so if they decide to ever go back to this content, it will at least seem vaguely familiar.</p>\n<p>I've made a couple of observations:</p>\n<p>1. It came as a big shock to all of them that there were some technical concepts they couldn't grasp in a single sitting. That's understandable given that all of them are bright and all of them followed standard Scottish high school education (which is not exactly the world's most challenging).<br>\n2. Functional programming indeed proved to be a challenge, as predicted by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110596\">@Rob Lewis</span> and I didn't explain things as much as I should have. I received a standard array of question from pretty much every student, such as, what is a $\\lambda$, why do I not have to type brackets, why is this not typechecking (when evaluating a function on a term of incorrect type), etc. I reverted to a series of half-truths and rules of thumb (you need one $\\lambda$ per one arrow in your type signature, everything on the left of the colon is a value, everything to the right of the colon is the type, etc.)<br>\n3. Lean is great, because it gives me a topic I can talk with these kids, without the risk of complete cognitive disconnection, and I'm actually really enthusiastic about (as opposed to maths puzzles, or basic python programming, which I'm slightly less enthusiastic about).</p>",
