In the forward implication, I have that it's finite, and to show the \"other condition\". </p>\n<p>I could easily do so by using the well ordering theorem and the knowledge it has an upper bound on paper, but I'm not sure how to do this with lean. Equivalently, I've seen that finsets have a max defined for them, but I am unsure how to extract this as an object as I can abuse it's properties.</p>\n<p>I'd appreciate some direction towards more detailed resources on how finsets work, and how they interact with sets, or alternatively some simple examples of them being used. In particular, the <code>↥</code> symbol is confusing.</p>\n<p>I can provide details on the exact thing I'm trying to do / show if need be, but I'm still looking for more general help / resources on finsets.</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>",

But with formalisation you need to say exactly what you mean (e.g. by giving a <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mwe.html\">#mwe</a> with the precise statement of what you want, or something as near as possible). What hypotheses do you want on your set, for example? It need some kind of ordering. What kind? Would you allow two incomparable maxima? etc etc. You say \"the maximum\" and that's already making implicit assumptions. What is the actual exact question?</p>",

I know that doesn't answer your question of how to define it, but hopefully it gets the job done.
