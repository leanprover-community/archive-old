Yet, what at first glance seems to me to be a benefit of using <code>degree</code>, which is knowing that <code>degree f = 0</code> implies immediately that <code>f ≠ 0</code>, hasn't really come up in proofs about polynomials that I've done. </p>\n<p>What if we just removed <code>degree</code> from mathlib? Other than that it would be a huge messy refactor, would there be big drawbacks?</p>",
