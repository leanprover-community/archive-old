It feels like in so many examples we've seen it burn you later, either because Lean wanders off into \"heavy refl\" elaborations, or you find yourself writing things that don't quite make sense but \"Lean can see what you mean\" in very unintuitive ways, that are then impossible to read again later. Keeping <code>[reducible]</code> contained to small scopes shortly after the definition seems like a good hygiene regime --- it encourages you to get the API right at the point of definition, by preventing you from \"cheating\" later.</p>",
