        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"245078\">@Apurva Nakade</span> I think you are misunderstanding the role of mathlib. </p>\n<p>Mathlib is not supposed to be an educational resource which we can point beginners to and say \"look, here is how to do mathematics in Lean\". And it is <em>certainly</em> not supposed to be a teaching tool where people who don't know the mathematics and/or don't know any Lean can come and learn it. In the same way, Bourbaki is a series of books, but they are not educational textbooks which are supposed to be an introduction to the subject for beginners and they are not supposed to have lucid special cases in which make comprehension easier. I think your complaints are completely understandable, but also misguided, and are furthermore off-topic and theaten to derail an interesting thread. So let me first try and say something about the issues you raise and then let me get back to the original question.</p>\n<p>Yes mathlib might be completely unreadable and unusable for you, but I would say that if this is the case then perhaps you are not the target audience. The main point is that just because you, and most of my mathematics undergraduates, might think that the fundamental theorem of calculus is some statement about differentiating and integrating infinitely differentiable functions from the reals to the reals, the more general statement is something which a modern researcher in analysis needs  to build even more  complex theories on top of, so of course we prove the more general statement and deduce the classical result from it, and we are trying to make a tool which ultimately in some form will be used by modern researchers in analysis, and <em>not</em> a teaching tool.</p>\n<p>So what about my poor mathematics undergraduates who don't have a clue what a Banach space is but still want to learn some analysis or want to learn some lean? Well for them we have to create <em>different</em> resources which <em>sit on top of mathlib</em> and which are written to be understandable to be completely different (and much larger) set of people. This is the point of, for example, the <a href=\"https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/formalising-mathematics\">course I gave last year</a> where things like limits of sequences are defined in the standard way and theorems are proved about them in the standard way, and only later in the course is the link made to filters, after a whole lot of material explaining what filters are.</p>\n<p>If we were writing mathlib like that then I'm sure you would find it a much more beautiful object but I can be equally confident that the <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01627-2\">nature paper</a> explaining the liquid tensor experiment would not exist and as a result the community would be in a far worse state when it comes to things like funding, because it would have far less attention from experts.</p>\n<p>So this finally brings me back to the original question, \"where are we going\"? I see a future where tools running on top of Lean are used in education, from school level to PhD students. From simple proofs in geometry with some visual interface, to undergraduates working through formalised problem sheets using high-powered tactics and writing in a controlled natural language, to PhD researchers in algebraic geometry wanting to search for possibly-helpful results in a database of theorem statements, all of these things should be possible. For these things to happen, we need more tools. As Apurva has pointed out, mathlib is <em>not that tool</em>. However these tools, which would sit on top of mathlib rather than being equal to mathlib, are clearly within scope now and as smart people interested in mathematical education begin to understand the potential of the software, these tools will begin to appear.</p>",

Next it's true that both Isabelle's version and ours are much more advanced than the first statement of this theorem you might encounter. And indeed one can easily build teaching tools on top of mathlib. The tutorials project is an old version of my first year course using Lean. There I use a home made version of limits of sequences and functions. But it secretly uses mathlib's real numbers based on filters and when I need to use without proof Bolzano-Weirstrass in the last file I have a <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/tutorials/blob/master/src/solutions/tuto_lib.lean#L174-L188\">tiny bit of glue</a> needed to connect to mathlib's version.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I'm on my very early days into Lean and I too have some considerations on my learning experience, not only regarding Lean itself but also about getting into computer-assisted proofs.</p>\n<p>I agree that it makes sense for people to go through tutorials before they're able to write programmatic proofs. But for people with a lot of mathematical baggage, it might be very uninteresting to do so before they're able to understand the code. LaTeX is not a very extensible comparison because it outputs clean and beautiful portable documents, which is attractive enough. I am enjoying this learning experience because I'm into CS (a lot), but if I were a busy math researcher, with a lot to write, classes to organize, tests to formulate and correct and students to guide, I would have a strong excuse not to learn Lean or any other similar tool.</p>\n<p>Thus, I see a big opportunity on improving the readability and attractiveness of Lean code output. More powerful hover hints, better contextualization of auto-completions etc would help a lot. Yesterday I couldn't make the direct mental link that <code>rfl</code> means \"reflexivity\", for instance. Maybe also add a \"simplify\" tactic (like in Coq) for the sake of clarity if the author intends to go slower? Also pretty auto-generated and interactive HTML books would be a good hook IMO.</p>",
