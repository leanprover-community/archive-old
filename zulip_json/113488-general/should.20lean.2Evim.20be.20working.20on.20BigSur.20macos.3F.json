I got lean working in both VScode and emacs work on mac, so probably not a hardware thing. I have an Apple silicon mac mini with BigSur. The same lean and vim settings works on my Ubuntu 20.04. I attached the error in vim below. The plugin I use is coc.<br>\nRuning \"lean test.lean\" gives no error and shows the correct result of \"#check topological_space\".<br>\nMany thanks for any feedback!<br>\n<a href=\"user_uploads/3121/5khuwePQnqy-A7l8AdMbSM_Z/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"user_uploads/3121/5khuwePQnqy-A7l8AdMbSM_Z/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"user_uploads/3121/5khuwePQnqy-A7l8AdMbSM_Z/image.png\"></a></div>",

Great work!<br>\nA question off topic: given that Lean already has an official emacs version, and you are surely more than capable of creating a satisfying vim-like environment on top of that in emacs, why do you still choose to spend the time and develop lean.nvim?<br>\nIn general, I'm curious why you choose vim over emacs. Today I was questioning myself about this.</p>\n<p>I read people saying emacs can do everything vim can do, but not vice versa. I have been using vim for about a year, and now the keybindings and modes are very natural to me. But I just found out sagemath has an official emacs version (i've been using vim-jupyter), and of course Lean also has an emacs version. I question whether starting to seriously learn vim script is worth it. I began learning vim because it is everywhere, but I don't really need to access slow remote devices everyday, and perhaps  I already learned / adopt its best part, which I think is its modal design? With evil-mode in emacs, will it be more productive if I spend the time learning elisp instead of vimscript, if I want to pursue the goal of ultimately doing almost everything using only the keyboard, with only one set of custom keybindings?</p>\n<p>Thanks as usual!<br>\nP.S. Not sure if it's ok to post this question here. Perhaps I should move it to private message or ask you on github?</p>",
