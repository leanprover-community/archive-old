        "content": "<p>Hey everyone, first day back (after a whiiile) and I finally put together an example for the tactic-block caching stuff that people can try out. All you have to do is clone <a href=\"https://github.com/khoek/leancache-example.git\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/khoek/leancache-example.git\">https://github.com/khoek/leancache-example.git</a> (and make sure you have elan), and examine the <code>somemaths-xxx.lean</code> file in <code>src</code>. The files in there are shamelessly stolen from <code>lean-category-theory</code> and has a few statements which take a full 1- or 2-seconds to recompile normally (at least on my machine). You can turn caching on and off in the file by including <code>tactic.tcache.enable</code> (as stated there), as well as clear the cache and/or turn on some tracing to compare the performance with and without caching the proofs.</p>\n<p>Full disclosure: <code>leancache</code> as implemented uses a 50-line changed fork of lean <code>3.4.2</code> (which will be auto-fetched by elan and is why it's necessary). It doesn't have to do this at all (as in, I've got an implementation which runs in vanilla lean too), but using the fork leads to a factor of 500-1000 performance speedup, so I think it's a pretty good idea. This is compared to a simple in-lean serializer which is also in that repo and I can explain how to try out if people want.</p>",

        "content": "<p>To be clear, the fork just provides IO and serializing help, and does not have anything to do with saving and restoring the proofs. The addition to lean in the fork is simply the following: I add two functions in the <code>io</code> namespace called <code>io.serialize</code> and <code>io.deserialize</code> which write and read an <code>expr</code> to a file (respectively). This lets us leverage lean's already existing serialization facility (which is C++ and fast), and also avoids problems doing IO inside lean, especially manipulating char buffers which it turns out is very difficult and definitely hacky if you don't want to be slow (I've spent quite a lot of time trying to get this latter thing fast actually, but my attempts have been quite fruitless compared to just using the existing C++ code).</p>",
