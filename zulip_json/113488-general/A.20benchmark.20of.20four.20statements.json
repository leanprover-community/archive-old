For (1), I don't think we currently have such a nice syntax for integrals and infinite sums, but we can probably get close. (4) is something that I don't know anything about.</p>",

But the real subtlety (which I expect to happen also in Lean) is that the proof that consists of a chain of equalities like that in Coq wouldn't <em>mean</em> what Mathematicians usually think. In order for rewriting by a chain of equalities to be conveinient, it usually means setting things up so that it would say \"if the integral exists, then it is equal to that\", whereas  most mathematicians would probably read that chain of arguments as a claim about the existence of the integral as well</p>",

But there is one part that worries me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ideally, the system should be set up in such a way, that the mathematics that is formalized in it can survive a ‘redesign of the foundations’. Suppose that one builds a QED-like library on top of Coq, and then changes one’s mind and switches to a HOL-like system. Basically, this will mean that one will have to start from scratch. It seems very arrogant to think that we already know what the best foundations for our formal library should be, and one would therefore prefer not to be ‘locked in’ to a specific version of the foundations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think lean has a serious problem with \"lock-in\". The proof scripts in mathlib are all tied pretty tightly to the lean 3 setup, and lean 3 is a monolithic checker with no alternate implementations and no spec. Moreover, lean has already been through an upheaval once, from lean 2 -&gt; lean 3, and the library did not survive (to a first approximation). I think Lean dodged a bullet when it comes to foundational complexity - the situation is not optimal but at least soundness is not an open question.</p>\n<p>To me, the dream system is a Lean frontend on an MM0 backend.

I didn't see at the time how one could get a proof in Lean+AC that Con(Lean+AC) implies Con(Lean+AC+not CH) using flypitch the same way Cohen did for ZFC. However, I did think that it should be possible to rework the Boolean valued interpretation at the same level and that could possibly be used to give an interpretation of Lean+AC+not CH in Lean+AC, and therefore the relative consistency result.</p>",

Usually \"real mathematicians\" do not state their logic foundations in their work or talks; most of them do not even know much about it, except some vague ideas of set theory. Everybody assumes there is an informally stated but mostly agreed-upon common level where you can take functions, sets,  numbers and some other objects and manipulate as we are used to. And then logicians are supposed to know how this common level is encoded in term of everyone's favourite foundational theory.</p>\n<p>I think that what Wiedijk envisions in that paragraph is the identification and formal definition of this common level, and the encoding of a  higher level library exclusively in terms of this level, so that the logical foundation below can be swapped at one's desire without touching the upper part.</p>\n<p>I don't think I know any system organized in this way. In each system the artifacts of the underlying theory are visible at each level, and sometimes they are actively sought after, like all the advanced tricks with dependent types in Coq (and possibly in Lean too, but I do not know much beside very basic Lean).</p>\n<p>Metamath tries to avoid relying too much on how objects are encoded in terms of sets, but there is no watertight separation (there are some efforts, like the extensible structures logic). If the separation was watertight, most of the <a href=\"http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmtheorems237.html#mm23644b\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/mmtheorems237.html#mm23644b\">humour section</a> would not be possible.</p>",
