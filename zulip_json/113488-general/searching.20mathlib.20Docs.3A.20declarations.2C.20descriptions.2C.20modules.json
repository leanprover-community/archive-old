This improvement on the search box allows for a detailed exact-word-matching search through the names of the <em>declarations</em>, the name of the <em>modules</em> they are in, and the <em>descriptions</em> for each declaration, as it is found in the library itself as a comment next to the declaration tag and contents. Filtering is possible attributes and kind has also been added as well. Please check out the demo at <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs_demo/\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs_demo/</a><br>\nSome issues have been found and are being discussed in the PR: <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/doc-gen/pull/131\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/doc-gen/pull/131</a><br>\nFeel free to test it out and report any and all bugs and misses you find. The bugs will take highest priority for now :)</p>",
