However, any programming language that is turing complete, with unguarded recursion or infinite loops, corresponds to a logic that is inconsistent. This is fine because these logics aren't being used for proving things, and it doesn't mean that you can necessarily break the type system (of course, you might still be able to break the type system for other reasons, e.g. unchecked cast).</p>",
