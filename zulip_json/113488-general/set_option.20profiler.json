However, I do not really understand how to read the results.</p>\n<p>My understanding is that the tactic flags every time that one function call moves on to the next one.</p>\n<p>Should I be looking at large <em>differences</em> between percentages?  Are these differences really measuring how much time is spent on one of the computations?</p>\n<p>Is there some other funcionality that I can use to help understand where Lean is spending most of its time?</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
