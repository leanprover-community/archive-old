Most of it derives from things already in TPIL. Once I have survived the semester, I will work the material back in there. </p>\n<p>Another update: I finally moved PIL to Sphinx, though I have not yet changed the contents at all (so everything is outdated and broken). It's here: <a href=\"https://avigad.github.io/programming_in_lean/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://avigad.github.io/programming_in_lean/\">https://avigad.github.io/programming_in_lean/</a>. Simon and I will try to get it into better shape. I hope to use it with the class in a few weeks.</p>\n<p>Within the next couple of weeks, Mario and I need to start showing the class mathlib and showing them how to formalize \"real\" theorems. (Some will be more interested in writing little programs and proving things about their behavior.) I am a little anxious about that. We haven't yet figured out what to do, and I don't have good materials prepared. But we'll come up with something.</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_ref\"><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/m8r6bhu8m0zv012/AABOy6lv93pViN1-eZvHrmMpa?dl=0\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"itp_assignments\"><img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/static/images/spectrum-icons/generated/content/content-folder_dropbox-large.png\"></a><div><div class=\"message_inline_image_title\">itp_assignments</div><desc class=\"message_inline_image_desc\"></desc></div></div>",
