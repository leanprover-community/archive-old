I've got everything compiling. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110044\">@Chris Hughes</span>  and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110064\">@Kenny Lau</span> I know it's a pain for you to compile mathlib sometimes. Here is a link: <a href=\"http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/mathlib.tar\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/mathlib.tar\">mathlib.tar</a>  . I packed up mathlib (including all the .olean files) into a \"tarball\" (using POSIX tar so file timestamps should be to the nearest nanosecond or whatever). Q1 : can you untar this file back into a mathlib directory? And Q2: if you can, what are the timestamps like? For me, if I look in <code>src/topology</code> then I see <code>basic.lean</code> was created at 16:12 today and <code>basic.olean</code> at 16:49, so Lean knows that I didn't edit <code>basic.lean</code>after I created <code>basic.olean</code>. I took the tarball and untarred it on another unix computer and the timestamps survived. If by the time these files get to you the timestamps of <code>basic.lean</code> and <code>basic.olean</code> are \"the time it is now\", then the experiment has failed (do files have timestamps in Windows? I know nothing!) because Lean might decide it's time to recompile basic.lean anyway. But if the times are different then maybe this saves you some time compiling mathlib.</p>",
