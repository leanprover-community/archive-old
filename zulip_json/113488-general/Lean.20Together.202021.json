Who says we can't repeat it in pandemic times? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110031\">@Patrick Massot</span> and I are planning an online Lean Together 2021, the week of January 4. The exact dates and format are TBD, but mark that week on your calendars. We'll try to schedule things acceptably for various timezones, possibly starting at different times on different days. It's unlikely to be five full days.</p>\n<p>A few preliminary ideas: we'd love to see casual WIP talks from any and everybody who has WIP to share. Anything formalization-related is in scope. I think a big point of these workshops is to get an idea of what other people around the world are working on and to coordinate efforts. We're not only looking for polished conference talks, and we'd like to leave plenty of time for discussion. We'll invite some speakers from outside the Zulip world, and you should feel free to spread this invitation.</p>\n<p>Would you/your team/your research group possibly be interested in presenting something that week? Please let us know, either here or privately, with no commitment! Again, we hope for a mix of casual and more formal presentations, expecting more of the former.</p>",

I think we'll use wonder only because we don't fit in the free tier of gather and the functionality seems pretty equivalent. The sprites and maps in gather are fun but not worth figuring out how to pay for it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Besides the Christmas social (17 people), we also used it for another occasion (~25 people). Everything worked very well, the audio &amp; video quality was good. I think it works way better for mingling than having breakout rooms on some video conference system. </p>\n<p>There are 2 annoying things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The 15 person/circle limit I mentioned before -- we hit that one once when a guest wanted to show some pictures to everyone. In theory, there's a broadcasting feature, but that's for hosts only. One could send the password to that one guest, but then they need to figure out how to broadcast... and maybe some guests don't want to see the broadcast and continue talking, which is not possible... As you can see, it is not a good solution to circumvent the 15 people/circle restriction.</li>\n<li>There's a \"lock this circle\" feature at the top right of the window that some guests used by accident. It might be worth to give everyone a quick tour before sending out the meeting URL.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All in all, I think it works very well, but the 15 people/circle restriction can be annoying. Personally, I think that more than 15 people in one group for mingling doesn't make much sense in most cases anyway, but as noted above, there are some exceptions where it would be useful.</p>",
