I usually put these lemmas near the code that is using them, but sometimes I need the lemmas in other places and so I am wondering about how to best organize this. Ideally, I would have all these lemmas be part of mathlib. In fact, I already managed to get a bunch of them in mathlib, but some are not \"general\" enough for mathlib.</p>\n<p>Question: Where should I put these extra lemmas that are not part of the main theory? The best idea I have so far is to just make an <code>extras</code> module and dump the lemmas there. What do other people usually do?</p>",
