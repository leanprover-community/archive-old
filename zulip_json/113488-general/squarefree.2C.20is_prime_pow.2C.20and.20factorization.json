But in doing so I've found that <code>algebra/squarefree</code> imports <code>number_theory/divisors</code> and <code>algebra/is_prime_pow</code>, and the latter imports <code>data/nat/factorization</code>.  So I can't add an import of <code>squarefree</code> to <code>factorization</code> without generating an import cycle.</p>\n<p>Does this arrangement of imports seem right?  The definition of <code>squarefree</code> holds in an arbitrary monoid, so it seems strange to have this later in the import hierarchy than <code>data/nat/factorization</code>. </p>\n<p>Would it make sense to split out the <code>nat</code> specific parts of <code>algebra/squarefree</code> (about 500 of the file's 720 lines) into a new <code>data/nat/squarefree</code>?  Or is there a logic to the current sequence of dependencies that I'm not seeing?</p>",
