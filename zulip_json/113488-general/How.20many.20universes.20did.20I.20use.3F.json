In particular, I realised that the ZFC proof I knew that an affine scheme was a scheme \"took place entirely within Type\", by which I mean that every term I used was \"good\" -- here \"good\" is defined thus: (1) Type is good; (2) If X is a term of type Y and Y is good then X is good; (3) that's it. Once I realised this I went through a lot of files in my project that had lines of the form \"universes u v w\" and replaced them with \"universe u\", I also replaced many \"Type v\" and \"Type *\" with \"Type u\".</p>",
