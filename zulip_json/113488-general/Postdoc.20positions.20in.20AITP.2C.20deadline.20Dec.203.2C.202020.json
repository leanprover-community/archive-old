Someone posted a link to the CertRL paper a few days ago but I assumed, without even thinking about it, that it was from an another Vasily Pestun. I had no idea you were interested in formalized mathematics and programming (although I knew Coquand was meant to visit IHES last spring, he asked me to give a talk during a workshop that was cancelled because of Covid). It would be really nice to have formalized mathematics in IHES.</p>",
