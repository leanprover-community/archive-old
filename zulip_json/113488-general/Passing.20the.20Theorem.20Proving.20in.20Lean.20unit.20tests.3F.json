        "content": "<p>Hi all! I'm still fairly new to Lean and am working through the Theorem Proving in Lean book (currently on Chapter 5), but occasionally I've been running into things that don't work for me locally. As a sanity check, I went to try running the test suite for the book, but that also failed on my machine, so it seemed like just an issue with my local Lean setup. But when I tried running the tests in a Docker image built using the <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/debian_details.html\">Lean Community Ubuntu instructions</a>, I got exactly the same errors <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/3gLMBPJD\">(pasted here)</a>:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samestep/lean-docker/8846c6c/Dockerfile | docker build -t lean -\n$ docker run -it lean\n# git clone https://github.com/leanprover/theorem_proving_in_lean.git\n# cd theorem_proving_in_lean\n# make install-deps\n# make leantest\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Is there something wrong with my Lean setup (both locally and in the linked Dockerfile), or are these tests simply out of date? If the latter, would it be worthwhile if I submit a PR fixing the tests, and possibly adding some sort of CI setup to the repo for the book?</p>",
