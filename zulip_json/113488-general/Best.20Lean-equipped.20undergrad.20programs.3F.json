He is interested in pursuing math and computer science in university, and he really seems to enjoy Lean. I've been thinking of suggesting he try to go to Brown or Fordham to potentially work with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"260507\">@Heather Macbeth</span> or <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110596\">@Rob Lewis</span>. It occurred to me that it might be a good idea to ask here for recommendations for \"best Lean-friendly undergrad departments\". I mean, obviously, there's Kevin's group at Imperial, but I don't know if this student will be able to get to London. </p>\n<p>The answer to this is probably obvious...that one needs to look at the list of names on the right rather than departments. I thought I might test that assumption, though, before talking with the student this afternoon.</p>\n<p>Thank you, in advance, for your feedback!</p>",
