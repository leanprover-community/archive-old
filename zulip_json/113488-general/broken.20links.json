For this reason, \"Issues\" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by the pull_request key. Be aware that the id of a pull request returned from \"Issues\" endpoints will be an issue id. To find out the pull request id, use the \"List pull requests\" endpoint.</p>\n</blockquote>",
