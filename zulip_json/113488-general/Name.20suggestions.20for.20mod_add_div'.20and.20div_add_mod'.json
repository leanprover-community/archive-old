The basic question is to what the names of division with remainder should be (and how many of them should be there). There are four variations: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>r+bq</code>: This is currently called <code>mod_add_div</code>. (And before this PR existed for nat, pnat, int.)</li>\n<li><code>bq+r</code>: This is currently called <code>div_add_mod</code>. (And before this PR existed for euclidean_domain and ordinal.)</li>\n<li><code>qb+r</code>: This currently doesn't exist, but looks to me like the most common version one would find in a text book.</li>\n<li><code>r+qb</code> : This currently doesn't exist.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the issue, Scott just called the non-existing <code>div_add_mod</code> and <code>mod_add_div'</code>. In the PR review, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"310045\">@Eric Wieser</span> suggested renaming all of them taking the naming convention literally and adding a <code>mul</code>, so e.g. the first one would become <code>mod_add_mul_div</code>. What is your opinion? Should the missing two be added? Any opinion or suggestion on the name?</p>",
