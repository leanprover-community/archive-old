It worked beautifully. Many thanks. In fact, it worked so well that I decided to follow your further instructions to set up a Lean project with a local copy of mathlib, rather than using on a global copy, as I have done all along. The instructions again worked exactly as advertised.</p>\n<p>I have two small notes. The first is that, because I had already installed VSCode through the Ubuntu package manager (which in 18.04 is <code>snap</code> rather than <code>apt</code>), I ended up with two copies of VSCode. (I used <code>apt remove</code> to remove one.) Second, if I understand correctly, the appropriate way to update mathlib in my project is now to use <code>leanpkg upgrade</code> and then <code>mathlib-update</code>.  It might be helpful to say that in <code>project.md</code>.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for the excellent installation procedure and documentation!</p>",

It assumes that everybody uses <code>apt</code> or doesn't want automatic installation of anything. It seems Ubuntu created a mess with <code>snap</code>. But I'll add a simple test anyway.</p>",
