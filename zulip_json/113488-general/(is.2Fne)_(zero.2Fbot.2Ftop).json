This is agreed to be a good idea, but I wonder if we can deduplicate this code and reuse it in many different spaces: we already have <code>filter.ne_bot</code>, <code>discrete_topology</code>, and <code>ne_zero</code>, all of which mean one or more of the above in reasonable cases. I wonder if it's just worth defining them all at a go and leaving them to be used for whatever they are needed</p>",
