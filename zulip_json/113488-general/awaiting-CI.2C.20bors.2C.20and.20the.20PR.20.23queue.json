But other than that, it is ready to go. This means that other maintainers (or the author, after a <code>bors d+</code>) can merge the PR as soon as CI is ready.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PR <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/9478\">#9478</a> (which is on the queue) updates the bors configuration. After that PR, bors will refuse to merge a PR with the <code>awaiting-CI</code> label.</p>\n<p>Finally, the link <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3zVLgqR\">#queue</a> now points to a list of open PRs that are <code>awaiting-review</code>, but not <code>awaiting-CI</code>, not <code>blocked-by-another-PR</code>, do not have <code>merge-conflict</code> and no status failure.<br>\nIf you want maintainers to look at your PR, make sure that it shows up on that list!</p>",
