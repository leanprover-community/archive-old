E.g. if it's waiting for a widget rerender from the server, instead of dispatching another widget event request right away, enqueue it in memory. Then once the widget's rerendered, prune the queue to get rid of duplicate <code>onMouseEnter</code> events etc. <span aria-label=\"thinking\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f914\" role=\"img\" title=\"thinking\">:thinking:</span></p>",
