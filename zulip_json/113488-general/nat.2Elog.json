I always thought those computer scientists were funny defining nat.sqrt as floor of the correct sqrt, obviously this is just some random pathological function which is only ever going to be used in algorithms and not proper maths. But browsing through the API I noticed that in fact it formed a Galois connection with the squaring function so this does in some sense justify it, it's a right adjoint to the squaring function on nat. This I found pleasing but also a bit weird because like Yael observes when something isn't integral then who's to say that you shouldn't be taking the ceiling rather than the floor. However then I realized that ceiling of sqrt was the left adjoint to squaring :-) I guess the same thing is happening here. The algorithm people might have a preference though.</p>",
