But of course it's up to you. Do you also want to use mathlib? If you do then I really would recommend leanproject. If you don't (e.g. you're not doing maths and you don't need access to any of the mathlib tactics and can make do with the core Lean 3 tactics) then you can probably get away with installing a binary. Are you installing 3.4.2 (which has some buggy tactics) or 3.26.whatever (whatever the community version is nowadays)?</p>",

For me this is a narrow-minded approach but we've seen people before who are edgy about installing any more software than they absolutely need at this point in time. I can understand that some people might prefer this approach in general but as I've already said, it's not hard to find cases where people have just got stuck when trying this with lean for all manner of reasons and individual cases are hard to debug. Of course it is still possible to get working, presumably people were doing this before elan, but I showed up in 2017 and elan was already there so I used it</p>",
