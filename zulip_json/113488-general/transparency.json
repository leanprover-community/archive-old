In the reference manual I see that you can set <code>reducible</code>, <code>semireducible</code> and <code>irreducible</code> as attributes. My impression is that these attributes and settings are used when doing unification or matching. I can't find any documentation on what <em>exactly</em> these different transparency modes are changing about the unifier. Please could someone explain it to me or point me to some docs or C++ code that will help me understand what is going on here?</p>\n<p>So an example might be that you want <code>‚Ñù</code> to be irreducible because you rarely prove things about reals in terms of equivalence classes of cauchy sequences.</p>",
