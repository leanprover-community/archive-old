If they stay at the top of the file for 1 minute then you are compiling mathlib. If they quickly move from the top of the file and then spend 1 minute on your code then you are right, your hardware is not quick enough. The big question is what is going on during that 1 minute. You want to be compiling your code. I strongly suspect you are compiling a large chunk of mathlib due to a bad set-up. I'm sorry the infrastructure is not there. Ironically if you had tried to do all this a month or so ago before Lean 3.5.1 appeared and added to the confusion then you might have found things easier.

Then I think for cases like this, telling the user to run that command can be part of the debugging process (and maybe a final step in the setup instructions).</p>",
