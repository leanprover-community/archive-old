I recently updated Lean andmathlib from much older versions, and now I am experiencing the following behavior. The development gets stuck on a large file when I run <code>lean --make</code>, which is to say, the output freezes, the system monitor shows a cpu maxing out, and the fan keeps whirring. But when I open the file in VS Code, the yellow bars disappear after about a minute and everything looks o.k. I can step through the file and see the goals change in the infoview.</p>\n<p>Does anyone have any thoughts as to how I can debug, and what might explain the success of the lean server in contrast to lean from the command line? If I type <code>lean --help</code>, I see all kinds of options to increase various limits, but I have no idea what are reasonable numbers to type.</p>",

The file has a single theorem, a computer-generated proof of close to 500 lines, that uses <code>simp</code> and <code>norm_num</code> a lot to step through computations. Before <code>lean --make</code> freezes, the profiler reports that the elaborator succeeded in 78.3 seconds, so it seems that it is the kernel check that fails. (There is no smoking gun in the report from the profiler; it shows a lot of time spent in simp and norm_num, as expected.)</p>\n<p>The proof has a couple of calculations with 80-digit numbers, so there is plenty of room for the kernel to get lost. In the mathlib upgrade, I had to fix some problems that had to do with casts from nat to int to a field, so the problem may have to do with that. I will experiment.</p>\n<p>Is there anything to explain why the kernel check seems to work in VS Code but not from the command line?</p>",

There was a proof that passed the elaborator but led to a deterministic timeout in the kernel. VS Code compiled the later file without noticing the timeout (I guess the type signature was enough) and <code>lean --make</code> worked on parts in parallel, so it froze on the earlier dependency just after announcing the successful completion of the later one. Go figure.</p>\n<p>Second, the real problem was simply a numeric calculation with large nat numeral cast to int. If you are not careful (e.g. if you use the simplifier or force definitional reduction) Lean falls into unary notation.  Using the right <code>simp only</code> rules avoids that. I have gotten used to dealing with that, but this bit of code was written by a colleague who was not aware of the issue.</p>\n<p>Everything works great now. <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span> Thanks everyone for the help.</p>",
