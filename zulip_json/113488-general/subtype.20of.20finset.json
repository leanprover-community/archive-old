This isn't done automatically by coercions, as far as I know. I guess that for that reason he wrote <code>s.to_set</code>, after which the set is coerced to a type. I have written <code>{x // x \\in s}</code> before. But that is maybe also not a very canonical form.<br>\nIs there a canonical form? If not, what do people prefer?</p>",
