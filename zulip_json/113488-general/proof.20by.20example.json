I'd actually forgotten; the result that uses the Schwartz-Zippel lemma we actually give two proofs: one that it only true with probability 1-10^{-500}, and a more involved but unconditional proof. It's a bit of a strange paper, but is actually fairly self-contained if you skip the parts of the introduction that talk about pivotal categories. Besides that, it's just about planar trivalent graphs. (And, weirdly enough, makes use of grobner bases and elliptic curves along the way.)</p>",
