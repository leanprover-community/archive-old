I<br>\nam looking for an intern who would be interested in doing work at the<br>\nintersection of learning theory and formal verification.</p>\n<p>More specifically, we would attempt to formalize one or more<br>\nfundamental results from learning theory using the Coq proof<br>\nassistant. This would require formalizing concepts from probably<br>\napproximately correct learning. We would then attempt to prove one of<br>\nthe key theorems in learning theory such as the one that links finite<br>\nVC dimensions with PAC learnability or the one on boosting that shows<br>\nthat weak learners can be boosted into strong learners. Such work<br>\nwould build the foundations toward accountable machine learning<br>\nalgorithms where we can offer strong formal guarantees that a machine<br>\nlearning algorithm is behaving as advertised.</p>\n<p>I would really appreciate if you could share this short proposal with<br>\nyour students, and I would be happy to answer more questions.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This could be a summer internship for a PhD student, but the terms are flexible. Jean-Baptiste tells me that he has been considering Coq in part because of the existence of the MLCert project (<a href=\"http://ace.cs.ohio.edu/~gstewart/mlcert.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ace.cs.ohio.edu/~gstewart/mlcert.html\">http://ace.cs.ohio.edu/~gstewart/mlcert.html</a>), but he is open to considering alternatives, like Lean.</p>\n<p>If you are interested, you can e-mail him directly:</p>\n<p>Jean-Baptiste Tristan &lt;<a href=\"mailto:JEAN.BAPTISTE.TRISTAN@oracle.com\" title=\"mailto:JEAN.BAPTISTE.TRISTAN@oracle.com\">JEAN.BAPTISTE.TRISTAN@oracle.com</a>&gt; </p>\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\n<p>Jeremy</p>",
