        "content": "<p>I am still very new to lean but I have been browsing through mathlib these days. I would like to share one obstacle I observed that an ordinary mathematician would face when trying to understanding lean code. That is, <strong>abbreviation of mathematical terms</strong>.  For example, look at this definition of an outer measure:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span>structure outer_measure (Œ± : Type*) :=\n(measure_of : set Œ± ‚Üí ennreal)\n(empty : measure_of ‚àÖ = 0)\n(mono : ‚àÄ{s‚ÇÅ s‚ÇÇ}, s‚ÇÅ ‚äÜ s‚ÇÇ ‚Üí measure_of s‚ÇÅ ‚â§ measure_of s‚ÇÇ)\n(Union_nat : ‚àÄ(s:‚Ñï ‚Üí set Œ±), measure_of (‚ãÉi, s i) ‚â§ (‚àëi, measure_of (s i)))\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>In this case, since I am familiar with the definition, I can guess that ennreal = extented non-negative reals, mono=monotonicity, Union_nat= countable subadditivity. But others might get it. Moreover, sometimes the abbreviation is long and odd looking and it's hard to guess its meaning. I understand that abbreviation can shorten the code, but I would argue that in the statement of major definitions or theorems, it worthes avoiding abbreviation in order to increase the readability to ordinary mathematicians.</p>",

As you can see from the link, there is absolutely no context or even a docstring. Several suggestions have been made about how to make this definition more readily accessible to passing mathematicians. Not all of them are viable -- for example changing constructor names breaks code, and to a computer scientist (and this code was written by a computer scientist) there is nothing wrong with the names anyway -- in fact several of them are the canonical names for what they are doing. Mathematicians don't know this part of the story though. Adrian can only understand the definition because he has seen the definition in more mathematician-friendly places, e.g. a book, or Wikipedia or something -- something which was written to be read by humans. This code was not. However as a human myself, I did once try to learn what mathlib was all about by reading mathlib and I found it extremely difficult to get anywhere. In the end I learnt what it was about by taking mathematics I understood, like the definition of a scheme, and trying to write it in Lean. But we can do better in this instance.</p>\n<p>How would the maintainers feel about a small PR containing only comments about what was going on in this definition, and perhaps a reference to the literature or Wikipedia?</p>",

People's reluctance to use or learn something (lean in this case) is often emotional.

Following point 2. Newcomers of lean certainly do not install lean immediately, they will probably first poke around and look at mathlib through github.

I think that this is because the CS community has no idea what makes the maths community tick. The proof of the odd order theorem shows us that formal proof verifiers are capable of understanding several hundred pages of lemmas about group theory. This is a really useful data point for the CS people. But mathematicians don't care about the maths -- this is 50 years old and well-known, it is a major result in what is now regarded as a dead area. This is my question to the Coq community -- where are all the modern research level objects which get mathematicians excited? Where are the formalisations of the Millennium problems? Where are <em>schemes</em>? Where is all the stuff that research mathematicians are interested in? I looked and looked and I can find very little. In Lean we are doing things differently. The development of the maths library is now in general being done by people who have mathematical goals -- for example I want to formalise the global Langlands conjectures so am gently pushing people to do algebraic closure of fields, Galois theory, group cohomology, global fields etc. These things might just all be done in random places in Coq Contribs or whatever -- or maybe they're not even there at all. In fact I am certain that the Langlands conjectures are not there -- because this isn't the kind of thing that was getting done in Coq. I am not even sure there is a human alive on this planet who knows enough about Coq and enough about the Langlands conjectures to be able to even write the code. We are driving the Lean maths library project towards objects which <em>real mathematicians actually care about</em>. Once we have a large collection of these things, we will look completely different to Coq because our library will reflect a much more modern mathematics. So I reject the argument that says that history is not on our side.</p>",

When I can go round to the people in my department and say \"tell me a theorem / conjecture you're working on or thinking about\" and I have about a 50% chance of being able to formalise this theorem painlessly in Lean, that's when people are going to start listening. I have a clear path towards this -- get undergraduates formalising things like calculus and manifolds and basic stuff, and then get PhD students formalising harder stuff. This is where to start. The staff don't care and are stuck in their ways. The revolution is going to come from a very surprising source -- kids. Once we can actually state things like the Hodge Conjecture -- and it will only be a couple of years, believe you me -- and once we have a database of human-claimed theorems and can begin to make a database which can be used for search -- then they will come.

When I can go round to the people in my department and say \"tell me a theorem / conjecture you're working on or thinking about\" and I have about a 50% chance of being able to formalise this theorem painlessly in Lean, that's when people are going to start listening. I have a clear path towards this -- get undergraduates formalising things like calculus and manifolds and basic stuff, and then get PhD students formalising harder stuff. This is where to start. The staff don't care and are stuck in their ways. The revolution is going to come from a very surprising source -- kids. Once we can actually state things like the Hodge Conjecture -- and it will only be a couple of years, believe you me -- and once we have a database of human-claimed theorems and can begin to make a database which can be used for search -- then they will come. They're not here now because we have nothing to offer them yet.

We can get <code>p</code> by playing through our resource, where now the roles are reversed, which means we get to choose. Se we of course choose <code>p</code> and win this game. If F chooses <code>q</code> we similarly choose <code>q</code> from our hypotheses and thus we win the game regardless of what F chose.</p>\n<p>Why are the roles reversed when we play in the resource game? Well I have to confess I am not sure if I know how to explain it, but I can make a few observations:</p>\n<p>Classically A ‚Üí B is the same as ¬¨A ‚à® B, so an implies-game is a game where the Verifier gets to choose between playing the B-game or the reverse game of A.</p>\n<p>So in our example if we instead are proving (p ‚àß q) ‚Üí (q ‚àß p) which we kind of are, then this is a bigger game that is classically the ¬¨(p ‚àß q) ‚à® (q ‚àß p) game, and because we are at the disjunction-node, the Verifier can choose to play the reverse game ¬¨(p ‚àß q) which is just the game (p ‚àß q) with the roles reversed.
