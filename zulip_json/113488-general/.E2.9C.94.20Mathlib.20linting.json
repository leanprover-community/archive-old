If you have a copy of mathlib locally, then you can run them as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>add <code>#lint</code> somewhere in a Lean file. It will lint all the declarations above it, finding things like unused arguments, missing docstrings, bad simp-lemmas, etc.</li>\n<li>run <code>./scripts/lint-style.sh</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>About <code>#lint</code> there is one little catch. Some issues only show up once you look at multiple files together. That is why CI runs <code>#lint</code> in a new file that imports all of mathlib.</p>",
