Instead of tagging <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/finset.prod_comp\">docs#finset.prod_comp</a>, it was additivized by hand and later tagged <code>to_additive</code>. The later tagging adds a docstring, as shown by the source, but it seems to get ignored because it's not visible in the docs.</p>",
