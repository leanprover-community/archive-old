Having said that, I'd like to try to compile Lean with <code>MULTI_THREAD</code> off (where <code>MULTI_THREAD</code> is from <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/blob/4c40c41ccc0820a4896255efa4b180c9922d8125/src/CMakeLists.txt#L27\">this file</a>.)  That will make sure we don't set the <code>LEAN_MULTI_THREAD</code> flag, which forces some delays in the server.  I'd like to try running the lean server (from Python) without this flag so that I can see how it behaves.  Is it significantly faster, but still reliable?</p>\n<p>Anyway, how would I go about doing that?  Should I just clone lean, set <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/blob/4c40c41ccc0820a4896255efa4b180c9922d8125/src/CMakeLists.txt#L27\"><code>option(MULTI_THREAD \"MULTI_THREAD\" ON)</code></a> to <code>OFF</code>, and then compile from sources as normal?</p>",
