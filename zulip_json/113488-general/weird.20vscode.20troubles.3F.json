My guess is that this has to do with the different versions of Lean. I never updated my \"default\" Lean version, so maybe it's busy changing Lean to the version specified in <code>leanpkg.toml</code>.<br>\nI just tested:  opening a file that doesn't import anything from mathlib took about 1 second before starting to show yellow lines, but opening a file that imports all of mathlib took ~20 seconds before starting to show yellow lines.</p>",
