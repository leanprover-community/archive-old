The only ways I know to get the Lean 3 server to run code involve inserting code into the file it has loaded and then filtering the messages for output. So you could insert a <code>by library_search</code> at the beginning / end of the line that the cursor is on and then remove it after Lean returned the result. (There are hole-commands, too, but you have to have <code>{! !}</code> or <code>_</code> in the Lean code to be able to trigger those.) </p>\n<p>It'd be much nicer if we had a Lean server command for <code>#eval</code>ing or <code>run_cmd</code>ing at a certain point in a file...</p>",
