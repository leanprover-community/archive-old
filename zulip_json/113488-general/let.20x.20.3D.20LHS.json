I want to write \"now let x be the left hand side\" just to make things easier to handle, but the proof terms are probably nightmares. I am hoping there's a cute one-liner which lets me do this, based on the fact that I sometimes use <code>to_lhs</code> in conv mode. But I don't think <code>to_lhs</code> exists in tactic mode.</p>",
