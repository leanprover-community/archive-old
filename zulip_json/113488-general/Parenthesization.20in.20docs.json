For <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/real.rpow_mul\">docs#real.rpow_mul</a>, within Lean it shows <code>x ^ (y * z) = (x ^ y) ^ z</code>, but the docs show <code>x ^ y * z = (x ^ y) ^ z</code>, which is not correct. For <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/real.mul_self_sqrt\">docs#real.mul_self_sqrt</a>, within Lean it shows <code>real.sqrt x * real.sqrt x = x</code>, but the docs show <code>(real.sqrt x) * real.sqrt x = x</code>, which is ok but strange. Is this a known problem?</p>",
