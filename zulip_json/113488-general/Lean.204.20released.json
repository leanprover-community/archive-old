It seems to override <code>vscode-lean</code> in all Lean projects, so for now I've disabled it globally and enabled it only in this workspace.</p>\n<p>The extension should run when you open a <code>.lean</code> file and you can test the features mentioned in <a href=\"https://github.com/mhuisi/vscode-lean4#functionality\">the README</a>. For example, you can go through each of the files in <code>advent-of-lean-4</code> and make the (relatively straightforward) fixes to get it to work with 4.0.0-m1.</p>",
