Yesterday I created an interactive 15 puzzle.</p>\n<p>This is done in Lean with <code>system.io</code>, and a separate application in C# that accepts drawing commands via stdin. This way, Lean doesn't need to implement any window management, and supporting stdio is all that is required for Lean (or any other language) to create graphical applications.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/vBz6x5cVqeoq7s-qqIRcyzVG/3cd189ab-26e3-42d6-8a5b-b5647a606597.gif\">3cd189ab-26e3-42d6-8a5b-b5647a606597.gif</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/vBz6x5cVqeoq7s-qqIRcyzVG/3cd189ab-26e3-42d6-8a5b-b5647a606597.gif\" title=\"3cd189ab-26e3-42d6-8a5b-b5647a606597.gif\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/vBz6x5cVqeoq7s-qqIRcyzVG/3cd189ab-26e3-42d6-8a5b-b5647a606597.gif\"></a></div>",
