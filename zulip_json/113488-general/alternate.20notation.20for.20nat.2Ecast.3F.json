The important thing is that it's <em>not</em> a coercion, which can cause unpleasant surprises because it's a computationally very expensive operation. Also because it is not hooked into the coercion framework there is no question of transitivity searches for these instances, and taking these out of the coercion framework fixes the issue with forward searching for coercions.</p>",
