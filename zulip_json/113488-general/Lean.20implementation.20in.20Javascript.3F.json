I am planning to build a visual proof-assistant on an infinite canvas where lemmas becomes nodes of a graph and tactics/proofs become the edges. It's going to be challenging but at least I will end up learning a lot on the way.</p>\n<p>Because this will be web-based, I was wondering if someone has managed to implement Lean in browser-compatible Javascript. I am not very knowledgeable in C/C++, so I'd prefer a clean-room pure JS implementation, rather than those transpiled using Emscripten or WebAssembly.</p>\n<p>If a Javascript implementation of Lean isn't available, I'd be interested in writing one. Are there any resources to help a programmer implement a Lean-like language from scratch? My aim is to retain full compatibility so that entire mathlib could be imported as-is.</p>",

It currently goes till Simply typed Lambda Calculus which is quite a lot. There is even <a href=\"https://www.isa-afp.org/entries/Incredible_Proof_Machine.html\">an Isabelle proof that their port graph approach is as powerful as natural deduction</a>.</p>",
