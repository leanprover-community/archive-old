If there are advantages in using emacs over VS Code (like some minibuffer feature) then my opinion now is that someone should come up with a coherent way of porting them to VS Code and then perhaps we should try and persuade Gabriel to implement them in the VS Code Lean extension.

Basically we have to implement a <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#HoverProvider\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#HoverProvider\">\"HoverProvider\"</a> which returns \"Hover\" objects.

(You can see what vscode-lean currently does <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/blob/master/src/hover.ts\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/blob/master/src/hover.ts\">here</a>). Nonetheless, it does seem to be possible to put LaTeX inside the hover windows: see <a href=\"https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki/Hover#previewing-equations\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki/Hover#previewing-equations\">these screenshots</a> from the \"LaTeX-Workshop\" extension wiki. </p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"111038\">@Greg Langmead</span> It seems like what you want is a kind of \"rich text\" editor, where a single editor window would display both chunks of rendered markdown as well as bits of (interactively interpreted) Lean code. Leaving aside the details of any future \"Literate Lean\" format, let me expand on my comment from last night. I believe you could implement this in a VS Code extension but since VS Code doesn't currently let us customize the editor UI to that extent, you would have to write your own editor in a web view. I haven't dug too deep into vscode-python's Jupyter notebook support, but I am pretty sure that is what they do (probably using <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor\">monaco</a> in their webview). It looks like VS Code is in the process of adding <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/77131\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/77131\">a custom editor API</a> which would help such custom editors better integrate into VS Code (e.g. saving and undoing); note that this won't help with the \"front-end\" work that would need to be done.</p>\n<p>If you just want to be able to preview the markdown in module / docstring comments in Lean files while editing them in the usual editor, that would be a lot easier. There are two features that seem much easier to me (though I won't have time to tackle them in the near future):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The hover provider could detect whether the user is hovering over a module / docstring comment and then pop up a hover window with that comment rendered in markdown</li>\n<li>When the cursor is placed inside a comment, the infoview window could render that comment in markdown</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that there's also a fourth consumer of the comments here: <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@bryangingechen/github-lean-doc-preview\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://observablehq.com/@bryangingechen/github-lean-doc-preview\">https://observablehq.com/@bryangingechen/github-lean-doc-preview</a> (though I'm not sure how widely used this is). Possibly some of the comment parsing code there would be useful for the extension features I just described? Though for performance it would probably make more sense to edit Lean so that the Lean server tells us whether a certain position is inside a comment.</p>",
