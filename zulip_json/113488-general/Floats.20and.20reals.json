I know that we are all participating in a giant quest going far beyond individual contributions. But it would be really nice to find a way to pass around the history of this quest. Junyan, I'm not blaming you for anything, but I want to tell you that nothing  you see here would exist without Johannes Hölzl. He was contributing to mathlib before any mathematician joined. He is the one who started the <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/e9be2fa75faa22892937c275e27a91cd558cf8c0/src/topology/basic.lean#L2\">topology library</a>  and <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/commit/7882677de6cdb4f0044726054e16a535407256c0\">defined real numbers</a> (that definition was later replaced by another one, but it was used to start a lot of things). He was a strong advocate of (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/e9be2fa75faa22892937c275e27a91cd558cf8c0/src/order/complete_lattice.lean#L2\">complete</a>)<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/e9be2fa75faa22892937c275e27a91cd558cf8c0/src/order/lattice.lean#L2\">lattices</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/e9be2fa75faa22892937c275e27a91cd558cf8c0/src/order/galois_connection.lean#L2\">galois connections</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/order/filter/basic.lean#L2\">filters</a>. His views still have a very profound impact on today's mathlib, and will continue in mathlib4.</p>",
