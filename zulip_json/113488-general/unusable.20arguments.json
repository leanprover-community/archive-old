In order to apply this instance we need to assign <code>?x_3 := nat.succ</code>; I claim we should never assign a metavariable in this way (except in the presence of <code>out_param</code>).<br>\nIn general, a metavariable might be \"owned\" by something other than instance search and so it does not make sense for instance search to assign it. For example, it might be the type of an expression <code>e</code> in an application <code>e x</code>; we haven't elaborated <code>e</code> yet so we represent its type as a metavariable. In this case it is definitely not sensible for instance search to assign this metavariable (except in the presence of <code>out_param</code>, since this is its purpose).<br>\nNow, in the trace above, <code>?x_3</code> actually came from applying another instance, and so arguably it is \"owned\" by the instance search. This still seems dubious to me (and definitely breaks instance coherence), but it is better than assigning metavariables that existed prior to instance search. For example, if the type of <code>?x_0</code> contained a metavariable, it would definitely be wrong to assign it in the course of applying an instance.<br>\nIt's possible that the behavior is already \"instance selection never refines a metavariable that existed beforehand\".</p>",

Reid's criterion means that the <code>coe1 a ?b</code> is now stuck, but <code>coe_t ?b c</code> can make progress because <code>coe_t</code> has an out_param on its first argument, and once it is done  <code>coe1 a b</code>  can fire.</p>",
