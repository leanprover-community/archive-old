Would this be useful to people?</p>\n<p>If I were to take a stab at this, what would be the recommended way to develop? Should I build in an independent GitHub repo and discuss on Zulip? Does it make sense in mathlib (i.e. creating <code>src/pl_theory</code>, <code>src/rewriting</code>), and if so, are there any guidelines about structure? (Apologies if I'm missing something - don't have much experience contributing to Lean projects yet. <span aria-label=\"slight smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"slight smile\">:slight_smile:</span>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does anyone have thoughts on this?</p>",
