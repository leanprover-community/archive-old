        "content": "<p>This is a pretty general question. The first time I formalised something in Lean, I made fairly frequent use of logical connectives in my definitions, but after returning to do something else, I noticed that I could essentially eliminate all uses of disjunctions, conjunctions and existentials by  defining it inductively. For example, if I have a property <code>foo</code> in mind of objects <code>a</code> of type <code>A</code> which holds if <code>bar a</code> or <code>baz a</code>, my old instinct would be something like</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">def</span> <span class=\"n\">foo</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span> <span class=\"bp\">-&gt;</span> <span class=\"kt\">Prop</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">bar</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"bp\">∨</span> <span class=\"n\">baz</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>but now I tend to do something like this</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">inductive</span> <span class=\"n\">foo</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span> <span class=\"bp\">-&gt;</span> <span class=\"kt\">Prop</span>\n<span class=\"bp\">|</span> <span class=\"n\">foo.bar</span>  <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"o\">}</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">bar</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"bp\">-&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">foo</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span>\n<span class=\"bp\">|</span> <span class=\"n\">foo.baz</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"o\">}</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">baz</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"bp\">-&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">foo</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Similarly, I could define something using an existential, or I could do it inductively with the existential argument as an argument to the constructor. Conjunctions can also be removed by currying if they are a hypothesis to a constructor and by splitting into two constructors if it's a conclusion.</p>\n<p>Is this a well understood phenomena, and is there any important difference between these two different ways of defining things? I have an intuition that the difference between <code>| foo.bar {a} : (∃ b, bar a b) -&gt; foo a </code> and <code>| foo.bar {a} (b)  : bar a b -&gt; foo a </code> has some computability significance, though I'm not sure.</p>\n<p>I think I just picked up this habit implicitly from read other people's Lean code, and I have a feeling that this is the \"better\" way to define things in lean, and leads to cleaner tactic proofs, but I don't really know enough to confirm that.</p>",
