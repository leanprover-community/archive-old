Despite the fact that you can define suprema from infima and vice versa, there are Sup-lattice homs that are not complete lattice homs (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_lattice#Morphisms_of_complete_lattices\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_lattice#Morphisms_of_complete_lattices\">wiki</a>)</p>",

The paper constructs a HIT F that implies the existence of an uncountable regular cardinal; but ZFC gives scads of uncountable regular cardinals, like aleph_1. They argue that this gives additional power over ZF (which is true, since you can't prove that aleph_1 is regular without choice) but it's not clear to me how this relates to ZFC.</p>",
