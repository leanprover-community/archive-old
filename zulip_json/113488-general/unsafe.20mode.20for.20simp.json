In this mode it should apply some lemmas even if it can't prove all the prerequisites (and add new goals like <code>rw</code> does). Probably we need some syntax to mark those arguments that \"unsafe simp\" should assume to be true. </p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If I simplify an expression with division, then probably all assumptions \"denominator is nonzero\" hold true.</li>\n<li>If I argue about integrals, then most probably all functions are measurable and integrable.</li>\n<li>If I want to prove <code>continuous (f + g)</code>, then most probably I want to prove both <code>continuous f</code> and <code>continuous g</code>.</li>\n</ul>",
