Are things going well? I think I saw a bunch of tactics in the commit log on the rss stream. And the tactic framework was one of the bigger missing pieces that remained, right?<br>\nIf there's any gossip... I'm all ears</p>",

Moving the stdlib is next after that. This will make the actual Lean 4 language a reality instead of just a prototype used in a few select tests.</p>",
