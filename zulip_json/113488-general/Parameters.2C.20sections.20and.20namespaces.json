I know a bit about the Python side, but very little about the Lean side, so don't have much basis for comparison. CPython's bigint implementation is basic and simple (nothing like GMP), but it's well written and  does pretty well in practice provided you don't try to use hundred-thousand digit integers (which isn't really the target anyway). With one exception, complexities are the ones you'd expect from the usual school-taught algorithms: linear time for addition, subtraction, left and right shifts and other bitwise operations, quadratic time for division. Multiplication uses Karatsuba's algorithm when the number of bits gets large enough, so is subquadratic. (Disclaimer: I've done a bit of hacking on Python's bigint implementation over the years, so I'm biased.)</p>",
