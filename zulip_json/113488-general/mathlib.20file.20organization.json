For one thing, humans describe mathematics through language, and, as always, we need sharp words in order to articulate our ideas clearly. (For example, for a long time, I had some idea of the concept of diamonds. But only when I came up with a good name could I really start to think about it, let alone communicate it to others. Finding the name took several months (or even a year?). Then it took another two or three years to finally write down the correct definition (among many close variants). The essential difficulty in writing “Etale cohomology of diamonds” was (by far) not giving the proofs, but finding the definitions.) But even beyond mere language, we perceive mathematical nature through the lenses given by definitions, and it is critical that the definitions put the essential points into focus.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it is impossible to find the right definitions by pure thought; one needs to detect the correct problems where progress will require the isolation of a new key concept.”</p>\n</blockquote>",

Thus, when the definitions are interleaved with large chunks of theorems, I'm either flipping back and forth or viewing different parts of the same file in a split screen. Whereas with all (or as many as is reasonable) of the definitions in one file, I can view two files side-by-side, one with definitions and one with theorems involving those definitions.</p>\n<p>To summarize, while I think it would be nice to have a definition with a nearby associated group of theorems, I think that that is already problematic in mathlib in a very practical sense because the number of theorems generally surpasses the number of definitions and makes it difficult to find them. In addition to that, I think definition discovery is a useful part of learning a theory topic and would be aided by putting the definitions in one place.</p>",

I do not see the advantage of having definitions and theorems in separated files. Sometimes, the difference between a definition and a theorem is quite thin. Also, what makes me believe that an object in the library is what I am looking for is not only its name (and not even only its definition) but also the companion lemmas, examples, etc.  So it would not ease my inspection. Last, the definition of a list in Lean is probably no going to change, but for more complex objects, definitions often evolve during the course of the development. \"Testing\" the subsequent impact of the changes on notations, lemmas, theorem, etc. is easier if this content is not too far I would say. However, part of the answer might be of a technological nature. Even if I am flatted that people like <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110031\">@Patrick Massot</span> want to hear from my experience, you Lean people might benefit from tools that change the game.</p>",
