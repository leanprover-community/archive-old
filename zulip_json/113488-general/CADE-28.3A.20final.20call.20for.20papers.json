High-quality submissions on the general topic of automated<br>\ndeduction, including logical foundations, theory and principles, applications<br>\nin and beyond STEM, implementations, and the use/contribution of automated<br>\ndeduction in AI, are solicited. CADE-28 aims to present research that reflects<br>\nthe broad range of interesting and relevant topics in automated deduction.</p>\n<p>Important Dates</p>\n<p>Abstract deadline: 15 February 2021<br>\nSubmission deadline: 22 February 2021 (AoE, no extensions)<br>\nRebuttal phase: 29-31 March 2021<br>\nNotification: 9 April 2021<br>\nFinal version: 30 April 2021<br>\nConference: 12-15 July 2021</p>\n<p>Submissions can be made in two categories:</p>\n<p>Regular papers.

Reviewers<br>\nmay consider additional material in appendices, but submissions must be self-<br>\ncontained within the page limit.</p>\n<p>Short papers (including system descriptions, user experiences, domain models,<br>\netc.) Up to 10 pages in LNCS style.<br>\nSubmissions must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere.<br>\nThey will be judged on relevance, originality, significance, correctness, and<br>\nreadability. If software or data is relevant to a paper, a link that provides<br>\naccess to the software/data must be provided to enable reproduction of results.<br>\nThe review process will include a feedback/rebuttal period where authors will<br>\nhave the option to respond to reviewer comments. The PC chairs may solicit<br>\nfurther reviews after the rebuttal period.</p>\n<p>The proceedings of the conference will be published in the Springer LNCS/LNAI<br>\nseries.
