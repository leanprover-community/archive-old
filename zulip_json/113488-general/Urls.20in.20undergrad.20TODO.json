The idea is to clarify the intended meaning of some items, hoping this will helping improving the status of this list. <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/10415\">#10415</a> is a mathlib PR adding some urls in linear algebra. Hopefully it will be merged quickly so that people can see the effect of this new feature. Then everybody should feel free to add more urls (or replace mine with better ones,  I did that pretty quickly before leaving for a full teaching day).</p>",
