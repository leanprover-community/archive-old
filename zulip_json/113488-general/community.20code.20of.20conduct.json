GitHub has been <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/community\">reminding us</a> for a while that we don't have one. I think it's time to fix this.</p>\n<p>We propose adding the following text to the <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/meet.html\">community page</a> of the website. This is not in response to anything at all, and hopefully we never have to act on it! But I think it's good to establish this proactively. Suggestions are welcome.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Community guidelines</h2>\n<p>We are devoted to developing an open and accepting community<br>\nthat welcomes participation from everyone.<br>\nBehavior that is offensive, discriminatory, or aggressive<br>\nwill not be tolerated in any form.<br>\nWe adopt the <a href=\"https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/\">Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct</a>.<br>\nThese guidelines apply to the <br>\n<a href=\"\">Lean Zulip chat</a>Â <br>\nand the <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/\">leanprover-community GitHub organization</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"#maintainers\">maintainer team</a> enforces this code of conduct.<br>\nJeremy Avigad, Simon Hudon, and Anne Baanen serve as first points of contact<br>\nfor reporting any concerns.<br>\nWe also provide an <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdEjlFqJQV65F-yzRHl-lyWAt7TSUW1axPiQK3RyV67iu1h6Q/viewform\">anonymous form</a><br>\nto report incidents that violate the community guidelines.</p>\n<p>We encourage a policy of de-escalation in the presence of unwelcome behavior.<br>\nIf you perceive someone acting in a way that violates our code of conduct,<br>\nplease do not respond in the same way; instead, take action to correct the behavior,<br>\nsuch as reporting it to the moderators.</p>\n</blockquote>",
