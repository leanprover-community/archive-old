The idea is that <code>.gitignore</code> is for files and directories which should be ignored by all users of the repo, like .olean files, but <code>.git/info/exclude</code> is a local .gitignore for your clone only and you won't be faced with VS Code nagging you that you've updated .gitignore if you edit this.
