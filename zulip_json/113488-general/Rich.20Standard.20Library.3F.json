        "content": "<p>To give an indication of a few things that are in Lean that might be harder to find in other theorem provers, Lean currently has localisation of commutative rings at multiplicative sets (definitions and universal properties), affine schemes (and also general schemes, although essentially nothing is proved about them), and I'm working on formalising the definition of a perfectoid space at the minute with some others here. On the other hand there are certainly still gaps in Lean's maths library. I think Coq has some basic representation theory and as far as I know we have none of that in Lean. I hope we're not too far from some basic Galois theory but it's not there yet. I am running a summer project with a bunch of undergraduates from Imperial College London where we're formalising random parts of our undergraduate syllabus. It's completely directionless in the sense that the students can just choose to formalise what they like, and many are doing problem sheets from basic courses but some are putting new definitions into Lean. Some students are working on basic homotopy theory for example. I'm hoping we'll do some group cohomology at some point over the summer, and I think we'll get the fundamental group within the next couple of weeks. Is there anything particular you're looking for? Lean is only a couple of years old but it seems to me that the maths library is growing much faster and in more interesting directions than the other provers you mention. I could be wrong though -- I know far less about what is going on in the other provers than what is happening in Lean.</p>",
