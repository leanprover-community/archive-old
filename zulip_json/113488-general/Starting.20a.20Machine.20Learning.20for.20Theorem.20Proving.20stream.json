I'd like to make this discussion public.  It isn't 100% a Lean topic, but this is a great community and where most of the conversations have been happening.  How does the community feel if we start a Steam for Machine Learning for Theorem Proving (and if we spend a lot of time talking about HOList and similar systems)?</p>",
