Adapting the proofs was actually pretty straightforward once all the preliminaries were set up (thanks to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"246273\">@Bhavik Mehta</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"387244\">@Ya√´l Dillies</span>!), but I think this is the first big functional analysis theorem that we prove in a non-normed context, so I'd say it's a nice milestone!</p>\n<p>The next target in this direction is the general Banach-Steinhaus theorem, which is actually what motivated me to work on this generalization. This will allow us to get the uniform boundedness principle for distributions <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"412682\">@Moritz Doll</span></p>",
