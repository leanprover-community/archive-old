I maintained a \"computer algebra system\" called Magnus, which is a special area called Infinite Group Theory. It took a long time to \"come up to speed\" on the notation, not to mention the concepts they represent, and then the dance one has to do to input math into a computer. Once you spend a year on it, you'll find that Infinite Group Theory isn't THAT hard and the notation and jargon \"makes sense\". </p>\n<p>One of the key barriers, in my opinion, to wider adoption of computational mathematics is the \"impedence mismatch\" between what you know and what you have to type, that is, between your problem and your expression of your problem. It is quite a gap.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hales remarked in his talk in Pittsburgh last week that mathematical notation seems to fit very well with dependent type theory. Apparently we do know what we're doing, but just use exotic notation to express types for historical reasons.</p>",

Tony Hoare (<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/39256698\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://vimeo.com/39256698\">https://vimeo.com/39256698</a>) has made another \"Grand Challenge\" call, which in my mind, also involves Lean. Hoare says his Grand Challenge is targeted at software engineering and the science of programming. The challenge consists in the construction, evaluation, and deployment of a high level programming language compiler, one that verifies the correctness of each program that it compiles. In my mind, Lean has a central role in his Grand Challenge.</p>",
