In part, it is because of what <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"214703\">@Yury G. Kudryashov</span> mentions. But also, there is definitely the issue that there was no curation of the library, no 'gatekeeper' that suggested that things should build on one another. What happens is that different (but equivalent) definitions provide different levels of convenience in different contexts.</p>\n<p>But also, there is a definite first-mover effect: Mizar was first at so many things, slowing people down by requiring that they must build a coherent whole we it's unclear that the parts themselves are even possible, is/was simply too high a bar. Only in retrospect can we see that this led into chaos.</p>\n<p>Note that Coq has the same problem. They are trying to fix it, but it is difficult.</p>\n<p>The problems are well-known: <strong>none</strong> of the current theorem provers have good abstraction facilities. By 'abstraction' here I mean the CS structural version of that, as obviously most of them are happy quantifying over all sorts of stuff that are increasingly 'abstract' from a math POV. This is why we have the bundling/unbundling problems (save for Arend), that so much ink has been written about coerce and transport, that we need to care about 'definitional equality', proof (ir)relevance and so on.</p>\n<p>In other words, my opinion is that 'mathematics' as a _unified whole_ does not <strong>yet</strong> exist. And that it will be quite a bit of hard (potentially thankless) work to do so. Because, as others have said, mathematicians do know what they are doing, so it _will_ work.</p>",
