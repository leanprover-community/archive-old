        "content": "<p>9:05 PM</p>\n<p>To easy my own group's use of Lean (including onboarding of new students), I've put together a Lean in a Box environment so that no one will need to configure their own computers (beyond installing Docker and VSCode) to have a fully working Lean Development Environment. Simply create a fork of my repo, open that clone of yours in VSCode (in the right way), and all the rest builds itself. You'll be booted into Ubuntu 20.04 LTS running in a container with Lean and mathlib (among other things), delivered to you through a VSCode Window open and ready for development. I'd love to have a few people give it a go and send reports from the field. Detailed instructions are in the README: <a href=\"https://github.com/kevinsullivan/TMDE\">https://github.com/kevinsullivan/TMDE</a>. (TMDE stands unostentatiously for The (coolest) Mathematical Development Environment (ever). Humor for my students.)  Also, I I would not be surprised if others have done this before. I just wouldn't know about that, and so offer this as (another) opportunity to Get Lean Easy (TM) :-)</p>\n<p>[We are beta testing one issue here, so please be advised: If nothing really happens when you clone your repo into a container, please load the Remote-Containers extension for VSCode on your local machine, reload the VSCode Window, try again, and let us know. What <em>should</em> happen is that a Docker build process kicks off. You can open a window to monitor it at the lower right of the screen There's also a status bar that remains active while the build does. We might need to add \"Install the Remote-Containers extension in VSCode\" to our instructions.]</p>",

It is a distinct advantage of our design that one need <em>not</em> deal with WSL. The details are in the README. In our experience, Docker Desktop runs adequately on Windows 10 Professional, Enterprise, and Education machines, but not on Windows 10 Home (which is what most home PC users will have). But inexpensive upgrade keys are available. They're free to my students through UVa.</p>\n<p>And yes, the docker daemon does need to be running (typically through Docker Desktop) for some functions to work. So \"zero-configuration\" is really a slight marketing exaggeration. But give it a try, I think you'll be surprise how quickly you have your own GitHub-backed Lean project up and running with a first class configuration in all respects. Not free, but not bad!</p>",

We've added the clarifying instruction to ensure that Docker Desktop is running when VSCode is launched. We also fixed a small issue where VSCode would report a Lean Path not defined error. We fixed it by adding the automatic running of \"leanpkg configure\" to the set-up script. It all seems to be working now without a hitch.</p>",

I wasn't aware of that. Looks like a great way to dip ones toes in Lean water.</p>\n<p>I did, however, notice at the very bottom of the page that it says, \"The downside is you won't be able to create your own projects or easily upgrade Lean and mathlib. You'll need a regular install for this.\" </p>\n<p>Our containers build on the standard Ubuntu 20.04 LTS OS container with a full install of Lean. One ends up with a one-test-file project booted up through <em>leanpkg build.</em>  One can use leanpkg, leanproject, and all the other Lean infrastructure through a terminal to the container OS to manage, reconfigure, or update Lean, mathlib, etc. And (once you configure your git username and email in the container) you can push to and pull from your own GitHub repo as well as from the upstream one (this one!) to take advantage of improvements we might make. </p>\n<p>My aim was/is to provide a comprehensive, professional quality, but early-student-ready (as close to dead simple as possible)  development environment  and infrastructure.  It's maybe a little comparing apples and oranges in relation to the ZIP installers. Different problems different tools!</p>\n<p>Here's another use case: Our research software development environment \"inherits\" from this one but extends it with the Robot Operating System (ROS), a custom build of LLVM/Clang, VSCode extensions for that environment (e.g., lots for C++) and a bunch more stuff. It's no more complicated to get that environment up and running than the simple \"Lean\" one here, on the other hand.</p>",

It also works fine if you use \"Open Folder in Container\" instead of \"Clone Repository in Container Volume\".  I'm probably not the only who uses podman and runs into these issues though.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I looked at Podman. Thanks for that. I'd use it if I were building a containerized stack to run on Linux. It runs there and Docker Desktop doesn't. The problem for us is that it doesn't run on Windows or OSX.</p>",

        "content": "<p>\"Circling back\", I now have some data. A few weeks ago, I required my class of ~85 first and second year discrete math students in CS to obtain their Lean development environments for the semester using  the approach we've discussed here. I compared my observations of the  student experience \"getting Lean\" this year with experiences of prior years, when I had them follow the (evolving) standard installation instructions for MacOS and Windows. </p>\n<p>About 85% needed no help and had the system running quickly and without apparent complications. The remainder had various mostly minor issues. I have systematiclly documented each instance as a GitHub Issue  in our class repo (just in case you're interested, haha). Most issues were fixable in just a few minutes each. Since then, for at least the last few weeks, everything has been working without incidents, with the students working in the environment at least three times a week in class. </p>\n<p>Bottom line from my perspective? I've required students in large classes to use Lean and mathlib something like half a dozen times. For beginners in computing, with diverse laptop-based hardware and OS configurations, and variations in ability to follow instructions, and the need for prior knowledge of things like command line interfaces, the standard instructions are  too often too much. All I can tell you is that in my estimation, this approach reduced the overhead of getting students up and running by at least 80% versus the baseline. It was <em>much</em> easier for them, and consequently on me.</p>\n<p>A few of the issues that we fixed early on were raised by people here, so I'd like to thank each person who took  the time to have a look and comment here.</p>\n<p>(And if you haven't tried it and are interested, if you're like my students, you've got at least an 80% chance to see the fun part without any annoying glitches in the installation process. Would love to hear about your experiences, if any, positive or not, with responses here or issues in our GitHub repo.</p>\n<p>Kevin</p>",
