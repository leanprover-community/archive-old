        "content": "<p>There have been several people interested in talking to Lean from python. I needed it for <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/format_lean\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/format_lean\">format_lean</a>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"236489\">@Daniel Donnelly</span>  needed it for his diagram chasing project, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"115715\">@Jason Rute</span> wants it for AI, and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"251825\">@Frédéric Le Roux</span> wants it for teaching. So I decided to give it a slightly more serious shot. The resulting embryo is at <a href=\"https://github.com/PatrickMassot/lean-client-python\" title=\"https://github.com/PatrickMassot/lean-client-python\">https://github.com/PatrickMassot/lean-client-python</a>. The core part comes straight from the TypeScript client <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean-client-js/blob/master/lean-client-js-core/src/commands.ts\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean-client-js/blob/master/lean-client-js-core/src/commands.ts\">specification of requests and responses</a>. But this is only the trivial part translating back and forth between JSON and python objects. The tricky part is to handle asynchronous communication with Lean. Here the TypeScript client seems to be able to assume a somewhat uniform solution based on promises. I experimented with two opposite setups: Qt's signal/slot call-back hell and trio's async/await hell. </p>\n<p>There are demos of both approaches <a href=\"https://github.com/PatrickMassot/lean-client-python/tree/master/examples\" title=\"https://github.com/PatrickMassot/lean-client-python/tree/master/examples\">in the repository</a>. You can see the Qt thing in animated gif action in <a href=\"https://github.com/PatrickMassot/lean-client-python/blob/master/README.md\" title=\"https://github.com/PatrickMassot/lean-client-python/blob/master/README.md\">the README</a>. The trio demo does something similar to what <code>format_lean</code> needs, except that it's robust enough to avoid launching the Lean server with <code>-j0</code> flag (which asks Lean to use only one thread, hence drastically reducing asynchronicity).</p>\n<p>I'll probably port <code>format_lean</code> to use this at some point (but there is no hurry for me). I'll push this only if there is interest from the community. I hope this is already a good starting point for interested people (and it's what I promised Frédéric).</p>",

If I'm still waiting on information to come from the server, I will just send a dummy request.</li>\n<li>I was hoping for faster speeds for the \"sync\" requests, but there seems to be a 0.1 second delay (probably a sleep statement somewhere).  That put a bit of a damper on \"back-and-forth\" applications like sending a tactic to Lean, waiting on the response, and then sending a new tactic to Lean based on that.  Each loop takes 0.1 seconds or more even for trivial syncs.</li>\n<li>I never got parallelism working correctly.  If I wanted to sync two (or more) files at the same time, I had wait twice as long (about 0.2 seconds).  Also, if I started syncing a lot of separate filenames, then Lean's memory would blow up.  I either had to start the Lean server for each request (which has a fixed overhead) or I think I could \"zero-out\" a file by syncing it with an empty string.</li>\n</ul>",

It is difficult to be sure that \"sync\" hasn't finished processing (or worse is showing information from a previous \"sync\" request for the same filename).  As for \"info\" requests, they usually return the right information, but sometimes for large complicated files, they come back empty when they shouldn't or worse they are missing some but not all of the fields.  Also, sometimes there are multiple levels of information when tactic blocks are stacked and it isn't consistent on which level it shows.  I can give some examples if it helps.</li>\n<li>The output of the Lean server wasn't always as helpful as I'd like.

If I understands Patrick's lean-client, the one additionally thing it would give you is a way to automatically check that your proof is valid in Lean, but you could do that automatically by just writing it to a file and telling Lean to check that file.

For example, it doesn't return a state even though it should.  If so, how do you correct for it?</p>\n<p>In <code>format_lean</code>, where does the async help:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Does it speed up the lean server execution time to be able to do tasks in parallel?  (As I said above, that didn't seem to be the case for me.  If i sent two sync commands and waited for them both to return messages.  It would take the same time as if I sent one, waited, and then sent the other.  But I may have only been using one thread and that was the problem.)</li>\n<li>Does not blocking save significant wall clock time?  I imagine that most of the processing time of <code>format_lean</code> would be in  getting data from Lean via the server, so that most of the time would be waiting for Lean, even with async, but maybe I am mistaken.</li>\n<li>Is it just that it makes interacting with the server more natural? The Lean server has responses directly tied to a request (\"ok\" responses) and other responses which will appear at unpredictable times (e.g. \"all_messages\" responses).  As I said above, when I called a request, I would wait for the \"ok\" response associated with that request and then also record all the other responses into a queue.  If I wanted, say an \"all_message\" response not directly tied to a request, then I would repeatedly send dummy requests (e.g. \"info\" requests) waiting for the ok response each time until I got the \"all_messages\" response.  This is hacky, and possibly the largest advantage of an async framework is to avoid hacks like this.</li>\n<li>Does it prevent Lean from returning missing data.  I don't understand how servers like this work, but I noticed that I would get more complete information if I waited 0.1 seconds than say read from stdout immediately.  Somehow the lean server new I was trying to read from it.  Maybe by using async, I avoid prematurely asking Lean for data where it sends me incomplete data.</li>\n</ol>",

I've played only with sync and info requests, using only the tactic state information in info requests. Info requests do trigger empty responses when Lean is not ready because it's still compiling the file. Those empty responses are <code>CommandResponse</code> containing only the <code>InfoRequest</code>'s <code>seq_num</code> and \"ok\". In particular I couldn't detect a difference between this situation and situations where Lean simply has nothing to declare, for instance because you asked for information about an empty line outside a tactic proof. If you really want information about a file position, you need to wait until Lean is ready. There is no need to send dummy requests for this, you only need to listen carefully and take action when the time is ripe.</p>",

The <code>after</code> value won't start be computed until <code>before</code> is done being computed.)  (For another example, I also found that same error in your code--but you fixed it before I had a chance to tell you.)  I tried your new code and it works really well.  It seems to be much more robust than my code which is great!  I haven't found any cases so far where the server doesn't return results when it should, but I'd like to test it out more.
