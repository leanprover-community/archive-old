To be honest I would envisage it being done by either Johan or me, when we get round to it (it's not Patrick's speciality) , so I was really writing it for us. Another possibility is that a PhD student does it with me helping.</p>\n<p>I think there are issues here which will only become clearer once I start writing the lists. I don't want to do this today (I want to do real number game stuff) but I do want to do it.</p>",
