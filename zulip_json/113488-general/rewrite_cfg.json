Is it only me who missed this? I don't see anything about this in TPIL or the reference manual. I searched a bit and found: <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/library/init/meta/rewrite_tactic.lean#L11\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/library/init/meta/rewrite_tactic.lean#L11\">https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/library/init/meta/rewrite_tactic.lean#L11</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/library/init/meta/occurrences.lean\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/library/init/meta/occurrences.lean\">https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/library/init/meta/occurrences.lean</a>. So in case some terms appear several times, you can tell <code>rw</code> where you want to rewrite: everywhere (this is the default), only at a list of positions, everywhere except at a list of positions. There are two other parameters. <code>symm</code> presumably has to do with backward rewriting. Does it mean everything backward? Or try backward if forward doesn't work? We can experiment if nobody knows. And the last parameter is <code>md</code> which seem related to reducibility stuff.</p>",
