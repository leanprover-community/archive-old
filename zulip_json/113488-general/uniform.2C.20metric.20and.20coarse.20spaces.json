As coarse structures are \"dual\" to uniform structures, I am looking at the definition of uniform structures and adapting it. My problem comes when proving that metric spaces are examples of coarse spaces. In mathlib, the definition of a metric structure actually extends the definition of a uniform structure, with the justification that every metric space gives has a canonical uniform structure. The same phenomenon happens with coarse spaces: am I supposed to edit the mathlib definition of metric spaces so that it also extends my coarse spaces, or what is the best way to go about this?</p>",

The reason it's there with uniform spaces is a technical implementation issue to do with identifying products of metric spaces and products of topological spaces.</p>",
