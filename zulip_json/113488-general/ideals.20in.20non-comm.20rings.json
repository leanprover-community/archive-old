The annoying thing is that the most general conditions for the tensor product having a left action and having a right action are so asymmetric. There's one of the actions on <code>M</code> and <code>N</code> thats requirted to be a <code>distrib_mul_action</code> while the other one can be an arbitrary <code>has_scalar</code>, depending on whether it comes from <code>tensor_product.left_has_scalar</code> or from <code>tensor_product.right_has_scalar</code>, and these are of course not separate well in the current state of the file <span aria-label=\"tired\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f614\" role=\"img\" title=\"tired\">:tired:</span></p>",
