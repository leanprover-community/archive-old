The question is: should this be <code>hamming</code>, <code>hamming_dist</code> and <code>hamming_norm</code> instead?</p>\n<p>Secondly, the current location of <code>hamming.lean</code> is a new directory, <code>coding_theory</code>, so that this PR goes to <code>coding_theory/hamming</code>. Is this acceptable? If not, where should it go? The context is that I am working on other aspects of coding theory which, I hope, will eventually find their place here.</p>\n<p>Finally, in the event that we do have a new directory or subdirectory, should it be called <code>coding_theory</code>, or another name?</p>",
