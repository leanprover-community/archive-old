By default, it includes a ZIP file with a precompiled version of mathlib, which is ~36 MB. If you can get by with just the core libraries, then you can edit the script to change <code>library</code> to <code>libcore</code> to download a ~2 MB ZIP file instead. You can also customize things further by following the directions <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-web-editor#creating-a-customized-libraryzip\">here</a> to use the <code>mk_library.py</code> script.</p>",
