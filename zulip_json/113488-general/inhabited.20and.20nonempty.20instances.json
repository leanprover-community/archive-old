Inhabiting basic classes like that can create problems: for instance, if you inhabit <code>monoid</code>s by picking <code>1</code>, and <code>add_monoid</code>s by picking <code>0</code>, then a ring would be inhabited both by <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>, which can be bad. I would argue that, when there is a zero, it's always this one we should pick (although this is not completely obvious for groups with zeros).
