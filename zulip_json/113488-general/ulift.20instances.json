We had some structure <code>valuation (R : Type u)</code> which had a field <code>Gamma : Type v</code> except that Mario said that we'd run into trouble if we did it like that, so we went for <code>Gamma : Type u</code> and then, at his suggestion, spent some time writing code which given a valuation on R (type u) taking values in Gamma (Type v) produced an equivalent valuation taking values in some other Gamma' (Type u). The type <code>Spv R</code> was equivalence classes of valuations, so doing it all this way we were truly universe-polymorphic. However we never needed this extra polymorphism power.</p>\n<p>What I am however unclear about is exactly how much was saved. Because I think that even if we'd stuck to Gamma : Type u we would have had issues with equivalence relations on things that \"weren't sets\" (in my model of this stuff) and might well have had to write some sort of code to fix this anyway (assuming that we wanted everything to live in Type u)</p>",
