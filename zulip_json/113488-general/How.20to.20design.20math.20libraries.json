We'll need libraries that will allow us to represent things like vector, affine, and Euclidean spaces, including objects and transformations, tensors of various kinds, Minkowski spaces, etc. To our knowledge, such libraries don't yet exist.</p>\n<p>That leads to the question, what are the best practices for, and what are the most useful resources for informing, the design of mathematical libraries in Lean? Ideally we'd like to have what we produce have a life beyond our lab. I know that numerous of you on this list have been deeply involved in the development of math libraries for the Lean prover. Any informative discussion of what's involved principles, design guidelines, etc. would be much appreciated.</p>",

If no Lean project has had to solve the same problem, look at the Coq community or the Isabelle community or any other.</p>",
