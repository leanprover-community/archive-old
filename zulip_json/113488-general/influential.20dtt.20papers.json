I'd never heard of the concept before and IIRC it's dropped in without any explanation right in the middle of the preliminary discussion on type classes when, rather than talking about things like Haskell type classes (which I kind of understood) they start going on about making a canonical nat and then randomly dropping a proof that 1 isn't 2 using no_confusion. That was a part of TPIL that I had to read again and again before it made sense. I flagged this up to Jeremy who I think might have done some rearranging as a consequence...</p>",
