The \"proper\" way would be to write a <code>find_axioms</code> tactic. It should produce an <code>rb_lmap name name</code> that you can then use on the expression tree. There are subtleties in identifying which constants are \"really\" axioms -- you probably want to ignore things like recursors, inductive type constructors, etc. It would be easier if you know which constants you're looking for at the beginning.</p>",
