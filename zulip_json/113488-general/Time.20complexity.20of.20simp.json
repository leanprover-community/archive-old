In Lean (3 and 4), <code>simp</code> uses <code>reducible</code> transparency and by convention there are no <code>reducible</code> recursive definitions, which makes the matching tractable: basically, you normalise both the pattern expression (before you insert it into the discrimination tree) and the query expression (when you do the lookup).
