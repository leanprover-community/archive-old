        "content": "<p>This project has been neglected for a long time, so I decided to tidy it up a bit. The new versions are available at <a href=\"https://github.com/skbaek/qe/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/skbaek/qe/\">https://github.com/skbaek/qe/</a>. The main changes are :</p>\n<p>1. Now there are tactics for <code>nat</code>, although they are slower than <code>int</code> equivalents due to quantifiers added during translation<br>\n2. There are versions that use <code>znum</code> instead of <code>int</code> in the shadow syntax for optimization<br>\n3. Makes more use of typeclasses<br>\n4. Also includes a tactic for DLO without endpoints for <code>rat</code><br>\n5. The <code>leanpkg.toml</code> file is fixed, so you can install it using <code>leanpkg</code></p>\n<p>The main tactics are in the <code>main.lean</code> files of each directory. You can see the <code>tests.lean</code> files for examples of how they are used. As you might expect, <code>znum</code> is more efficient when handling large numbers, so there are examples which time out for <code>int</code>-based tactics but works with <code>znum</code>.</p>\n<p>3 and 4 were done just to show that the shared-framework approach is viable. The idea (from <a href=\"http://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/jar10.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow/pubs/jar10.pdf\">Tobias Nipkow</a>) is that QE-based FoL decision procedures mostly follow the same scheme, so the common part should be factored out using some module or typeclass system. Once this work is done, it is easy to cook up more decision procedures, since all you need to do is define (and prove soundness for) a single quantifier elimination step.</p>",
