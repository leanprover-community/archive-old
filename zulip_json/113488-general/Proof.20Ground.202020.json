What's with all the CS slant?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Well, Lean users were and still are welcome to submit problems. And I would imagine there was only one ‘mathematical’ problem because nobody submitted ‘mathematical’ problems. I think it might also be more difficult to find ones that are suitable for the competition setting. There are a lot of constraints: They have to be doable with the standard library of all three systems, they shouldn't be too difficult, but it also shouldn't be something that's so standard that it's already in a library somewhere.</p>\n<p>I also find it a bit strange that several people have said things like \"Lean = mathematical system, Isabelle = CS\" system. I don't see any indication for that. Isabelle has a huge amount of maths and quite a few people working on formalising maths in it. I was probably the only one of those active in the competition, but I think that's more an artefact of the competition (only a negligible fraction of the ITP community took part in it) and does not say anything about the systems themselves.</p>\n<p>The problem with the Lean version of the problems (which I haven't really looked into so I cannot comment on it) was unfortunate, but at the end of the day, that is the sort of thing that can only be reliably checked by Lean experts. For instance, you cannot expect people who have zero connection to Lean to make a sample solution in Lean.</p>\n<p>(By the way, the concurrency task also had some problems in Isabelle related to \"undefined\" processes being able to make steps, but it was still provable.)</p>\n<p>Oh and by the way, no, I am not an organiser. They're just my friends and colleagues and I think this thread has been a bit unfair towards them. If the Lean community feels that PG has an ‘anti-Lean’ slant, I suggest more people from the Lean community contribute and problems and sort out technical issues next time to correct that.</p>",

As we had four problems already in Isabelle and two in Coq, the workload for Lean apparently was too much. For the next edition we definitely will reserve more time for the translations and we invite you to take part in it!</p>",
