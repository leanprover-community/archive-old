First, is this for programming or theorem proving?  If programming, what kind of trees and why do you think there would be a standard library for trees.  Most languages don’t have trees or graphs in their std library.  If for theorem proving, most of that hasn’t been ported yet to lean 4, but the same questions remain: what kind of trees and for what use case?  I bet there is some work in various types of trees in mathlib for lean 3 which you can browse.</p>",
