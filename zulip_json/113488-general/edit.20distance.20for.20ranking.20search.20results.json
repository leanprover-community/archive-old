Say I know the lemma is called <code>add_is_o</code> but forgot the namespace, I want the search to return <code>asymptotics.is_O.add_is_o</code> (sixth hit atm).  Edit distance penalizes the missing namespace enormously, making <code>rel_iso</code> a better match.</li>\n<li>Similarly, I'm lazy and don't want to write the whole lemma name.  The search should give me reasonable results even if I just write a prefix.  If I want to know something about the union of dynkin systems, then <code>dynkunion</code> should help me out.  (four hits at the moment, all relevant)</li>\n<li>I really don't want the search to ignore my query.  If I type <code>eq</code> then I want something about equalities!  However e.g. <code>or</code> is only a distance of 2 away.  Similarly <code>mul</code> is closer to <code>add</code> than <code>addition</code> in edit distance.</li>\n</ul>",

The goals of the PR are certainly great!</p>\n<p>But I'm very concerned about the actual implementation.  As Eric noted, the performance is really problematic and I can confirm that it takes more than half a minute to start up on my laptop at 100% CPU.  The google search is more realistic than that.  (Then there's also some minor stuff like the javascript creating html by string concatenation, and further polishing like enabling line wrapping, making the search auto-update again, making the filter menu non-modal, etc.  But the performance is really the main issue here.)</p>\n<p>I don't think merging the PR in its current state will make the documentation more useful.  One realistic option might be to just take the changes to <code>print_docs.py</code> and <code>searchWorker.js</code> and hook them up to a new \"full search\" button.</p>\n<p>There are useful insights from the PR though.  For example, it is surprisingly cheap to ship more search information in addition to the declaration name.  The declaration list is 1 megabyte gzipped, if we add module names &amp; docstrings that's only 2 megabytes.  It might also be possible to add declaration types.</p>",
