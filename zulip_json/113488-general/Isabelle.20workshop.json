They surely will, however, provide good guidance for what seems to work and what probably does not in terms of indexing, relating concepts, search beyond keyword and term pattern matching, and so on for any community interested in these things.</p>\n<p>For example, the talk about the SErAPIS tool was quite interesting I'd say: they used Wikipedia articles to obtain keywords for concepts mentioned in Isabelle theory files so that users can search for phrases which are not explicitly mentioned in the theory document.</p>",
