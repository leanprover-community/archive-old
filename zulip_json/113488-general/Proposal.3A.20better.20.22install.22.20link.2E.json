I notice that for the macOS/Ubuntu install instructions, it's all bundled into a shell script so it's just a case of running a single command. So maybe overcomes the \"scariness\" factor of installing a Python package etc. I'm not as familiar with Windows batch files etc. but I wonder if we could get Windows to the same point (run one command and you're sorted) <span aria-label=\"thinking\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f914\" role=\"img\" title=\"thinking\">:thinking:</span> ?</p>",
