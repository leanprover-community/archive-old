This is sorely needed in many places, i.e. you can easily prove primality of 10 digit numbers using <code>#eval</code> but it is nearly impossible to use the decidable instance in the kernel. Obviously using <code>#eval</code> to prove things means that your trusted code base must include the entire compiler and associated things, but lean 4 is opening up the possibility of proving that all correct anyway, plus even an unverified computation is far more trustworthy than a human calculation, so I'm not particularly worried about inconsistency.</p>",

This has some obvious downsides though, since you can exploit these axioms to prove false things if you circumvent the tactic, i.e. it's not really checked for correctness. Doing this inside Lean would prevent the possibility for exploitation outside bugs in lean itself.</p>",
