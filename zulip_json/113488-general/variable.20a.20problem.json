They wrote <code>have Ht2 : (a &lt; nat.succ t) → (nat.succ t &lt; c) → (a &lt; c),</code> in the middle of a tactic proof, with a,t,c nats, and get a type mismatch error: <code>term a has type  nat.succ t &lt; c : Prop</code>. Chris tells me that this is because you can't use <code>have</code> in a tactic proof with an implies sign and a variable <code>a</code>. That sounds like a bug to me. Is it officially not a bug though?</p>",
