In case it's of use I've put it up here: <a href=\"https://github.com/danielbush/lean-remote-containers\">https://github.com/danielbush/lean-remote-containers</a> .  Basically you get a self-contained virtualized lean environment (using debian linux) attached to your vscode.  vscode effectively builds and installs lean for you via docker.  Haven't really tested using lean this way in anger though.<br>\nAnyway, love this project.<br>\nHappy new year everyone!<br>\nDaniel</p>",
