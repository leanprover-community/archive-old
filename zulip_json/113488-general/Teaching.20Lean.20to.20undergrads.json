Some options: (1) In the introduction to proof course that every math major must take at every university, the instructor could just refer students to the natural numbers game, without changing the course content. Instructors might want to track students' progress which would require accounts--is this a possibility? (I could help.) In any case, the game could benefit from a hall of fame, or its material could be added to codewars which has inadequate coverage of Lean.  (2) The instructor could offer students the option of completing Lean exercises for each proof that is already taught in the existing curriculum (see for instance the existing UMD course <a href=\"https://www-math.umd.edu/undergraduate/departmental-course-pages/offered-courses/378-math-310-introduction-to-analysis.html\">https://www-math.umd.edu/undergraduate/departmental-course-pages/offered-courses/378-math-310-introduction-to-analysis.html</a>). This would require the instructor or an assistant to get up to speed on Lean and create Lean files for each proof. Is there a cookbook for this and are there examples for instance at Imperial or CMU? (3) As a third option, the instructor could revise the syllabus in line with the CMU course as described in <a href=\"https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/Papers/learning_logic_and_proof.pdf\">https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/Papers/learning_logic_and_proof.pdf</a> and <a href=\"https://leanprover.github.io/logic_and_proof/\">https://leanprover.github.io/logic_and_proof/</a>, or make those supplementary textbooks. This seems like an excellent course--do CMU math majors have to take it? (4) Finally, enthusiasts could form a club like Xena.</p>\n<p>Here are links to UMD recordings for you <a href=\"https://umd.zoom.us/rec/share/J0hZUClJC0mHMEWqc51WvA7muI_8Imf3Y7BxoiUNbcJ-Lt1GIlUjBq5uT3RGiHKU.h3c7Dc1TxUbvlVH-\">https://umd.zoom.us/rec/share/J0hZUClJC0mHMEWqc51WvA7muI_8Imf3Y7BxoiUNbcJ-Lt1GIlUjBq5uT3RGiHKU.h3c7Dc1TxUbvlVH-</a> and and Mario <a href=\"https://umd.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=cba3dd82-1842-4b9f-a0a1-ad1601444ba4\">https://umd.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=cba3dd82-1842-4b9f-a0a1-ad1601444ba4</a></p>",
