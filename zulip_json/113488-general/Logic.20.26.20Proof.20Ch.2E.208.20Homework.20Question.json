The question is: \"Give a natural deduction proof of  <code>∀x B(x)</code> from hypotheses <code>∀x (A(x) ∨ B(x))</code>, and <code>∀y ¬A(y)</code>. My thoughts were to proof B(x) by contradiction, because by doing so, I get to assume <code>¬ B(x)</code>, and from <code>¬ B(x)</code> and my other assumption ∀y ¬A(y)<code>, I can derive, through De Morgan's laws </code>¬ (A(x) ∨ B(x))`, which should be enough to get the contradiction. Could someone check my proof in the attached picture and perhaps provide feedback? I'd really appreciate it! <a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/slZZR_2-sBUFMJWCov02sMrN/IMG-1413.JPG\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"IMG-1413.JPG\">IMG-1413.JPG</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/slZZR_2-sBUFMJWCov02sMrN/IMG-1413.JPG\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"IMG-1413.JPG\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/slZZR_2-sBUFMJWCov02sMrN/IMG-1413.JPG\"></a></div>",
