This occured when I wanted to add <a href=\"https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0063\">generalizing maps</a> as <code>_root_.generalizing</code>. They suggested that we should move all predicates on maps between topological spaces  into a namespace (perhaps <code>topological_space</code> or <code>topology</code>?), which I agree would be better. What do people think?</p>",
