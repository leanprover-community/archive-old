Also it give StackExchange a look at the community to decide if they should close the site down before making the beta public. So just jump in and take a look. Also questions asked during this period tend to get lots of votes and sometimes never get dethroned, e.g. the <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/prolog?sort=votes\">Prolog</a> tag has quite a few such questions from the early days.</p>\n<p>HTH</p>",
