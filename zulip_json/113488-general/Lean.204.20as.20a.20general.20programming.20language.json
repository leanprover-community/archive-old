Rust is quite similar to Lean 4 in a few regards that make integration more feasible: safe, high-level and functional-ish APIs (no OOP, avoids mutable aliasing), yet no tracing GC. And thanks to reference counting, we can at least check for linearity at run time if not statically. Not sure when I'll get to working on that though... :) .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Oh, do you plan to be able to call Rust functions and use Rust types directly in Lean? That sounds pretty awesome. <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",

It's not \"general purpose\" since we are building a <a href=\"https://github.com/GaloisInc/reopt-vcg\">verification tool</a>, but as part of that we have an x86 semantics, bindings to LLVM, SMTLIB generation, and an Elf parsing library.<br>\nI don't really see any reason you can't use Lean 4 as a general purpose language if you want to build native binaries (as opposed to webapps, etc).  It's also relatively easy to write bindings to C libraries.  The language is still in development, and I'd still recommend the vast majority of people use Lean 3 or a more mature language for now.<br>\nPerformance has generally been quite good.   I sometimes have to be careful about inadvertently blowing up the stack in code that would be fine in Haskell, but that can be fixed by refactoring.  The compiled code is generally quite efficient otherwise. <br>\nI think the community will develop when Lean 4 is released; I haven't yet used this myself, but it certainly seems like the metaprogramming facilities will allow the community to extend Lean in many different ways without needing to contribute to the Lean 4 core.</p>",
