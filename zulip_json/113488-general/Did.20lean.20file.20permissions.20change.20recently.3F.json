        "content": "<p>Did the <code>.lean</code> file permissions change recently for the lean files in the core library?  They used to be \"-rw-r--r--\", but I think they are now \"-r--r--r--\".  (In other words, you can know longer modify the files.)  I think this is good because I've accidentally modified such files in the past (and I think it would make sense to do the same for the mathlib <code>.lean</code> files in <code>_target</code>).  However, it also breaks some hacky proof recording stuff I made for lean-gptf.  That isn't a big deal.  I'll fix it.  I just want to understand what is going on here. <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span>.</p>",
