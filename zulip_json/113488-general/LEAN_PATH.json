But it looks like it doesn't use the olean in this case (at least it starts eating up 380% CPU). I tried typing: <code>LEAN_PATH=\"/home/pmassot/.elan/toolchains/3.4.1/lib/lean/library/:/home/pmassot/lean/perfectoid-spaces/_target/deps/mathlib/:.\" lean t2.lean</code> in order to use the (compiled) mathlib that I have in the perfectoid project to execute <code>t2.lean</code> (which is a tiny test file).</p>",
