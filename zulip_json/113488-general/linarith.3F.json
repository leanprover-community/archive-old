I was thinking about this in the context of the relatively new tactic <code>linear_combination</code>. It seems to me that just as <code>linear_combination</code> proves an equality by way of a formal sum of known equalities, <code>linarith</code> proves an inequality as a formal sum of known inequalities. What would it take to add a <code>linarith?</code> tactic that outputs a <code>try this : linear_combination ...</code> call? Is <code>linear_combination</code> designed to work with inequalities? If not, could it be modified to do so?</p>",
