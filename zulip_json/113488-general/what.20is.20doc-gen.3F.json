Am I right in thinking that if an undergraduate were to host a public Lean repository on github containing a Lean file <code>foo.lean</code> then I can perform some magic which creates <code>foo.html</code>? If this is the case then I can simply ask for submissions as pure <code>.lean</code> files without any corresponding <code>.pdf</code> or <code>.md</code> file and I can mark both the Lean file and the html file.</p>",

But will give you a general programmers answer.</p>\n<p>In the land of programming, programmers tend to be like sports teams and cheer on their favorite programming language.  As such for each programming language they tend to redo the efforts again and again as they transition to each new language. This gives us all of these wonderful different tools that work great for one programming language but are so customized at times they only work for the one programming language. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment\">IDE</a>s, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_build_automation_software\">build tools</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_debuggers\">debuggers</a>, etc. are such tools and even <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_documentation_generators\">documentation generators</a>.</p>\n<p>Looking at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_documentation_generators\">comparison of documentation generators</a> one sees that they are capable of taking in a specific programming language and depending upon the tool capable of generating documentation in various output formats including as you ask PDF,  markdown or as HTML files that contain hyperlinks. Some really nice ones will even create graphs showing the relationships.</p>\n<p>However many of these tools rely on what are called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comment_(computer_programming)\">documentation comments</a> (<a href=\"https://leanprover.github.io/reference/lexical_structure.html#doc-comments\">Lean doc comment syntax</a>) as opposed to source code comments. These documentation comments are the basis of the generated document and must be entered into the source code for the documentation generator to produce meaningful documentation. Often plain old source code comments are ignored by the documentation generator .</p>\n<p>So just getting a lean file may not be enough for what you seek. The author of the code would need to also add the documentation comments.</p>",
