I see in Reid's PR: <code>obtain ⟨c, hc₁, hc₂⟩ : ∃ c : α, a &lt; c ∧ c &lt; b := dense h,</code> which is the traditional way to use <code>obtain</code> to make proofs more readable. Somewhat recently, Mario extend the parsing so that we can put type annotations in <code>rcases</code>/<code>rintros</code>/<code>obtain</code>. Should we switch to <code>obtain ⟨c : α, hc₁ : a &lt; c, hc₂ : c &lt; b⟩ := dense h,</code>? I don't have a strong opinion here. The first version is nice because the existential quantifier is explicit, the second version makes it clearer what we indeed obtain.</p>",
