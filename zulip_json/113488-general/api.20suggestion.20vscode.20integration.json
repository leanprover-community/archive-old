It was specialized on minif2f problems (which probably aren't of interest to most of you here) and trained on an old mathlib commit, hopefully most theorems are still relevant ... </p>\n<p>If you want to develop your own suggestion API, interaction is pretty simple. API key is given in the x-api-key header, then : </p>\n<ul>\n<li>receive {\"tactic_state\": \"some_string\", \"prefix\": \"some_other_string\"}</li>\n<li>answer {\"tactic_infos\":  List[{\"tactic\": \"some_string\"}]}</li>\n</ul>",
