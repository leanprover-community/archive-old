A quick grep suggests that <code>nat_ne_top</code> is used 12 times (explicitly) but <code>coe_nat_ne_top</code> is used 8 times. Of course, who knows how many times the former is used inside <code>simp</code>.  So, I would keep <code>nat_ne_top</code> as is, delete <code>coe_nat_ne_top</code>, and replace uses of the latter with the former. Reasoning:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The name doesn't need <code>coe</code> because it's clear from context (we're in <code>ennreal</code> namespace after all), and this does parallel some lemmas elsewhere in the file.</li>\n<li>When used as a rewrite lemma, if the explicit argument can be inferred, then it will be. If you need to provide the argument, you can do so without <code>@</code>.</li>\n</ol>",
