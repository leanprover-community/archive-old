After some time staring at trace outputs and seeing exactly what <code>by apply_instance</code> could do, I managed to discover that I had managed to construct a ring <code>B</code> for which the type class inference structure could construct an instance of <code>comm_ring B</code> but not an instance of <code>ring B</code> (this was where the timeout occurred). The ring B was a \"normal mathematical ring\" -- it was a quotient of a subring of a field -- but the debugging was troublesome and the traces were gigantic and terrifying. I fixed the problem by giving <code>comm_ring.to_ring</code> a local priority of 1000 (this was the smallest number that worked). Looking at the traces, it really hit home what a phenomenally difficult job Lean has trying to solve these problems, but it was equally absolutely clear that the vast majority of what it was trying was really crazy. I just wanted to put my hands on Lean's shoulders and say \"we are doing abstract ring theory here, stop thinking about int.ring and all these other silly ideas\". Here, the issue didn't seem so much to be the loops in the inference graph but simply that it was so darn big and it was hard to highlight the manifestly important part of it.</p>",
