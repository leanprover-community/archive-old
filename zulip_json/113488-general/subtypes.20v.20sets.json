Probably what you're saying is that if I'd tried it, it would have unfolded into what I actually used. More and more I am deciding not to use coercions or type classes because I realise that rather than using them and then struggling later it is easier for me to just do all the work myself. I guess what I'm saying is that initially things like coercions and the type class system were complete mysteries to me and I could see them working in simple cases and failing in more complex ones and didn't really understand enough to know how to make them work for me. Now I've decided to do all coercions myself, and of course now I understand what's going on much better. The next phrase will be me attempting to use these tools again, but this time knowing how to use them properly.</p>",
