You can do what the heck you like with <code>fin n</code> as far as I am concerned, but for me this coercion is going too far. The whole point of <code>zmod n</code> is that it's supposed to be a mathematically meaningful ring, as opposed to <code>fin n</code> which is just accruing random structure and is in some sense beyond hope. What is the justification for this coercion?</p>",
