Both directions (not using partial function / using tactic synthesis) help practically. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"306601\">@Kyle Miller</span> May I ask what is exactly meant for 'unification'? My guess is that it is a process of deriving what is equal to what from the assumption that two things are equal, like from <code>f a 3 = f 4 b</code>we infer <code>a=4</code> and <code>3=b</code>. Also, I wonder if such tactic synthesis is also possible in lean4 - I'll defer this question to lean4 if needed.</p>",
