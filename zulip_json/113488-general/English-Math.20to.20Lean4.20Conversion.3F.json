If you download Isabelle, it comes with Naproche and example documents in Naproche, so you can get a feeling of what it is able to do.

(We are having enough trouble translating idomatically between Lean 3 and Lean 4.)</li>\n<li>If you are talking about mathematical textbooks, one has to not only translate the theorem and proof, but also all the definitions (or figure out what definitions in Lean are equivalent).  This makes it very different from natural language machine translation.</li>\n</ul>",
