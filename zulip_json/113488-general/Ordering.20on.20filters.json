        "content": "<p>In the mathematical literature it seems to be common to not let the entire power set be a filter either. But there are conventions here and this order does stick to the conventions. The type of topological space structures on a fixed type is also ordered \"backwards\" if you think about a topology as being a collection of open sets. But this is not the only way to think about a topology. There seems to be a general principle in mathlib that <code>a ≤ b</code> means \"there's a map from <code>a</code> to <code>b</code> or some kind of idea of that form. So for example with topological spaces T1&lt;=T2 means that the identity function from (X,T1) to (X,T2) is continuous, which means that T1 has more sets than T2. Similarly for filters F1&lt;=F2 means that the predicate <code>tendsto id F1 F2</code> is true, ie F1 tends to F2 along the identity map. Thinking about filters like this took some getting used to for me but now I think that it's a good idea because it better encapsulates the \"meaning\" of a filter than the naive approach. We don't think of a topology as a collection of open sets whten though that's what the formal definition is. If you buy into this \"a&lt;=b if there's a map from a to b\" idea then you can see that the more open sets there are, the easier it is to map out of, so it makes some kind of sense. Similarly I now think that this is a good way to think about filters, eg the neighborhood filter of a point can fruitfully be thought of as an infinitesimal neighborhood of the point which turns out to be a powerful picture in topology, for example it makes it intuitively obvious that a function is continuous iff infinitesimal neighbourhoods in the source tend to infinitesimal neighbourhoods in the target rather than getting ripped apart as they would be for discontinuous functions. Perhaps you could say that this point of view was a geometric one, and perhaps it's not surprising that this is the viewpoint here because topology is all done using filters in mathlib</p>",
