Now I understand <code>simp</code> much better and feel like the docs do a very poor job of explaining the \"point\" of <code>simp</code> -- for example they do not even mention <code>simp</code> normal form (something I probably didn't understand when I wrote the md file). I just went to edit this file but I now find that it's moved to <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/extras/simp.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/extras/simp.html</a> . How do I edit it now?</p>",
