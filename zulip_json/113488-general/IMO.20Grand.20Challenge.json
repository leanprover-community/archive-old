However I've been thinking about it more and more recently, we formalised some IMO solutions in a thread herehere and some were very straightforward, there is already an algorithm in Coq for solving geometry problems, and so on. Many Olympiad inequality proofs are very short and ingenious, and Daniel Selsam has suggested to me that they will be accessible to machine learning attacks, and whilst gold is a very very lofty ambition or would not surprise me at all if some lean tactic could get the occasional question out, and that's where these things start.</p>",
