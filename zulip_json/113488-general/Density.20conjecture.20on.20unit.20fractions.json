The project can be found here: <a href=\"https://b-mehta.github.io/unit-fractions/\">https://b-mehta.github.io/unit-fractions/</a>. Here are some of the reasons I'm really excited about this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some of the prerequisites for the paper are things that I first learnt from Thomas' Part III course at Cambridge!</li>\n<li>The result is pretty understandable: any dense set of integers contains distinct integers whose reciprocals sum to 1, but also a very recent piece of mathematics, and involves stuff from number theory, combinatorics and analysis</li>\n<li>This is the first formalisation project I'm aware of where the author of the paper is actively involved in writing the formalisation: the majority of the theorem statements which are &lt;= 3 away from the main results on <a href=\"https://b-mehta.github.io/unit-fractions/blueprint/dep_graph.html\">the blueprint (log_density_theorem and density_theorem)</a> were written by Thomas!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please let one of us know if you'd like to help out! For the moment, I think it should be a small enough project not to warrant a separate stream, but perhaps that will change.</p>",

That's really a unique story and shows what can be done right now. I really hope you guys can get the proof formalised!</p>",

And this was finished before the referee report on the paper proving it has been returned! <br>\nAlong the way, we used the Hardy-Littlewood circle method, which hasn't been verified in any formal proof before (to the best of my knowledge), and formalised a ton of analytic number theory (most of the first section of the <a href=\"https://github.com/b-mehta/maths-notes/blob/master/iii/lent/analytic_number_theory.pdf\">Part III analytic number theory course</a>), plus some tighter estimates such as Wigert's theorem here: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor_function#Growth_rate\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor_function#Growth_rate</a>.  Plus, we think this is the first one of Erdős' prize conjectures to have a formalised solution!<br>\nThe process made me learn a lot more about how filters and integration work in Lean, but I think what's really exciting about this is that a huge portion of the formalisation was done by Thomas himself, who knew absolutely no Lean 6 months ago.</p>",
