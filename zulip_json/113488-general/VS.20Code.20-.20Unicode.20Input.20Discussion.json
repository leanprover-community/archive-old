I often type <code>\\&lt;-</code>, <code>\\-&gt;</code> and <code>\\&lt;-&gt;</code>. Unfortunately, there is <code>\\&lt;-n</code>, <code>\\-&gt;n</code> and <code>\\&lt;-&gt;n</code> which makes those abbreviations not-prefix-free.<br>\nI can imagine two fixes for that:<br>\n1.1) When <code>\\-&gt;</code> is typed, it is temporarily replaced with <code>→</code>. When the replaced symbol is extended with <code>n</code> immediately after that, <code>→n</code> gets replaced by <code>↛ </code><br>\n1.2) Like 1.1, but the temporary replacement of non-unique abbreviations only happens after a timeout (like 400ms).</p>\n<p>2) <em>Autocompletion</em>. I think it might make sense to implement autocompletion for all available abbreviations. This might conflict with (1.1) though.</p>\n<p>3) <em>Context Sensitivity</em>. When there is <code>h₁</code> around in the current document but no <code>h1</code> and I type <code>h1</code> and then hit tab, it might be a cool feature if <code>h1</code> could be replaced by <code>h₁</code>.</p>\n<p>What do you think?<br>\nThese features shouldn't be too hard to implement on top of my refactoring.</p>",

What system is this?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is a longer description at the link I posted.  This is an input method.  Typically you use input methods for languages like Japanese/Chinese/etc. where it's infeasible to have one key per character, e.g. you type <code>jidouteirisyoumei</code> and you get <code>自動定理証明</code>. This works in every application, terminal, etc.  At least on linux it's fairly easy to add \"table-based\" input methods where you just need to provide a file with all the translations.  That's what I did for lean and now I can switch to Lean input using a key shortcut.
