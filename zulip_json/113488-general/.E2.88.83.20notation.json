But I came unstuck yesterday with <code>∃</code>. It's a random unicode character, so it's going to be notation. I know the answer -- it's going to be <code>Exists</code>. But <code>#print notation ∃</code> doesn't tell me this -- it just says <code> `∃`:1024 binders `,`:0 (scoped 0) := #0` </code> and I read this as saying \"this is fancy notation using some tricks, but I'm not going to tell you exactly how it expands\" (note that <code>Exists</code> is not mentioned explicitly in the output). Ali Sever just pointed out to me that if you actually _use_ the notation, i.e. write <code>example : ∃ n : ℕ, n = 0 := sorry</code> and then right-click on <code>∃</code> with the cursor to the left of the symbol (note: cursor on the right doesn't seem to work!) then it takes you to the definition of <code>Exists</code> and, fortunately, the notation is defined a few lines below, so you are likely to spot it (although I guess in theory the notation could have been defined somewhere completely different). Am I missing a trick? I was expecting some kind of way of going from the <code>∃</code> symbol in a lean file to the exact line <code>notation `∃` binders `, ` r:(scoped P, Exists P) := r</code> and this is what I can't find.</p>",
