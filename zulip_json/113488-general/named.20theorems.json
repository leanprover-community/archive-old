I honestly cannot imagine actually looking up the squeeze/sandwich theorem according to the symbols in its statement, especially since there is possible variation in that statement and a more high level description that indicates which variables are less than which is necessary for indicating the meaning anyway. In such a situation the conventional name is far more effective. (Plus, the whole reason for these naming conventions is because mathematicians never stepped up and named them themselves. When they do, I think it's better to defer to them.)</p>",
