This is a very large monolithic proof (~200 lines) that doesn't seem easy to break down into smaller lemmas and doesn't seem to have any particularly inefficient step either (at least the profiler doesn't reveal anything egregious, and the simps are already squeezed). Is there a way to increase the timeout on individual declarations that \"deserve\" it like this one?</p>",
