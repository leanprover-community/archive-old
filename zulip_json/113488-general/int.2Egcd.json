I've tried doing it but it has some other consequences. We probably then should also move the lcm results to the <code>data/int/gcd.lean</code> file. But those are proved using the gcd_monoid results. So we need to import gcd_monoid into <code>data/int/gcd.lean</code>. Is that OK? <br>\nOne consequence of that was that we get a circular import from this result:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">lemma</span> <span class=\"n\">pow_gcd_eq_one</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">M</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"o\">}</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">monoid</span> <span class=\"n\">M</span><span class=\"o\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">M</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">m</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">â„•</span><span class=\"o\">}</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">hm</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"bp\">^</span> <span class=\"n\">m</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">hn</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"bp\">^</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"bp\">^</span> <span class=\"n\">m.gcd</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>General monoid theory needs this result about (extended) gcds, but gcds need ring theory that needs monoids. This can be fixed by splitting out the extended gcd results into its own file. Is all this worth the effort? If so, I can PR this. Or just PR it and see what the reviewers think.</p>",
