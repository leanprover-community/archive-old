I'd like to have a library where I can generate SMTLIB (specifically the uninterpreted functions/sorts, bitvectors, and arrays), and express semantically what it means for a set of SMTLIB assertions to be satisfiable from a model-theoretic definition.  I can start one, but don't want to duplicate existing work.</p>",
