The first is that using forall, I'm required to <code>intro</code> the <code>a</code>.  This is no mystery to me, makes perfect sense.  The second difference is that I can't use the latter theorem everywhere I can the former.  There are some places I can use both just fine, it's not that the latter is useless, but some places it seems like only the former works.  For example the following works fine with the forall version but not the implicit arg version:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">theorem</span> <span class=\"n\">add_left_cancel</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">A</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"o\">}</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">ring</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span><span class=\"o\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span><span class=\"o\">}</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">c</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"bp\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">c</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span> <span class=\"bp\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">c</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">begin</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">intro</span> <span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">rw</span> <span class=\"bp\">←</span> <span class=\"n\">add_right_id</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">rw</span> <span class=\"bp\">←</span> <span class=\"n\">add_right_id</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">rw</span> <span class=\"bp\">←</span> <span class=\"n\">add_right_inv</span> <span class=\"n\">c</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">rw</span> <span class=\"n\">add_assoc</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">rw</span> <span class=\"n\">add_assoc</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">rw</span> <span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">end</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>For the implicit arg version I get the error:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">function</span> <span class=\"n\">expected</span> <span class=\"n\">at</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">add_right_id</span>\n<span class=\"n\">term</span> <span class=\"n\">has</span> <span class=\"n\">type</span>\n  <span class=\"bp\">?</span><span class=\"n\">m_1</span>\n<span class=\"n\">state</span><span class=\"o\">:</span>\n<span class=\"n\">A</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span> <span class=\"n\">u_1</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n<span class=\"n\">_inst_1</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ring</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n<span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span> <span class=\"n\">c</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n<span class=\"n\">f</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"bp\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">c</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span> <span class=\"bp\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">c</span>\n<span class=\"bp\">⊢</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This is mostly jibberish to me, but <code>u_1</code> and <code>?m_1</code> clue me in that this might be a universe issue?
