Reading the article it seems that he thought he'd found a short cute argument but then there was a problem and he didn't want to delete the post, so it ended up being a long non-cute argument.  I would suggest formalising a high-powered argument because high-powered commutative algebra should be fine to do in Lean and we would like to see more of it.</p>",
