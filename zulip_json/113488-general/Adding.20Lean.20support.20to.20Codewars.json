The Codewars community has recently been pondering about adding Lean support to <a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.codewars.com/\">Codewars</a>, which is a recreational/competitive programming OJ website and probably the only one that currently supports theorem-proving languages (currently Coq, Idris and Agda) to any meaningful extent.</p>\n<p>Seeing as the last stable version of Lean 3 has been released and Lean 4 development is well underway, I would like to ask the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long until the first beta/stable version of Lean 4 is officially released?</li>\n<li>Once Lean 4 is officially released, how long before Lean 3 will be (more-or-less) completely phased out?</li>\n<li>To what extent will backwards compatibility be broken between Lean 3 and Lean 4? Will it be that only certain Lean 3 projects relying on advanced Lean features be broken in Lean 4, or will even the simplest Lean 3 project (e.g. on the scale of one of the levels of the <a href=\"https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/\">natural number game</a>) possibly no longer compile under Lean 4?</li>\n<li>Therefore, if Lean support were to be added to Codewars in the near future, is Lean 3 or Lean 4 a better choice, or is it better not to add Lean at all?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For your reference, here is the <a href=\"https://github.com/Codewars/codewars-runner-cli/issues/773\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Codewars/codewars-runner-cli/issues/773\">issue ticket for requesting Lean support on Codewars</a> - if you are interested in this, please do leave a <span aria-label=\"+1\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f44d\" role=\"img\" title=\"+1\">:+1:</span> on the issue to show your support <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-263a\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",

Our guesses are: maybe late this year, maybe beginning of next year. The only thing that has been said is that it will be in 201X, and we now know that X ≥ 10.</li>\n<li>Phasing out of Lean 3: We are currently transitioning to Lean 3.5.c, a version that is maintained by the community. So we might start \"phasing out\" Lean 3.4.2 pretty soon. This move isn't too drastic. The move to Lean 4 will take a lot more time. Again, no official statements. We'll be done with the migration of mathlib once we're done.</li>\n<li>Backwards compatibility: This will be broken pretty seriously.

The reason mathematicians like me don't use it yet is that it's not yet usable as an interactive theorem prover.
