While people do consider tiling problems where a tile includes some boundary points but not others and every point (of the plane, 3-space, etc.) must be covered exactly once, they feel very different from most tiling problems where points on boundaries are expected to be covered more than once (and in any case, they are just a special case of the topological version, when you take the discrete topology). If you don't want to involve topology for working formally with discrete tilings, that probably indicates having appropriate separate definitions such as <code>discrete_tiling</code>, and explicit <code>equiv</code>s and lemmas translating between those definitions and the general topological ones in the case of the discrete topology.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, restricting to the plane, or a \"non-compact metric <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">n</span></span></span></span>-manifold\" as Goodman-Strauss does, is unnecessary and would prevent the definition from covering discrete tilings. The \"countable\" constraint in Grünbaum and Shephard is unnecessary (that's simply a particular choice of index type, and the index type would be a parameter to definitions such as <code>tiling</code>). \"compact\" and \"closure of its interior\" for tiles, as suggested by Goodman-Strauss, don't seem to be needed for a general definition; they're simply conditions for being well-behaved that could be hypotheses on relevant theorems, much like \"tiles are closed topological discs\" or \"the tiling is locally finite\". Likewise any constraint that a protoset of tiles is finite; again, that's just another choice of index type.</p>\n<p>I think key insights in Goodman-Strauss's definition include (a) that the space being tiled comes with some group of automorphisms and (b) defining a tiling of a given protoset of tiles is more interesting than defining a tiling in isolation from a choice of protoset.</p>\n<p>So I'd be inclined to start by defining a <code>tiling_space</code> to be a topological space together with a subgroup G of the group of homeomorphisms of that space (typically it would be a metric space and a subgroup of isometries, quite likely all isometries or all orientation-preserving isometries, but I don't think that needs to go in the most general definition; in the discrete case this would become a group of permutations). A tiling space is a context in which you can both define tilings by a protoset of tiles and have concepts (looser than equality) of whether two tilings are the same.</p>\n<p>Then we need to define a protoset of tiles in a <code>tiling_space</code>. That would be an indexed family. For each index value, there would be both the tile itself (a closed set) and a subgroup of its stabilizer under the obvious action of G. The point of specifying that subgroup is to cover the common case where tiles are considered to be marked in order to reduce their symmetries; an unmarked tile corresponds to taking the whole of its stabilizer.</p>\n<p>Then to define a tiling (or packing, or covering - an indexed family of tiles from a protoset, which may be required to satisfy certain other conditions), given a tiling space, a protoset and an index type for the tiling itself, for each value of that index type you specify (a) a value of the index type for the protoset and (b) an element of G, that maps that tile from the protoset to its position in the tiling.</p>\n<p>This doesn't do anything special to handle matching rules - those would need to be some extra predicate applied to a tiling to decide whether it's valid or not.</p>\n<p>Given the above, there are two natural notions of whether two <code>tiling</code> objects are the same. One - same tiles in same positions and orientations - is that they are equivalent under an <code>equiv</code> of the index types of the tilings, together with multiplying each specified element of G on the right by some element of the specified subgroup of the stabilizer for that tile. Another is that they are equivalent if they are related by the above together with transforming the whole tiling by the same element of G.</p>\n<p>Note that I suspect there are no mathematically interesting results to be proved about <code>tiling</code> in such generality - to get anything interesting, you need to start imposing extra constraints on the tiling space, tiles and tiling. And results on tiling in the literature don't generally come with any thought on what the most general context in which they might hold is - they're more likely just to be stated for e.g. locally finite plane tilings by closed topological discs, if the authors even state such precise conditions at all.</p>",
