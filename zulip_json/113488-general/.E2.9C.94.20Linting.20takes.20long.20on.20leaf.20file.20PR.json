In that sense it is even more coarse grained than compiling oleans themselves.<br>\nYou can probably find other conversations about this here, but in short it is once again a nontrivial problem. A leaf file can add a simp lemma that breaks an earlier one (in the sense that the simp_nf linter will complain about it now), so it is not enough to only check the new file. <code>simp_nf</code> is apparently one of the slowest linters anyway, so we might not even gain that much by running only a select few linters on all files.</p>",
