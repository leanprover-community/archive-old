I see that <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110026\">@Simon Hudon</span> has made another PR <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/936\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/936\">936</a> which changes the build testing process, presumably to fix this problem.  The root cause seems to be that I read the <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/howto-contribute.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/howto-contribute.md\">how to contribute</a> page and the linked page on <a href=\"https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/\">fork-and-branch workflow</a>, and following those instructions, made my changes in a new fork of mathlib at <a href=\"https://github.com/NeilStrickland/mathlib\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/NeilStrickland/mathlib\">https://github.com/NeilStrickland/mathlib</a>.  But I see that none of the other open PRs are doing that, they just come from branches of leanprover-community/mathlib.  Are those instructions considered to be outdated?  If so, is there anything newer?  Would I need permissions to work with branches of leanprover-community/mathlib?</p>",
