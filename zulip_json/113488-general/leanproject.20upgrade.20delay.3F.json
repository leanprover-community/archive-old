Is this expected? </p>\n<p>I also tried making a new project with <code>leanproject new test</code> and the same thing happens -- mathlib is not completely current.</p>\n<p>I'm mostly wondering whether this is expected behavior and things should be updated after some time, or if there are some other issues.</p>\n<p>Some additional info: leanproject pulls the following mathlib commit: <br>\n<code>394719f58c3bdb39ef811d8ec76fc120a631975d</code><br>\nbut manually using <code>git pull origin master</code> in the <code>_target/deps/mathlib</code> folder gives a more recent commit:<br>\n<code>a5b7de0a178fc31eb6a12b2e62c68a0ea8e63a89</code> (as expected)</p>",
