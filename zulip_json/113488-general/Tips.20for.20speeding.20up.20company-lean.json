Today I had some OS upgrading issues and had to remove electron (and thus also vscode), so I tried emacs again, and I was immediately reminded of why I switched to vscode -- writing lean in emacs is tediously slow!<br>\nOne of the main culprits is <code>company-lean</code> which is automatically trigerred in my setup (I'm using doom emacs, and <code>lean</code> is available as one of the built in packages). When it's triggered, all typing seems to stop, and things become unusable for several seconds.<br>\nDoes anyone have any hints for speeding up <code>company-lean</code>? Does anyone have any hints for speeing up lean development in emacs in general?</p>",
