In truth you can always add the axioms of ZFC or what have you and have all the dependencies you need, so it's possible in principle. (You don't even need anything past FOL for ZFC.) But automation support would have to be written from the ground up. Again, doable in principle, but it would make enough of a break from the existing libraries that it may as well be \"lean ported to HOL light / isabelle\" rather than coexisting with the libraries that are already there.</p>",
