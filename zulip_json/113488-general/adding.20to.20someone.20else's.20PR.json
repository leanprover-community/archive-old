I now need to prove it's a sheaf of commutative rings and we will have our first examples of schemes. However I need a little more transport of structure. In particular I need that the direct limit of commutative rings is a commutative ring. I asked Kenny if he'd done this and he said that he did a big direct limit PR recently but he only did rings, not commutative rings.</p>",
