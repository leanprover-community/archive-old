I think we've been fairly good about meeting these guidelines in new PRs, but there's still a lot of library missing documentation. So here's a request to the community: let's get the linear algebra directory up to speed. It's a pretty clean corner of the library, and used in various places. It deserves to be better documented. I hope that some of the main contributors (<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110044\">@Chris Hughes</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"112680\">@Johan Commelin</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"129120\">@Alexander Bentkamp</span>  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110294\">@Johannes HÃ¶lzl</span> ) will be able to help, but PRs are welcome from anyone.</p>",
