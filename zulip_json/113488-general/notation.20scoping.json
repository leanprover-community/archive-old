Why it changed, I don't know, and I'm not clear on whether to expect this to be different in lean 4.<br>\nI think that lean 3 notation is not handled very well at all, this is why I avoid all notation overloading in mathlib</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lean 2 used the notion of \"metaclasses\" to scope notations, coercions, and attributes declared in namespaces. To use them, you had <code>open</code> the namespace, either with an explicit list of metaclasses, or with all of them as the default. It was annoying and didn't make any sense for most of the metaclasses - except perhaps for notations and <code>classical.prop_decidable</code>. We completely removed metaclasses for Lean 3.<br>\nI'm open to proposals for a notation (and macro) scoping system in Lean 4. A survey of designs in other systems would probably be a good first step.</p>",

Interpretation scopes provide a weak, purely syntactical form of notations overloading: the same notation, for instance the infix symbol + can be used to denote distinct definitions of the additive operator. Depending on which interpretation scopes is currently open, the interpretation is different. Interpretation scopes can include an interpretation for numerals and strings. However, this is only made possible at the Objective Caml level.</p>\n<p>See Figure 12.1 for the syntax of notations including the possibility to declare them in a given scope. Here is a typical example which declares the notation for conjunction in the scope type_scope.</p>\n<p>Notation “A /\\ B” := (and A B) : type_scope.<br>\nNote</p>\n<p>A notation not defined in a scope is called a lonely notation.</p>\n<p>Global interpretation rules for notations<br>\nAt any time, the interpretation of a notation for term is done within a stack of interpretation scopes and lonely notations. In case a notation has several interpretations, the actual interpretation is the one defined by (or in) the more recently declared (or open) lonely notation (or interpretation scope) which defines this notation. Typically if a given notation is defined in some scope scope but has also an interpretation not assigned to a scope, then, if scope is open before the lonely interpretation is declared, then the lonely interpretation is used (and this is the case even if the interpretation of the notation in scope is given after the lonely interpretation: otherwise said, only the order of lonely interpretations and opening of scopes matters, and not the declaration of interpretations within a scope).</p>\n<p>The initial state of Coq declares three interpretation scopes and no lonely notations. These scopes, in opening order, are core_scope, type_scope and nat_scope.</p>\n</blockquote>",
