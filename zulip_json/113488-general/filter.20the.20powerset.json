However, I don't know how to fill in the <code>sorry</code>. My functional programming is shaky, but I can't see a way to get an <code>hX</code> from the left to the right of the 'such that' in the set definition, although it seems that a proof should 'obviously' exist. Can someone help me with this?</p>",
