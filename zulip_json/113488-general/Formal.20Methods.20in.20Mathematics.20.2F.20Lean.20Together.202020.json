Monday to Wednesday will feature invited speakers on a range of topics (with a break on Wednesday afternoon), and Thursday and Friday will be a Lean workshop.</p>\n<p>Rob and I are starting to think about how to block out the time for Thursday and Friday. Here are some things we want to fit in:<br>\n- A presentation on Lean 4 from Sebastian Ullrich and a subsequent discussion.<br>\n- A discussion of plans for <code>mathlib</code>, as well as infrastructure and tools for maintaining it.<br>\n- A discussion of the Formal Abstracts project.<br>\n- Short, informal presentations of recent work and work in progress.<br>\nIf any of you have other suggestions for things we should budget time for, please let us know.</p>",
