        "content": "<p><code>succ_pred_eq_of_pos</code> says <code>n &gt; 0 → succ (pred n) = n</code> and it's in core Lean. I just applied it and ended up with a goal <code>card s &gt; 0</code> with <code>s</code> a multiset, and then I tried to rewrite <code>multiset.card_pos_iff_exists_mem</code> but the rewrite fails because the hypothesis is <code>0 &lt; card s</code>. That's kind of annoying and it's not the first time today that this has happened to me. I feel like <code>succ_pred_eq_of_pos</code> should say <code>0 &lt; n  → succ (pred n) = n</code> but I guess there's nothing that can be done about this? Or am I missing a trick? Currently I'm just using <code>show</code> to rewrite the goal so it uses <code>&lt;</code>.</p>",
