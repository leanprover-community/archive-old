While this is sometimes useful (e.g., if you're proving an <code>ext</code> lemma for a type synonym using the <code>ext</code> lemma for the original type), quite often this is not what I want. For me, the most annoying scenario is <code>ext</code> applying <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/option.ext\">docs#option.ext</a> to equality of two <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/ennreal\">docs#ennreal</a> numbers (so I have to use <code>ext1</code> to prove equality of measures).<br>\nIt would be nice to stop <code>ext</code> seeing through these definitions. The old behavior can be available through <code>ext!</code> or <code>ext { some_option := tt }</code>.</p>",
