My solution in the end was to simply give up trying to build <code>my_namespace.nat</code> and as you can see at <a href=\"https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2017/10/31/building-the-non-negative-integers-from-scratch/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2017/10/31/building-the-non-negative-integers-from-scratch/\">https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2017/10/31/building-the-non-negative-integers-from-scratch/</a> I just called them <code>xnat</code> instead (x for xena). I was even super-paranoid and made them in a <code>xena</code> namespace. Now the trick is to make sure nobody opens <code>nat</code> :-) and then I found that my problems had gone away. Within the <code>xena</code> namespace I could define things like <code>add_assoc</code> and because of this pile of preventative measures I could be fairly confident that nobody would be trying to use the default <code>add_assoc</code> later on when proving <code>add_comm</code> or whatever for <code>xnat</code>. You might want to call my solution a workaround, but I took the practical viewpoint that it wasn't my job to teach people about namespaces -- they were mathematicians. You might be in a different situation of course.</p>",
