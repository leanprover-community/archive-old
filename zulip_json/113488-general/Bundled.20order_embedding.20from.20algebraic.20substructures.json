Would be wonderful if someone does it systematically. There are some such maps that come from <code>extends</code> (e.g. <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/subalgebra.to_subsemiring\">docs#subalgebra.to_subsemiring</a>) which aren't bundled by default though, so a new name would need to be assigned to the bundled version.</p>",
