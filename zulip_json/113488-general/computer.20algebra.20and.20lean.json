If, as I groked from Kevin's classes, the underlying  interfaces are actually very close (with the CAS on the \"computing explicitly\" side and the prover on the \"apply axioms\" side of the interface), it may pay off to have them actually match.</p>\n<p>Comments of course welcome!</p>",

A big obstacle is setting things up in a way that you can generate a Lean-only proof certificate from your interaction with the bridge, so that the software at the other end of the bridge isn't required for every recompilation. There's generally a problem that we have no intermediate layer between <code>.lean</code> files and <code>.olean</code> files, where we can cache large automatically generated proof objects.</p>",
