I have noticed that I write inconsistent docstrings as a consequence (not that they prove false, just that I refer to classes using an inconsistent convention). I am not sure whether consistency is important here but given that my PhD student Ashvni Narayanan seems to have done a super job on the <code>bundled-subring</code> branch and I'm just going through it and tidying up docstrings etc before a PR (and I want to put a docstring on <code>subsemiring.lean</code>, despite the fact that nobody will probably ever read it -- who cares about subsemirings? ;-) ) I thought that now might be a good time to either come up with a convention or declare that we are happy that some people say \"let R be a ring\" and others say \"let R be a <code>ring</code>\".</p>",
