He doesn't do any lean, but he's very good with windows installers, linux packaging, iOS apps, android apps and all sorts of boring software engineering fluff (actually he doesn't think it's boring, which is why I like him even more!). I think lean could use some help in that regard. Happy to chat more if anybody's interested. I vaguely remember <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110038\">@Kevin Buzzard</span>  in particular raising some issues with windows installers for lean or something along the lines.</p>",
