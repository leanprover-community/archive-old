There was an instance <code>f.is_group_hom</code> saying exactly that, except that the <em>instance</em> that <code>β</code> was a group was different in the instance and in the type class problem. In the existing instance it was <code>comm_group.to_group β.comm_group</code> and in the type class problem we had is was <code>comm_group.to_group (linear_ordered_comm_group.to_comm_group β.linear_ordered_comm_group)</code>. Here <code>linear_ordered_comm_group</code> is a new class in their project, extending <code>comm_group</code>, with the old structure command turned on. Now the instance of <code>β.linear_ordered_comm_group</code> was defined extending <code>β.comm_group</code>, which means that the equality <code>linear_ordered_comm_group.to_comm_group β.linear_ordered_comm_group = β.comm_group</code> holds definitionally. However, the only way to establish this definitional equality is to establish the definitional equality of all fields. I don't know exactly why, but this was really hard for Lean during type class resolution. It caused a deterministic time-out.</p>",

If the <code>instA</code> instance is used, it can cause extra unnecessary unification work during type class inference (if those instances are used as <em>arguments</em> of other definitions/instances). This can cause (deterministic) timeouts. It is especially bad with the old structure command option, and it even happens when both possible instances of <code>classA</code> are definitionally equal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One problem is that this is not always possible: maybe <code>instA</code> needs fewer or weaker hypotheses.
