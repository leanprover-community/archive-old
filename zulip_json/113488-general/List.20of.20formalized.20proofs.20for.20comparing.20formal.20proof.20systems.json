Sorry this is a newbie question, hope it fits here: I have seen a few times <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110038\">@Kevin Buzzard</span> mentioning a List of theorems, and whether they are formalized in various formal proof systems. The list is names after a person, but i cannot find it anymore. Does anybody know what i am talking about? thanks :)</p>",
