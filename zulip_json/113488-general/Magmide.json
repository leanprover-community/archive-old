They want to create not just a dependently typed language with fancy metaprogramming but also an imperative object language and a program logic for it. It's just a lot, especially since the guy behind it doesn't seem to be an expert in any of these domains. So while I wish him luck, I wouldn't hold my breath.</p>",

I'm with Jannis in that I'll hold off judgment until I actually see more than a tech startup pitch. (Obviously I'm very on board with the pitch.)</p>",
