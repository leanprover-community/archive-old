        "content": "<p>I've been invited to give a talk about Lean tactics at the upcoming DeepSpec summer school. It's a 5-10 minute talk that other participants do as well. I'd like to walk the audience through the writing of a tactic that I can contrast with Coq tactics. I thought of presenting tactics like <code>refine_struct</code> but it plays a lot with the internals and I'm not sure that a non-Lean-user would see the point. </p>\n<p>Now I'm thinking of presenting <code>tauto</code>. Yesterday I added the closure over symmetric relations before <code>tauto</code> starts so that when it sees <code>¬ a = b</code> and <code>b = a</code> in the assumptions, it can finish the goal right away. It would be an interesting contrast to Coq because I use a table of expressions for that closure. I can't begin to imagine how you'd do that in Ltac</p>",
