Doing stuff like this is a great way to learn Lean, however quotients can be complicated so it's a bit of a tricky place to start.</p>\n<p>Note that mathlib thinks about stuff like \"canonical bijections\" in quite an abstract way and is very careful with what we mean by it: for example what you might think of as (and what is constantly explained to us as) a \"theorem\" is sometimes a definition in Lean. For example the first isomorphism \"theorem\" that a quotient by a kernel \"is isomorphic to\" or \"is canonically isomorphic to\" an image, would in Lean be expressed as a <em>definition</em> giving the explicit construction, because this is what we mathematicians actually need in practice rather than just the abstract statement that there is an isomorphism. </p>\n<p>Thinking about Atiyah-Macdonald, I'm not sure if we have primary decomposition in Lean, but although I'm not a commutative algebraist my impression is that that chapter hasn't aged well and people now emphasize different definitions. I also don't think we have Krull's intersection theorem but I might be wrong. Everything else is I think covered by what we have although sometimes you have to know what you're looking for, eg we might have some incomprehensible-looking definition involving a morphism of lattices and this turns out to me some way of expressing the third isomorphism theorem.</p>\n<p>If you're looking to do commutative algebra in general then we have essentially nothing on flat or projective modules beyond the definitions (and note that as a mathematician you might have several definitions of these ideas; we may only have one so there might even be work to do proving that various other definitions are equivalent to the one we have). Note however that homological algebra is currently being actively worked on, and until we've got the basics sorted out in some vast generality there is unlikely to be any access to Ext or Tor.</p>",
