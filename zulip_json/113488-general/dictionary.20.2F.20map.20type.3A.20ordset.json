Currently, we have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>native.rb_map</code>: meta interface to a C++ implementation of red black trees</li>\n<li><code>rbmap</code>: lean implementation of red black trees in core</li>\n<li><code>finmap</code>: maps via association lists (in mathlib)</li>\n<li><code>finsupp</code>: finitely supported functions (non computational)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The only one which is really suitable for computation is <code>rbmap</code> (<code>finmap</code> is too slow, since it is implemented with lists, although it is useful for specifications and verified computation), and it is implemented in core with basically only two operations: <code>insert</code> and <code>find</code>. And because the well-formedness condition is incorrect, you can't even implement more operations, like <code>erase</code>.</p>\n<p>So I decided to start anew with weight balanced trees, as a direct port from Haskell's <code>Data.Set</code>. The result is the <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/ordmap/data/ordmap/ordnode.lean\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/ordmap/data/ordmap/ordnode.lean\"><code>ordnode A</code></a> type, which has a very complete set of operations for working with sets and maps. The library for <code>ordset A</code> is still under development but will incorporate the correct invariants on top of <code>ordnode A</code> so that the usual properties are provable.</p>\n<p>PS: The names <code>ordnode</code>, <code>ordset</code>, <code>ordmap</code> are a bit inelegant, I'm open to suggestions.</p>",
