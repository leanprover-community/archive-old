At 9:30 I had a CoCalc project with my Lean teaching library and my exercise sheets, and Viviane Pons had upgraded all students projects using OpenDreamKit CoCalc credits. I still suffered a bit from <a href=\"https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/issues/3589\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/issues/3589\">https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/issues/3589</a> but students were able to work in the end.
