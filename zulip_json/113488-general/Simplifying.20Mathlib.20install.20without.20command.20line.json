Note that the Lean extension can already install elan since version 0.12, but it needs to ask the user to close and reopen VS Code so the path is updated and to offer to install on startup before a .lean file is opened. In addition to simplifying the install, we can elaborate menus for installing lean projects and also allow contributions to mathlib avoiding use of the command line. Are there any reactions to these two approaches?</p>",
