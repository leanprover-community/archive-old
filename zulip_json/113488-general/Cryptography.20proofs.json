The technology is built on top of the STARK proof protocol, but the protocol does not play a direct role in the formalization. The protocol provides efficient ways of verifying that that proof has/knows solutions to a parameterized family of polynomials, which you can use to encode information, computation, etc. Our formalization starts with a certain family of polynomials, and shows that they encode computation in a particular machine model.
