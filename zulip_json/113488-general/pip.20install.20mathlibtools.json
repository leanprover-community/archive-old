It probably means moving <code>$HOME/.mathlib/bin/</code> somewhere your shell won't look at.</li>\n<li>Make sure you have some version of python (at least python 3.5) with a working <code>pip</code> command, preferably in a weird setup (windows, multiple versions of python installed in conflicting ways...)</li>\n<li>try <code>pip install mathlibtools</code>  (or <code>pip3 install ...</code> or <code>sudo pip install ...</code> or <code>pip install --user</code> or whatever variation you can think of).</li>\n<li>go to the root folder of a lean project using <code>lean-3.4.2</code> and <code>mathlib</code> and type <code>update-mathlib</code> (see <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/install/project.md\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/install/project.md\">this doc</a> if you don't know how to make one)</li>\n<li>if you know what they are meant to do, you can also try <code>cache-olean</code> and <code>setup-lean-git-hooks</code></li>\n<li>Report here.</li>\n</ul>",
