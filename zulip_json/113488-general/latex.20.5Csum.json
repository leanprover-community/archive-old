In the docstring just below <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/formal_multilinear_series.continuous_on\">docs#formal_multilinear_series.continuous_on</a>, a latex command <code>\\sum</code> shows like a text <code>sum</code> instead of a nice Sigma. I had checked my latex using <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@bryangingechen/github-lean-doc-preview?url=%22https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fleanprover-community%2Fmathlib%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fsrc%2Fanalysis%2Fanalytic%2Fbasic.lean%22#docs\">https://observablehq.com/@bryangingechen/github-lean-doc-preview?url=%22https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fleanprover-community%2Fmathlib%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fsrc%2Fanalysis%2Fanalytic%2Fbasic.lean%22#docs</a> before submitting the PR, and there the Sigma shows up. Do you understand what is going on here?</p>",
