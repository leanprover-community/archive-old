I would have put it in <code>analysis/specific_limits.lean</code>, but trying to import <code>analysis.complex.basic</code> results in an import cycle. Also, I think I'll have to make it generic over <code>is_R_or_C</code> to remove the casts from the statement of the alternating series test anyways.</p>\n<p>I could state it using <code>∃ x, tendsto ...</code> instead. Perhaps you're saying it would be easier to prove this way? I chose <code>cauchy_seq</code> because the alternating series test and Dirichlet's test don't give any information about what the limit actually is, so I assumed you would have to through some analogue of <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/topology/algebra/infinite_sum.html#summable_iff_cauchy_seq_finset\"><code>summable_iff_cauchy_seq_finset</code></a> for conditionally convergent sums. Is this where I went awry?</p>",

I found the proof for Dirichlet's test was a bit nicer than proving the alternating series test directly. It generated some useful intermediate results, like summation by parts. It's possible that I've made the wrong choice, of course.</p>",
