I looked around for an iterative / hacker approach to mathematics and I found Lean. Can I use Lean to quickly iterate on problems and figure out if my solutions are correct without going to the professors to ask for help? I've installed everything, it works great, and now I'm trying to encode a problem that I want to solve through double counting. I'm proving an identity.  Is this possible in Lean?</p>",
