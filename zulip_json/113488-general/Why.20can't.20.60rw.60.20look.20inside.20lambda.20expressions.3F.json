Suppose I have a <code>finset.sum univ (\\lam x, f(x + x))</code> in my goal, and I know that <code>f</code> is a group hom. Then I want to rewrite that <code>f(x + x)</code> to <code>f(x) + f(x)</code>. But Lean always complains. So I have to do a little dance with <code>rw show [relevant part goes here]</code>, which feels clumsy. What am I doing wrong?</p>",
