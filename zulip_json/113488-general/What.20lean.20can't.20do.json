Only a human (or, if you insist, an ML trained on human math) can actually check that definitions are really what they are supposed to be. But because mathlib is a human-curated artifact, I think there is very low chance of something being totally mislabeled in mathlib, although sometimes it makes minor modifications as part of adapting to type theory and/or formalization, and sometimes the literature itself is split on where to assign certain names</p>",
