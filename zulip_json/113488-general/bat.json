The file is here: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/Julian/062e5ae6a6a5edfea23f8c89a7ff5d41\">https://gist.github.com/Julian/062e5ae6a6a5edfea23f8c89a7ff5d41</a> which was just converted from the vscode-lean file. Stick it in <code>$(bat --config-dir)/syntaxes</code>, run <code>bat cache --build</code> and yeah should work then. Trying to see if a PR to bat would succeed but will see if it meets their inclusion criteria.</p>",

Basically you use either one when you want to view stuff and aren't sitting inside an editor already (or when say, you are piping outputs from some commands to each other, which seems a bit less likely in this case).</p>",
