I haven’t seen a proof before or even a reference for this transfer theorem, so I am glad that my intuition worked out right. Does anyone know a more conceptual proof?</p>\n<p>The technical issue at the top of this thread about inability to rewrite no longer bothers me since last night, though <code>dsimp only</code> wasn’t actually useful because we can’t specify an argument so it ends up rewriting too much. And I didn’t end up using <code>change</code>; rewriting by right triangle first indeed worked well.</p>\n<p>Now the task is to make the proofs faster and shorter; currently the three proofs take 5.5s, 6.5s and 16s on my machine.</p>\n<p>And also to provide a simplified version in the case where <code>map_id</code> and <code>map_comp</code> are isomorphisms (pseudofunctor), where we can shave off an <code>op</code> (I think I don't need to repeat the proofs here); maybe I could also do the nLab version, as the proofs will be similar and won't add much effort.</p>\n<p>This has been an unexpectedly long digression:<br>\ntry to prove adjunction between overcategories Top/Y and PresheafedSpace/Y -&gt; need the <code>map_comp</code> natural isomorphism for presheaf pullback -&gt; try to define it in a canonical way -&gt; find <code>adjunction/mates</code> that suites my need -&gt; try to prove pseudofunctor compatibility conditions -&gt; try to do it in \"appropriate\" generality of lax functors (but falls short of defining 2-categories ...), that's how I get here. And I'm not even sure the first goal (the adjunction) is necessary for the main project (existence of limits in PresheafedSpace and eventually in LocallyRingedSpace)! I should really get back to that ...</p>",
