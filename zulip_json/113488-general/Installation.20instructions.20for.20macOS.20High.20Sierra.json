Most of the computers did fine, but there is one who has MacOS High Sierra and we didn't manage to make it work. I have no idea on how to use a Mac (I use linux myself) and I have no other similar Mac to test anything, so I'd be very grateful if someone can give me a concrete list of commands that I can run to get Lean working there...<br>\nThank you!</p>",

(Of course there's decent risk though in running an EOL'ed system, so if the hardware supports it, an upgrade is the best idea, but that's besides the point, especially if it doesn't). Probably doing so will mean quite a different install mechanism though, I suspect given Homebrew probably won't run at this point that you'll have to install fully manually.</p>",
