I don't even know myself -- I had to look it up before I answered, but it's certainly not uncommon that I see students with <code>(\\lam x, f x) (37)</code> in their goal or context (I just tell them <code>dsimp</code> right now). We have classical.some_spec but still have a <code>choose</code> tactic. Is there a reason for not having a <code>beta</code> tactic?</p>",
