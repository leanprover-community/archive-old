        "content": "<p>The innocuous-looking <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/5083\">#5083</a> has now morphed into a suggestion that some material in <code>algebra/group_power</code> be reorganised. As a random example, all <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/8d71ec995b05751b7aa8e7324ece8713bfb551d2/src/algebra/group_power/basic.lean#L529-L603\">this stuff</a> is about linearly ordered rings and semirings, so one might argue that <code>algebra/group_power/basic.lean</code> is perhaps not the right place for it any more (my memory of how this occurred was that a robust theory of powers was introduced after all the monoid/group/ring machinery was set up, and it was all thrown together in one file). Note also that <code>algebra/group_power/basic</code> imports <code>deprecated.group</code> and this might be a good chance to remove this import.</p>\n<p>So I'm thinking about how this stuff could be redistributed. The first question which springs to my mind is \"why the heck do we even have the directory <code>algebra/group_power</code> (containing <code>basic.lean</code>, a basic theory of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>a</mi><mi>n</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">a^n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.664392em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">a</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.664392em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\">n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> for <code>n : nat</code> and <code>a</code> in a monoid, group, monoid with 0, ring, canonically ordered semiring, linear ordered semiring, and also <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>g</mi><mi>m</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">g^m</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.858832em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">g</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.664392em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\">m</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> for <code>m : int</code> in the special case where <code>g</code> is in a group, and <code>identities.lean</code> which contains no groups whatsoever)? Can this directory be nuked, and the files in it be broken up and placed in more appropriate places? The main reason I need to ask this is that I don't understand the import heirarchy, it's never something I've paid any attention to because I usually work at the \"ends\" of mathlib, e.g. writing MSc algebra which just imports everything. Why do we have no <code>algebra/monoid</code>? Why do we have <code>algebra/group</code> and also <code>group_theory</code>? Is this all to do with imports?</p>\n<p>In short then, is the idea that <code>algebra/group_power</code> be nuked and the results moved to, say, <code>algebra/group/power.lean</code> and <code>algebra/ring/power.lean</code> a reasonable one? (or <code>group_theory/power.lean</code>?) Note that we have <code>algebra/group_with_zero/power.lean</code> which contains a ton of results about monoids with zero, objects which are more primitive than rings (indeed a ring, or even a semiring, is a monoid with zero).</p>",
