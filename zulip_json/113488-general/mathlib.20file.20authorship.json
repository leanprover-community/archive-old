The general idea is that<br>\nthe people listed there should be the ones we would reach out to if we had<br>\nquestions about the design or development of the Lean code.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think this captures the intent of the author list. In practice, it's very much not a list of everyone who has contributed to the file; this is typically tracked by the git history. Refactorings and file renamings can occasionally make the history hard to trace, but refactorings are also a problem for lists of contributors.</p>\n<p>Just wanted to highlight the change in case anyone has thoughts/comments, since it's a community policy thing!</p>",
