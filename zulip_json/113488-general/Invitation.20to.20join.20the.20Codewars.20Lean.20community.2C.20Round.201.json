April 2020), with 11 theorem-proving challenges (3 approved, 8 still in Beta) at the time of writing. Note that Lean support on Codewars is currently in the <em>alpha</em> stage, i.e. it is very much experimental for now and things (e.g. challenge setup, execution time limit, etc.) may change in the near future, so <strong>we are primarily looking for (moderately) experienced Lean users interested in trying out our platform to join at this stage</strong>, i.e. if you are a beginner just started with learning Lean then you may consider joining later (e.g. on a second invitation to be determined in the near future) for an optimal experience.</p>\n<p>Once you sign up for an account on Codewars, feel free to try out <a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/lean?q=&amp;beta=false\" title=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/lean?q=&amp;beta=false\">our current list of approved Lean challenges</a> (3 at the time of writing), known as <strong>Kata</strong> on Codewars. Approved Kata are challenges that have already passed the quality-checks and scrutiny of the community and therefore should be of high quality.</p>\n<p><strong>But more importantly</strong>, please also consider trying out <a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/lean?q=&amp;beta=true\" title=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/lean?q=&amp;beta=true\">our current list of Beta Lean Kata</a> (8 at the time of writing) if you've tried out the approved Kata and enjoyed the experience you had so far. Beta Kata are challenges contributed <em>by the community</em> that have yet to pass the quality-checks and scrutiny of the (rest of the) community. In order for Beta Kata to leave Beta, they have to be completed by other members of the community and receive a certain number of satisfaction votes and rank assessments.</p>\n<p>After you've tried some of the approved and Beta Kata, given that you are satisfied with the overall experience, <strong>please do consider authoring Lean Kata of your own to contribute back to the community</strong>. This could be something simple like an extension to one of the levels in the <a href=\"https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/\" title=\"https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/\">NNG</a> or something more challenging such as proving that all <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipschitz_continuity\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipschitz_continuity\">Lipschitz functions</a> are uniformly continuous (or even perhaps landmark results in complex analysis (for example)!). Your Kata will then pass through the Beta phase and (hopefully) eventually get approved as with every other Kata.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the Lean environment on Codewars, please refer to <a href=\"https://github.com/codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Language-Lean\" title=\"https://github.com/codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Language-Lean\">the Wiki entry</a>. You can also learn more about the <a href=\"https://github.com/codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Kata-Beta-Process\" title=\"https://github.com/codewars/codewars.com/wiki/Kata-Beta-Process\">Beta Process</a> here. And last but not least, feel free to drop by <a href=\"https://gitter.im/Codewars/codewars.com/\" title=\"https://gitter.im/Codewars/codewars.com/\">the Codewars Gitter chat</a> if you have any questions or would just like to discuss about Codewars in general.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For more computer-science oriented Lean users, you may be delighted to know that Codewars also supports Coq, Idris and Agda (support is pretty much stable) as well, with over 40 approved Kata and 20 Beta Kata spanning topics in discrete mathematics, programming language theory, verified functional algorithms ... If you see a (Coq / Idris / Agda) Kata that you would fancy being made available in Lean as well, feel free to leave a comment on the Kata concerned and we'll see which ones we can make available in Lean. <em>Alternatively</em>, <strong>if you happen to do Coq / Idris / Agda as well then feel free to (first) complete said Kata in one of those languages and submit a Lean translation to the Kata author, which, once approved, will make the Kata available in Lean for everyone</strong> <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-263a\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",
