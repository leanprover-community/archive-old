See my idea is that the library should always be searching as my user's graph input changes so that the \"Apply rule\" buttons automatically show up and the user just clicks one to logically transform their diagram.  I'm pretty certain Lean has some tools that do a search for applicable rules, from what I've read here in the past.  So how if negative on the above, then how do these community plugins perform their searching?</p>",
