There must still be some deprecated imports here and there, but the key point is that (a) mathlib compiles (hopefully -- I just merged master) and (b) the quotient group file now uses bundled subgroups. I'm just waiting to see if mathlib compiles after the merge. There will probably be a few more PR's before we can completely remove the deprecated imports, but quotient groups are now using bundled subgroups in the <code>quotient_group_refactor</code> branch, and a lot of files were using quotient groups and have now also been updated.</p>\n<p>What happened here was that about a year ago I got sick of people saying \"subgroups should be bundled and it will be a major refactor\" but nobody was doing the refactor, and I wanted bundled subgroups anyway, and so encouraged some Imperial undergrads (Amelia and Jason) to bundle submonoids/subgroups regardless, and persuaded people to let them coexist in mathlib with the unbundled classes. This was a bit of a weird way to go about things -- for example when Mario refactored modules he just did everything in one go. So for a while now we've had two ways of dealing with subgroups, and newer mathlib files have been able to use the newer bundled approach, whilst some files needed the older approach. When Scott wanted to prove that Ab was an abelian category, he wanted to use quotient groups, which unfortunately were still using the old approach, Scott couldn't face building on what should be deprecated code, so he bit the bullet and started the refactor. Of course changing the quotient group file basically broke a bunch of mathlib -- the main reason people were still using unbundled subgroups was that they needed quotients.</p>\n<p>Another Imperial student, Ashvni, is currently bundling subrings (I think that writing these bundled classes is quite a good way to learn Lean). Hopefully the refactor of these will be less painful.</p>",
