Agda lets you use the question mark symbol to create what they call a \"hole\", which is a subgoal; the prover can take a guess at how to fill if you ask it. I found <a href=\"http://leodemoura.github.io/files/lean_cade25.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://leodemoura.github.io/files/lean_cade25.pdf\">http://leodemoura.github.io/files/lean_cade25.pdf</a> which suggests that the underscore should do something similar in Lean, but my feeble attempts with the underscore and with curly braces don't seem to replicate what Agda does.</p>",
