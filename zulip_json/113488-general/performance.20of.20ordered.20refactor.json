Also, given the option, I would like to test out the alternative approach that I had in mind, which would only introduce 2 typeclasses instead of 16, but each one taking two functions as inputs.</p>\n<p>Where can I start to learn about checking these things?  Would simply pushing to the github and monitoring the time CI takes to build the PRs be a good measure?  Would comparing the local build times on my machine be better?  I am really completely a novice in this, so any commentary, however silly it might appear, could be an eye-opener for me!</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
