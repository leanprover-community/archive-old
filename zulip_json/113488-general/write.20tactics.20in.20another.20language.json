Algorithm X can't be implemented efficiently in Lean but it can be implemented efficiently in C. how can i write a tactic in C and use it in Lean? is it even possible? i think it should be because the gptf tactic uses the OpenAI API, which is of course not a Lean feature</p>",

You can similarly run a local script via the command line or communicate with a locally running process.  This io interface is largely undocumented (except through the lean code and random posts here on Zulip).  Also, there is now built in support for JSON parsing in lean which makes this communication easier.  (But again, no good documentation.)</p>",
