I have to increase the font size to about 200% to make it readable in the classroom.<br>\nThe web interface has the habit of underlining #check commands in green. This underlining becomes extremely disturbing with increased font. I use the #check command extensively in teaching, since I find it very useful for exploring. Hence I would really be very happy if the underlining could be deactivated.<br>\nCan this be done?<br>\nThanks,<br>\nBenedikt<br>\nps. The non-community web interface has less aggressive underlining, but has the inconvenience of showing all the output, not just the output of the line the cursor is located at. Not sure what is the lesser evil...</p>",

If you buy one too for something like $14 then you can be showing them Lean in cocalc and they will be able to go to a website and <em>join in</em>. Students will be able to actually write code as answers to questions. It expires after one month. Students can also collaborate on projects without all the faff of GitHub (it's just like Google docs and I've seen it get quite funny with six people editing code at once)</p>",

A critical thing regarding using the web interface and zooming is that you should click the +/- magnifying glass icons in each panel to adjust <em>their</em> fonts, rather than just zooming the whole browser.   It's much more likely to work well.    For better (or worse) CoCalc doesn't underline anything, since you won't hit the same issue with <code>#check</code> when using CoCalc.    Also, with CoCalc, you can re-arrange the panels however you want by closing/splitting/changing modes (in the upper right), much like with Emacs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/QxyNyLdBZY95xgvqRSeidsut/pasted_image.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"pasted_image.png\">pasted image</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/QxyNyLdBZY95xgvqRSeidsut/pasted_image.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"pasted image\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/QxyNyLdBZY95xgvqRSeidsut/pasted_image.png\"></a></div>",

I use the feedback \"info\" buttons on the left of the editor window to read off Lean's answers: they pop up upon mouse-over.

I can definitely change this.    I view the font size as something that should be very easy to adjust locally, e.g., when ones eyes get tired, and it would be reasonable to make the bubbles have a consistent font size with the text.      I've made a Github issue for this <a href=\"https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/issues/4392\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/issues/4392\">https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/issues/4392</a>.   It probably won't get prioritized highly unless you ping me again though, since I have a lot of priorities right now...</p>\n<p>Note also that there is a fullscreen toggle in the upper right, which eliminates all the noise at the top.   Also an undocumented feature is you can shift+click on the tab for any file in CoCalc and it'll pop up just that file in a separate pop-window in fullscreen \"kiosk\" mode, which might be useful for a lecture (not sure).</p>",
