We chose one of the definitions at random (in fact we chose the one used in our source material), didn't prove the 30 page theorem (which <em>was</em> proved in the source material), and then when we wanted to define a presheaf on an affinoid adic space we realised we couldn't do it!

I think proving FLT should become a British tradition</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also, what if we find a mistake? We definitely need to do this before all of the authors retire in case we need them to fix the proof, so the money to do this soon is even more important. :P</p>",
