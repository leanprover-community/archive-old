I am maybe confused, but let <code>p</code> the characteristic of <code>K</code>. If <code>p = 0</code> or <code>p</code> does not divide <code>n</code>, then there are no problems (since <code>ne_zero ((n : ℕ) : K)</code> holds).  Otherwise, write <code>n=p^k * m</code> with <code>¬p ∣ m</code>.  We need to prove <code>adjoin_roots</code> in the definition of  <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/is_cyclotomic_extension\">docs#is_cyclotomic_extension</a>. Now, <code>x^n = 1</code> if and only if <code>x^m = 1</code> (since the Frobenius is injective), and the roots of <code>cyclotomic n K</code> are the <code>m</code>-th primitive roots of unity by <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/polynomial.is_root_cyclotomic_prime_pow_mul_iff_of_char_p\">docs#polynomial.is_root_cyclotomic_prime_pow_mul_iff_of_char_p</a>.</p>\n<p>Does someone see a problem in this proof?
