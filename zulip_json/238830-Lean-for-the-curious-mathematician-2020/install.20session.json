To clarify, what I meant were orange bars that quickly disappear. This was given as an indication in the youtube video that it's running fine. I have also successfully reproduced the infinitude_of_primes. So I guess it is working now? It's just strange that the leanpkg script was missing from bin and I had to manually copy it.</p>",
