        "content": "<p>Does Lean currently have support, or is there going to be support, for hammer-like interfaces with powerful ATPs?  Also, on the machine learning side, it seems that the most successful ML for ITP projects rely on having training data in the form of a dataset of proven theorems.  This requires proof recording.  Also, since Lean has so much syntactic sugar, it makes sense to try to strip that down to the bare bones in the training data, but to still keep the high-level tactic commands.  Indeed the best AI for ITP projects, TacticToe, HOList, CoqGym/ASTactic, and ProverBot9001 all seem to rely on a good tactic-level recorded proofs stored in a simple to parse format.  Moreover, to do reinforcement learning requires an interface which allows rapid back-and-forth between the proof-checker and some AI interface (attached to TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc. utilizing a GPU or many GPU machines).  I think Google Research spent a lot of effort writing their own HOL Light kernel and interface to make it usable for reinforcement learning.</p>",
