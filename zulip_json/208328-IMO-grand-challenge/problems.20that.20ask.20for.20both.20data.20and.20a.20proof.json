Even computability is too strong, some expressions are computable in theory but not really in practice (such as the exact 5th Ramsey number), and that can be the point of the IMO problem. For natural numbers, this structure can be just <code>num</code>, for reals something combining naturals with arithmetical operations including a real power plus constant pi. For some more advanced answers we probably should allow binders... if you look at the list of answers I have collected, some are pretty tricky.</p>",
