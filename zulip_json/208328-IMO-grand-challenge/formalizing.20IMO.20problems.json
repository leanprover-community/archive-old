The mark schemes aren't generally public and aren't systematically collected anywhere. If you find willing coordinators from past IMOs to grade I2I attempts, the number of attempts they can grade is limited, whereas an F2F AI can have millions of attempts graded automatically, as well as getting instant feedback while working on a problem about what is or isn't a valid argument.

I don't know any situation where one still has to do a case analysis <em>after</em> working with directed things in this way (it somehow wouldn't make sense -- when proving a polynomial identity, you never say \"if x &lt; 0, then ... else ...\"). Students often write arguments with undirected angles where there's some case analysis missing that becomes unnecessary using directed angles. People have different ideas about how to mark such scripts, but many seem to agree it would be unfair to punish students for not knowing about directed angles.
