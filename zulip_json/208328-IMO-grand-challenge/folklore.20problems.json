They are well known puzzles easier than IMO but in a similar language. Some of them are perhaps too easy to calculate, some may be even challenging to formulate, some are of the type that I really doubt that the current automation tools could solve them. Perhaps other people here have other favourite basic mathematical puzzle problems. Should I share the list (I would have to translate it to English first)? Are we interested in formalizing olympiad-like mathematical puzzles not necessarily coming from IMO?</li>\n</ol>",
