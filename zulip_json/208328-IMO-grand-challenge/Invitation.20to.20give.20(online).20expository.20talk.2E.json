Annually we attempt to solve problems of the most recent IMO. It was true September 2019 too when I apparently came across the announcement about  IMO Grand Challenge. Unfortunately I had no time during the year to join or (at least follow) the activities...</p>\n<p>But last Wednesday, September 30, I gave an introductory talk to the club about IMO Grand Challenge as an initiative of a group of experts on automatic proof to create a system that can systematically win gold at the International Mathematical Olympiad. Presentation (in English) is available at <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/13xlcgfy0zqvkEpsEA40fs-464_bhLEyd/view?usp=sharing\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/13xlcgfy0zqvkEpsEA40fs-464_bhLEyd/view?usp=sharing</a> and meeting recording (just in Russian) - at  <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tuBMqf5IBRGcfEhSngZJL4FKS5G7CMiU/view?usp=sharing\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tuBMqf5IBRGcfEhSngZJL4FKS5G7CMiU/view?usp=sharing</a>.</p>\n<p>So I just look for volunteers from the IMO Grand Challenge community  to give an expository talk for IU Math Club (and, maybe, for the World - Urbi et Orbi) about what currently is going on the community, who are involved and what is job flow. - I believe it will recruit more people ready to contribute (me and my students at least).</p>\n<p>You can just reply to this message or write my in person by email (provided below).</p>\n<p>Regards, </p>\n<p>Nikolay Shilov<br>\n(Just to introduce myself:  <br>\nDr. Nikolay V.

        "content": "<p>As far as I know, there is no serious automation attempt so far. The current status is rather trying to formalize IMO problems (problem statements and solutions), and we also have some very vague ideas on how some automated prover could work. Parallel to that, there are some machine learning experiments around theorem proving but really below the IMO level. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"230999\">@Daniel Selsam</span>  could be interested in giving a motivational talk but there is a question on how far beyond your motivational talk it could go.</p>",

The idea is to have an unbiased look at what people actually do when solving such problems.</p>",
