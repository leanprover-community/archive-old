The good news is that that creates an opportunity to observe/debug/improve the process of installing Lean on a Windows machine. Let me know if you're interested in that. I certainly want to get it done today.</p>",

However, some amendments to those instructions will be needed. I have detailed notes and a bunch of screenshots.

However, it might be more efficient for interested people to talk about it first while we are in Pittsburgh.</p>",
