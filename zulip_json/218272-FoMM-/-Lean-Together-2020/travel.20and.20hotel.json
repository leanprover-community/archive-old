I think you can get a ConnectCard at the airport to pay for the buses with stored value. It's probably worth it if you expect to take the bus more than just to/from the airport. If you pay cash, the bus drivers can't make change for you, which is annoying, so get some one dollar bills at the airport. There are also taxis, Lyft, Uber, etc, which will take 30-60 minutes depending on traffic and cost $40-60.</p>",
