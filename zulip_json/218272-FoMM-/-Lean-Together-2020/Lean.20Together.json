We have a handful of talks planned, but also some open blocks of time for discussion, planning, etc. There are a few things on the lineup already: we should talk about and coordinate peoples' ongoing projects, discuss moving mathlib to 3.5c, speculate about Lean 4, etc. But please think about other topics you'd like to bring up. If you let us know here in advance, we can add them to the official plan.</p>",
