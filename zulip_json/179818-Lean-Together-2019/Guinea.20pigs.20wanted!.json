Adding that might involve having to write a history feature, though. An alternative might be just to add links at the top of the webview to the manual and TPIL and to  somehow change the CSS so that the section navigation sidebar is more accessible, since for me the editor width is usually narrow enough that I have to scroll to the bottom to see it.</p>",
