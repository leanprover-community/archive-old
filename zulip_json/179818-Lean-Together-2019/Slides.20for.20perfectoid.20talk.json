I wasn't at all sure what to say to a room containing computer scientists, but somehow whilst speaking to them and answering questions it became a bit clearer to me what I could say and what level to go for.</p>\n<p>So here <a href=\"http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/docs/perfectoid.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/docs/perfectoid.pdf\">http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/docs/perfectoid.pdf</a> are the notes for my talk; they have the funny property that they were only written after the talk, but hopefully they capture the spirit of what is going on in perhaps a more coherent way than what I said off the top of my head on Thursday.</p>",
