I'm also staying at the Amsterdam Forest Hotel if you need assistance.  It takes about 15 minutes by bus (including waiting time and getting to the room at VU).  You can also walk to the VU, in summer it was a wonderful trip along Amstelveen's grachten; it takes about 30 minutes by foot.  If you intend to take public transport, I strongly recommend getting an OV chipkaart.</p>",
