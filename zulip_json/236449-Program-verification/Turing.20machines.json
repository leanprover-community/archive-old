(I haven't done anything about the other direction, proving that turing machines compute partial recursive functions, but I don't think it will be nearly as difficult.)</p>\n<p>I'm curious to see where people would like to see the computability library go in the future. My eye has been on defining computational complexity classes for a while, and I haven't done much with oracle turing machines but if there are interesting things to say there then it might be worthwhile. The TM construction in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/2792\">#2792</a> is careful to be polynomial time, using binary rather than unary representations of numbers, although there is probably around O(n^2) simulation overhead between the most basic TM model and the simulated partial recursive function.</p>",
