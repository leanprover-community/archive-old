In fact I am wondering whether that website basically tells the whole story in terms of type-theoretic differences.</p>\n<p>One thing that I think is worth stressing is that Lean's approach of a huge monolithic mathematics repo has hugely aided the development of what I sometimes rather rudely call \"mainstream mathematics\" in Lean, because such mathematics (algebra, number theory, geometry, topology, analysis) is quite interconnected and so beyond some point it's really important to have it all in one place. Mathlib developers seem to have no fear of the gigantic refactor, where a fundamental definition like <code>group</code> is changed and then everything breaks and needs to be fixed. I would imagine that the more standard approach, with smaller repos devoted to more specific tasks, would in practice be a nightmare when it came to things like this. </p>\n<p>Of course another huge difference between Coq and Lean is that Coq has a huge community of people working on projects completely unrelated to mathematics, whereas Lean is still quite a new prover and although it might be a sociological coincidence that much project development work is mathlib-focussed (or more specialised mathematics repos which have mathlib as a dependency), it is still undoubtedly true.</p>",

Probably this diversity accounts for (or is related to, in a feedback loop) some of the other differences in the ecosystems, such as having a monorepo or not. Lean is trying to solve an easier problem in some sense, or at least a more narrowly-focused one.</p>\n<p>One lesson for me from mathlib was that, as hard as it is to design a cohesive library for \"all\" of mathematics, it's far harder to design one that supports both classical and constructive reasoning well at the same time. Lean itself would support this just fine, but the problem is that classical and constructive mathematics are just not that similar--a classical notion (e.g., finiteness) might split into several notions constructively, or the classical description of an object (e.g. the spectrum of a ring) might be the \"wrong\" one constructively. Accepting these differences is fine (and necessary anyways) if you want to do constructive mathematics, but it's too high a price to impose on the user of a library for classical mathematics.</p>",

The place where people tend to start actually having disagreements is where you hit the real world with consumers you can't change when you update your code, and when you start releasing different bits of your code at different times.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think your thrust is right -- most devs would probably agree that working on a monorepo is generally much easier and the problem arises when people start having disagreements -- but I think your estimation of where that occurs is wrong. </p>\n<p>When consuming, most developers like small repos because they can mix and match according to their preference. When developing, a monorepo is generally preferable because it is quicker and easier to maintain. What causes a monorepo problems is when one party wants things done one way and another party wants it done another way (and both have sufficient manpower to promote their side).  This tends to be inevitable once there is a sufficiently large group of maintainers and/or consumers. Said disagreements on how things should be done lead to forks, splits, new libraries, etc. This also tends to lead to smaller projects as the fork / reinvention is usually more focused on the particularly thing they want to do differently rather than the whole of the original project. </p>\n<p>After encountering said trend one too many times, developers then choose to just skip the whole monorepo stage and just build small projects from the get go (where possible). Only when the project in question necessitates a large breadth or heavy standardization (e.g., compiler toolchains, OSes, browsers,   etc.) do  large projects tend to stick around. </p>\n<p>I think mathlib works as a monorepo largely because classical mathematics (as Kevin puts it sometimes, the \"mathematics that win Fields Medals\") tends to have a relatively agreed upon standard that mathlib can embody. Computer science adjacent mathematics, on the other hand, tends to be much less standardized and much more open to alternative interpretations (like much of CS itself) and thus it is much harder for communities with that kind of focus (which Coq is much more trendy in) to create a single product. Which approach one views as better is usually the result of which camp the user identifies with more (or what they wish to achieve).</p>",

(With the exception of including math based on non-classical foundations -- so far it's hard to mix these in the same framework. Classical ideas can generalize constructively in many ways, for example, as Reid mentioned.)</p>\n<p>Maybe if mathematicians had more experience with needing to write code that interfaces with the messy Real World they'd be less keen on the idea of a universal framework, and instead they'd opt for smaller projects, which as <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"315577\">@Mac</span> was suggesting one composes into an appropriate language/ontology for a specific problem.  However, I'm looking forward to see how mathlib progresses on its current path: fragmentation would put less pressure on testing whether all of (a certain kind of) math can be unified!</p>\n<p>(*) Mathematicians are very aware of the problem of differing terminology and differing notations across papers and textbooks, but I've never heard anyone say they didn't think that with sufficient resources it couldn't all be made consistent.</p>",
