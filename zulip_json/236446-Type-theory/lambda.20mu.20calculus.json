And the constructors determine how pattern matching looks like.</li>\n<li>Negative types are used by <em>coconstructors</em>, i.e. projections. And they are created by specifying each field. In other words, you pattern match on the coconstructors to <em>create</em> something of negative types.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In intuitionistic logic, they are not symmetric. The positive types dominate. So you can see how recursive positive types (i.e. inductive types) are well studied, have eliminators that capture the behavior of pattern matching etc. But recursive negative types (coinductive) are generally less studied, and you need something like bisimiliarity to get things done.</p>",
