I personally could imagine some site-wide macro file where <code>\\Q:=\\mathbb{Q}</code> and <code>\\C:=\\mathbb{C}</code> are defined (those are the two I miss the most) however I once wrote a joint paper where my co-author inserted <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/kbuzzard/b91827a4d8518cdbc9fa79bba24ceb3f\">the following 861 lines</a> at the beginning of our LaTeX file (these lines are at the top of every paper they write, apparently). I have some memory that <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110031\">@Patrick Massot</span> thinks this is a terrible design decision though. Do we as a community have any thoughts that we want to feed back to Zulip?</p>",
