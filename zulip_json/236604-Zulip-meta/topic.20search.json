This basically returned nothing. So I wrote out a long-ish question, and when I went to make a new topic, typing \"Equalit...\" gave some names that sounded like my question. It took me a frustrating few minutes to find these topics, even though I knew their names. AFAICT the ways are: type \"topic:EXACTNAME\" in the search bar; or, in the sidebar, click on \"more topic\" below a stream, then search in the bar that pops up. I think this is causing people to ask the same question over and over; there's &gt;2 topics already created to ask the same question I was about to create another topic for. Not sure what to do about this. If the welcome bot gave instructions like \"to find people asking a similar question, do X\", that might help people.</p>",

So if the topic auto-complete suggests a topic you think might be relevant, you can choose it from the auto-complete and then use the shortcut to navigate to it.</p>",
