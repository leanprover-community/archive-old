If it's to be opened again and merged, I think I'd like to replace <code>\\Rge0</code> by <code>\\R</code> and possibly <code>pseudo_emetric</code> by <code>pseudo_metric</code>. It seems <code>\\Rge0</code> is more of a burden than anything else, and all proofs go pretty much the same way with <code>\\R</code>.</p>",
