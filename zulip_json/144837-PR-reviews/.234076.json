I think it's fine if it is not uniform, but <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110596\">@Rob Lewis</span> is right to suggest there should be some comment explaining when to use each. I think you did the refactor that made <code>normal</code> a class --- could you suggest approximately what I should say here?</p>",

I am kind of leaning towards the idea that <code>normal</code> should be a bundled structure. This isn't much help for your PR I know, but the truth is that I cannot believe I have any kind of understanding of the situation which you and Rob don't understand 10 times better.</p>",
