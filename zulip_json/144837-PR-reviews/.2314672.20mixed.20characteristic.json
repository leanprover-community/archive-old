As it is self-contained and does not much interact with other parts of the mathlib yet, this should be relatively straight-forward to review.<br>\nIt is a bit longer (450  lines) but as it provides new defs + API I am not sure if it makes sense to split it up...</p>\n<p>All other changed files in the PR are from the dependencies ( <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/15101\">#15101</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14897\">#14897</a>) and simply shorten some proofs.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
