I feel like you're more likely to naturally have <code>decidable_rel (|)</code> in the parent monoid than <code>decidable_eq (associates α)</code>, but files like <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/0eed60e397689503092ef684a307add1e5bc4601/src/ring_theory/unique_factorization_domain.lean#L722\"><code>unique_factorization_domain</code> use the second</a>. However, I can also see this messing with <code>classical</code>, especially if you use something like <code>classical.dec_eq (associates α)</code>. What do people think?</p>",
