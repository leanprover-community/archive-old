This sort of thing came up earlier in <a href=\"#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Units.20of.20zmod.201\">this thread</a>. </p>\n<p>Another thing is the lemma <code>prime_iff_card_units</code>, which is actually true <em>even if <code>p = 0</code></em>, since <code>p-1 = 0</code> and <code>fintype.card (units (zmod p)) = 2</code>. But that gets back to the thread on <code>fintype (units (zmod n))</code> and how easy it is to make a computable instance of that fintype. </p>\n<p>To me it just feels more natural to put in the condition that <code>p</code> is big enough that we have a nondegenerate ring, even if it's not strictly needed.</p>",
