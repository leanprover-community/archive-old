You can have a look, but I've had to fix timeouts in the following files: <code>analysis/calculus/cont_diff</code>, <code>geometry/manifold/cont_mdiff</code>, <code>geometry/manifold/instances</code> (all of these were related), and <code>measure_theory/constructions/pi</code>. In the last one, Lean apparently couldn't figure out that the dirac measure on punit is sigma finite. I was able to help it, but ouch.</p>\n<p>So, I don't know what to do about this. <del>We'll see what CI says on my latest fix, but even if it comes back okay</del> (another timeout), I'm a bit worried.</p>",
