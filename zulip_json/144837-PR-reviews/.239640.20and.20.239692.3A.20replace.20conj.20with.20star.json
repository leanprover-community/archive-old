        "content": "<p>We have two PRs open right now for replacing <code>complex.conj</code> and <code>is_R_or_C.conj</code> by the <code>star</code> operation defined in <code>algebra/star/basic</code>: <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/9640\">#9640</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/9692\">#9692</a>. These show the two main options on the table for doing so:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/9640\">#9640</a>, the plan is to replace <code>conj</code> by <code>star_ring_aut</code>, which is the star operation bundled as a <code>ring_aut</code> (which is an upgrade over the current <code>ring_hom</code>), and define <code>conj</code> to be notation for it in the locale <code>complex_conjugate</code>. In the longer term, when we start using star more broadly, this would likely end up coexisting with differently-bundled versions of star (such as a linear isometry version for C*-algebras). As such, we set things up so that simp doesn't unbundle <code>star_ring_aut</code> so that lemmas for ring equivs can be used for complex conjugation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/9692\">#9692</a>, the philosophy is to treat <code>star</code> in a similar way as <code>neg</code>: the simp normal form is the unbundled version of the operation, and we systematically develop and use custom lemmas for <code>star</code> instead of using those for ring equivs. If we choose this option, the question of the naming scheme arises: should we do away with <code>conj</code> entirely and call everything star? Should we use some form of <code>conj</code> everywhere? A mix of both?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It would be nice to have some input before we make a decision. Personally I have a preference for the first option (we have bundled morphisms, why not use them?), but I can see the appeal of the second option.</p>",

But if we choose the second option, I think Frédéric and I have different preferences on the naming point (see discussion at <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/9692\">#9692</a>):  I would like to hide the word <code>star</code> from casual users of the complex numbers as much as possible, which probably necessitates a wholesale renaming of <code>star</code>, <code>star_ring</code>, <code>star_add</code>, ... to <code>conj</code>, <code>conj_ring</code>, <code>conj_mul</code>, etc.</p>\n<p>In other situations, the problem of \"different names in different fields of math\" is often solved by notation.  This happens to be a situation where that fix doesn't work, because the usual mathematical notation for complex conjugation, <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>z</mi><mo stretchy=\"true\">‾</mo></mover></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\overline{z}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.63056em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord overline\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.63056em;\"><span style=\"top:-3em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:3em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.04398em;\">z</span></span></span><span style=\"top:-3.55056em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:3em;\"></span><span class=\"overline-line\" style=\"border-bottom-width:0.04em;\"></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, is not supported by unicode.
