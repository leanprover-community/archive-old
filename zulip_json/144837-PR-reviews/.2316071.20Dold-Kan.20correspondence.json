(In particular, when it makes sense, the image of <code>Q q</code> consists of degenerate simplices.) Using this decomposition, some tools are introduced which shall be helpful when proving that the normalised Moore complex functor reflects isomorphisms.<br>\n(PR <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/16276\">#16276</a> about epi mono factorisations in the category <code>simplex_category</code> should also be ready now.)</p>",
