Replacing the <code>mono</code> assumption with these two equations probably will work as well, but I don't think this is worth it.</p>\n<p>Actually, I don't really think this glue data stuff would be used except for gluing sheaves / schemes this way. For other descent constructions afterwards, we will be working with a covering family, and we would know where our structures are descending to. I think this would need another interface, and I do not have any sensible way at mind to unify these constructions.</p>",
