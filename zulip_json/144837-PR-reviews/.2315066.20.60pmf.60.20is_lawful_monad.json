The only change is adding a lawful monad instance for <code>pmf</code> and replacing the custom <code>map</code> and <code>seq</code> operations with the standard operations provided by <code>monad</code>. I'm using <code>pmf</code> for another project and this change would simplify a lot of the things I'm working on there.</p>",
