I have not tracked down where the <code>ring</code> vs <code>semiring</code> assumption sneaks in: it is possible that it could be avoided in the proof that mathlib currently has.</p>\n<p>Still, I view the fact that the new proof is independent of the one for <code>mv_polynomial</code>s, it is strictly more general and also applies to <code>laurent_polynomial</code>s like all positive facts!  We also get to remove the older instance and some of the auxiliary lemmas leading up to it, which is what the last PR in the sequence does.</p>",
