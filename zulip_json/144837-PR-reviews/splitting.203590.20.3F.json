In this case, is the best practice to abandon this PR and make smaller ones containing the same things ? Or should I move some parts to other PR and keep this one as the final one ? </p>\n<p>Btw, I'm asking here because Patrick seems to be in holidays and I don't want to bother him with this <span aria-label=\"sweat smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" role=\"img\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span></p>",
