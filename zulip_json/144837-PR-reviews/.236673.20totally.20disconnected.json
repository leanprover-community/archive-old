This comes from some liquid tensor experiment code that I didn't write, but actually it comes from much earlier. The <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/464d04af8d25017b6d38ee28312c706973ca7d8d/src/topology/connected.lean#L637-L639\">definition of <code>totally_disconnected</code></a> is in term of <code>subsingleton</code> rather that <code>set.subsingleton</code>. I suspect this is a very old definition. I don't mind refactoring it, but I'd like to know whether anyone who used this definition sees any good reason to keep it.</p>",
