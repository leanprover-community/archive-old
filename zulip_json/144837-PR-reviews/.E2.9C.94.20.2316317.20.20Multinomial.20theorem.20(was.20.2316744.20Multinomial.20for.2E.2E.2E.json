I could make the noncommutative multinomial theorem independent of the noncomm_prod refactor but that would mean you'll have one more proof to fix, and it's just simpler after the refactor. I may try to fix the error when I get the time, and I'd rather you take another look at <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/16777\">#16777</a> and let me know the way forward :)</p>",
