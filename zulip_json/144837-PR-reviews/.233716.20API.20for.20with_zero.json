I've got it working but because I changed the <code>mul_coe</code> to the way around I thought it should be going in the process, it's broken a bunch of proofs (including some proofs in ennreal stuff which had non-terminal simps in). I've finally found the time to fix everything up; but am I going the wrong way here? Ultimately I just need the comm_group_with_zero from a group, for valuation theory. mathlib is compiling on the branch but it's bedtime and it wouldn't surprise me if the linter fails.</p>",
