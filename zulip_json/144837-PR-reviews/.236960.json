As a follow up, should it be renamed, or have aliases like <code>function.injective.equiv_range</code>, or <code>function.left_inverse.equiv_range</code>? How about the more powerful <code>function.left_inverse.{ring,alg}_equiv_range</code>?</p>",

And hopefully we can figure out a general theory of <code>equiv_like</code> maps, so that we don't need to redo the construction for each <code>foo_equiv</code>.</p>",
