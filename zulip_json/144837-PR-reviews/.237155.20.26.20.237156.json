I think this is best because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any name changes will have to be made to both files, and opening a separate PR will allow me to make those changes simultaneously without affecting another PR, making the refactor easier</li>\n<li>Any commit to either of the files in the interim will screw up both PRs so I would like to get them merged sooner rather than later</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
