I suppose if <code>s</code> is a set, then the idea is that <code>finite s</code> is the typeclass version of <code>set.finite</code>, and you can use the typeclass system to automatically construct these <code>set.finite</code> proofs (for example, using <code>set.finite_of_finite s</code>).</p>\n<p>I found naming things to be somewhat difficult here because there's both the predicate <code>set.finite</code> and the typeclass <code>finite</code>, so results about <code>finite</code> for <code>set</code> can't easily go in <code>set.finite</code>. Does the <code>finite.set</code> namespace seem fine?</p>",
