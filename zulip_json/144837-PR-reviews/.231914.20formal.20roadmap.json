        "content": "<p>I am very much a top-down person, and I have encountered a lot of issues with this approach, but I think that top-down is an important way to make a roadmap. We made the definition of a perfectoid space very early on in the BCM project, and there were sorries in the middle. We had heard all these scare stories from the computer scientists about how the ends might not meet, but they did, although we were terrified at one point that they wouldn't because our refl proofs were timing out; this turned out to be poor programming in our part, which Mario et al could guide us out of. </p>\n<p>I would love to make top-down roadmaps. In another thread I was talking about <a href=\"https://services.math.duke.edu/~jgetz/aut_reps.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://services.math.duke.edu/~jgetz/aut_reps.pdf\">this pdf which contains a definition of an automorphic representation</a>. It's definition 3.10. If you tell me that to write a roadmap to get to that definition I have to start at boring old section 1.1 I'm going to find it hard to do. The point, I think, is that after a while implementation issues just become irrelevant and everything is just structures, predicates, and the occasional theorem, whose proof you can sorry. These sorts of documents are just the kinds of things which mathematicians could be trained to write. Then someone has to come along and give some sort of estimate of how much work still needs to be done, and ideally attempt to referee the statements of the theorems which are missing.</p>",
