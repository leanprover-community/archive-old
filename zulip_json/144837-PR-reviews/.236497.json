I think a few people have looked at it, and I've just merged master and fixed bitrot.</p>\n<p>I'm happy to split off any of the changes to subsidiary files if that would be helpful.</p>\n<p>I have two more largish PRs (presumably plus smaller ones for distant files) that give us Weierstrass' theorem stated \"more abstractly\", and for other intervals, and that give us the Stone-Weierstrass theorem in general. But these have been sitting on the backburner while <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/6497\">#6497</a> is being reviewed.</p>",
