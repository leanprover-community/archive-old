In short, the PR will make CI fail after any build which produces output (e.g. from <code>#lint</code> or <code>squeeze_simp</code> or whatever). It does this by having the CI generate an additional file <code>src/.noisy_files</code> which lists the filenames of Lean files which have outputs. When pushing new commits to a branch, the CI will delete all the corresponding olean files so that they are rebuilt and the output can be detected.</p>",
