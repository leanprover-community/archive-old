It happens to still compile against the most recent master (tested locally) but it touches many files so I worry code rot might set in.</p>\n<p>One reason for the change is that <code>finset.bUnion</code> parallels the <code>set</code> API, so it will be easier to find and understand what it's for.</p>\n<p>(Maybe another reason to rename it is that there could be a <code>multiset.bUnion</code> defined using a fold of multiset union -- <code>multiset.bind</code> is a fold of multiset sums -- and then <code>finset.bUnion</code> would essentially be equal to <code>multiset.bUnion</code> in that <code>multiset.bUnion (Î» x, (f x).val) s.val = (finset.bUnion f s).val</code>.  The equation relating <code>finset.bUnion</code> and <code>multiset.bind</code> is a bit more complicated because it needs a <code>to_finset</code> to remove duplicates.)</p>",
