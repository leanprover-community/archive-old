But as soon as I import <code>data.nat.periodic</code>, errors popped up because there were instances of <code>card</code> lower down in the file previously interpreted as <code>finset.card</code> that were now being interpreted as <code>nat.card</code>. I can correct these, but then <code>group_theory.specific_groups.cyclic</code> downstream of totient also has a <code>card</code> that is ambiguous.<br>\nHow should this be dealt with? Should I simply go through every ambiguous notation that lean finds and disambiguate it?</p>",
