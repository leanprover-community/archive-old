The idea is to define the integral for all functions that coincide almost everywhere with a measurable function (i.e., which are measurable for the completed measure). It is a little bit painful, but I think it is definitely worth it. It is not building yet, but I'm already sharing it since I won't have time to work on it in the next few days -- maybe <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"214703\">@Yury G. Kudryashov</span> or <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"111080\">@Floris van Doorn</span> will want to have a look and share some thoughts!</p>",
