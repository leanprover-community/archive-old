Nearly all of the results have been restated &amp; proven using bundled maps now. The only thing that I haven't been able to make work was the proof for the uniqueness of the derivative, in which I ran into some trouble with <code>simpa</code>. Unfortunately, I don't expect to be able to return to this in quite a while.</p>",
