But I'd be very grateful if you could merge it soon because it touches 88 files...</p>",

The options then essentially become: 1) spend a really painful time looking for the relevant bits in review, 2) have Yury split the non-relevant rename bits into a new PR, if they're happy to do so. Then only one person has to work out which bits are relevent rather than every reviewer. 3) trust that the changes are ok without looking at all of them. I suspect Yury can do 2) quite quickly, but I agree it's not worth doing if no one wants to step up.</p>",
