I think the first run failed due to disconnection; the second time it ran for 2 hours before I canceled, thinking it silently disconnected; the third time it ran for 5 hours before I again canceled, thinking it must surely fix itself; this is the fourth run and it's been almost 6 hours. I've never seen a linting step take more than 45 minutes or so. Any diagnosis or help is appreciated.</p>",
