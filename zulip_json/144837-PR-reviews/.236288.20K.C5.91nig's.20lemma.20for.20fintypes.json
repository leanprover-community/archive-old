It's a corollary to another theorem, but the proof is a lot of nothing (just universe wrangling).</p>\n<p>It would be make sense to eventually change everything to be in terms of cofiltered limits rather than inverse limits, and I think that will clean up the incidental complexity.  The main issue seems to be that having the theorems take a directed system as a functor from a <code>directed_order</code> makes things less flexible -- the functor wants a specific category structure, rather than, say, the one from <code>ulift</code>.  (I just don't have time right now to do this.)</p>",
