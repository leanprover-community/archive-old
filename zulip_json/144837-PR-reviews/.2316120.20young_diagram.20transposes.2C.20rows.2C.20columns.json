As of a bit more than a week ago, it's just about finished.</p>\n<p>The remaining thing is: I have a draft of a <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/commands.html#mk_simp_attribute\">simp set</a> to prove statements about columns of <code>μ : young_diagram</code> by reducing them to statements about rows of <code>μ.transpose</code>. The simp set works OK but I'm not sure it's worth the extra hassle. Should I post a draft here? Or add it to the PR even though it may not be worth it?</p>",
