What's holding up this PR, and is there anything that can be contributed towards it to help merge it? In general, what's the benefit of it over using <code>vector.of_fn</code> and <code>vector.nth</code> and proving related lemmas in <code>vector</code>? If the two are separate, should similar lemmas and defns like <code>cast</code> be replicated, or should there be a dependency of imports? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110032\">@Reid Barton</span></p>",
