We have lots of <code>ext</code> lemmas here (<code>ext</code> lemmas are usually things like function extensionality: you can prove two things are equal by proving \"their constituent parts\" are equal). In particular for every morphism into a limit (or out of a colimit) we have an extensionality lemma: you can prove two such morphisms are equal by checking their compositions with each projection from the limit object to a point of the diagram are equal.</p>\n<p>This design means we aspire to be able to prove as much as both using <code>by { ext, simp }</code>.
