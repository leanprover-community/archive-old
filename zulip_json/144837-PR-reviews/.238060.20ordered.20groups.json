This is another fairly large PR, of a similar nature to the merged <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7876\">#7876</a>.  In this PR, I used systematically the new typeclasses in the file <code>algebra/ordered_group</code>.</p>\n<p>As you can see, the containment of the spread of the PR now works very well: outside of this file, the only changes are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an instance not found by <code>apply</code> (which likely would have been found by <code>refine</code>, since this is something that I have observed often);</li>\n<li>add two extra <code>_</code> in an <code>@</code>, to fill in the extra typeclasses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While the PR is large, the net effect on the outside is that all the previous lemmas continue to hold, but now with likely weaker assumptions.</p>\n<p>I am not really sure how to break it further: with fewer assumptions, the order in which I reproved the lemmas, and their proofs, changed.  For this reason, I do not know how to break this PR into shorter pieces.</p>",
