In theory, this should be very efficient, because you can just use all of the <code>is_limit</code>/<code>limit</code> lemmas when working with equalizers and avoid specializing the API to all of the shapes. When I first learned the limits API, I thought this was a great idea, but when Kevin tried to use the special shapes API, we realised that working with them is actually really hard unless you sit down and thoroughly comprehend all 1000+ lines of (what was then called) <code>limits/limits.lean</code> and therefore knew that what you would expect to be called <code>equalizer.lift_ι</code> is actually called <code>limit.lift_π</code> (of course, <code>simp</code> knew all along, but there are many cases in which this does not really help). In the end, to flatten the learning curve of the special shapes API, we did specialize most of the API to the various shapes (for example in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/2396\">#2396</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/2423\">#2423</a>), hence eliminating much of the (perceived?) advantage of using <code>abbreviation</code>s in the first place (unless there is some other advantage that I'm missing).</p>\n<p>By changing <code>equalizer_subobject</code> into an abbreviation while retaining the API around <code>equalizer_subobject_iso</code> (which continues to be a <code>def</code>), you seem to be proposing a sort of hybrid approach between the two options I mentioned above. I'm curious what your thought process behind this decision was.</p>\n<p>Note: I believe that the question of <code>abbreviation</code> vs <code>def</code> is orthogonal to what I mentioned at <a href=\"#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/homology.20design.20question/near/234636164\">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/homology.20design.20question/near/234636164</a>. What I was trying to say in that thread is that I believe that I hope that with a good generic subobject API it could be possible to work with the limits subobjects without having to deal with <code>underlying_iso</code> (or its descendants like <code>equalizer_subobject_iso</code>) in every statement/proof.</p>",

(I'm trying to slice off pieces of <code>homology2</code> so a PR becomes plausible....)</p>",
