I had overlooked in the previous <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7084\">#7084</a> that this creates problems for <code>abel</code> since the normal form for nat multiplication is not any more <code>•ℕ</code> (which does not exist) but <code>n • ...</code> for a natural <code>n</code>. And <code>abel</code> is confused by this. I had not noticed it in the previous PR for lack of tests showing the issue, but this came up here. So, I added some tests in <code>test/abel.lean</code>, which are now failing. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110049\">@Mario Carneiro</span> , do you think you could fix <code>abel</code> about this (I guess it's just a few lines, but I don't understand its inner workings to do it myself)?</p>",
