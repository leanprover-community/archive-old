I am just recovering from the end of the exam season, so I have not been able to make further progress, but the next step will be for me to look back at my experiments with monotonicity of multiplication by <em>positive/nonnegative</em> elements and finish the refactor across <code>ordered_ring/field</code>.  I hope that these two extra files will be easier to refactor into smaller-sized PRs, since most of the building blocks should already be available.</p>\n<p>I will keep everyone updated!  <span aria-label=\"wink\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f609\" role=\"img\" title=\"wink\">:wink:</span></p>",
