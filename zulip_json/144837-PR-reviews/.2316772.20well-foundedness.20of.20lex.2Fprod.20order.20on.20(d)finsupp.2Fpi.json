This work was motivated by <a href=\"#narrow/stream/217875-Is-there-code-for-X.3F/topic/.22sort.22.20a.20function/near/299256970\">this thread</a>, and settles the <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/data/dfinsupp/order.html#todo\">TODO</a> posed by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"387244\">@YaÃ«l Dillies</span>.</p>\n<p>The essential mathematics and main theorems are all contained in <em>data/dfinsupp/well_founded.lean</em>. However, a total of 11 files are changed/added in this PR so I spin off two PRs:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/16777\">#16777</a> adds two files dfinsupp.ne_locus and dfinsupp.lex which are directly ported from the finsupp counterparts (authored by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"321459\">@Damiano Testa</span>). It also changes two other files: finsupp.lex (including golfs using the more general dfinsupp versions) and pi.lex. The only new materials are two <code>lex_lt_of_lt</code> lemmas for each of pi/finsupp/dfinsupp that relate the product order and the lex order. It also includes the easy PR <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/16740\">#16740</a> which generalizes some linear_order assumptions to partial_order.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/16741\">#16741</a> is an easy PR that shows (&lt;) is well-founded in a preorder iff it's well-founded on its antisymmetrization (a partial order). It overlaps with <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/16720\">#16720</a> because both move <code>relation.fibration</code> to another file.</p>\n<p>Reviews and comments are welcome!</p>",
