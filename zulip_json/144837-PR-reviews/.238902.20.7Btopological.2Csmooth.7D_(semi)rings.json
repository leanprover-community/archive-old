This PR points out that we can unify the definitions of <code>topological_semiring</code> and <code>topological_ring</code>, because every ring that is a topological semiring automatically has continuous negation.</p>\n<p>I propose that we call the new definition <code>topological_ring</code> and <code>smooth_ring</code>. But this means that <code>nnreal</code> will now be a <code>topological_ring</code>. Should I call them <code>topological_semiring</code> and <code>smooth_semiring</code> instead? Most cases of interest will actually be rings. And, after all, we are also calling \"semimodules\" over <code>nat</code> by the name <code>module</code>.</p>",
