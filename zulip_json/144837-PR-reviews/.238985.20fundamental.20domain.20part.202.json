The upper half plane is parametrising elliptic curves with some extra structure (an isomorphism between Z^2 and the first homology of the curve), and what is happening is that the +-1 in SL_2(Z) is fixing the curve and sending the extra structure to minus itself; however this new data is isomorphic to the original data because an elliptic curve is an abelian group and -1 is an automorphism of any abelian group, so the point on the moduli space doesn't move. When one starts building stuff on top of this moduli space one starts to see the effect of the -1 more, but I would say that we are a long way from this right now. There is even a third way to look at things; if you don't keep track of orientation then you end up with an action of GL_2(Z) on the disjoint union of the upper and lower half planes, or of course PGL_2(Z). Mathematically I don't think there will be some natural choice which makes everyone happy all of the time, so perhaps the decision on whether to make SL_2(Z) or PSL_2(Z) act should be made for other reasons (i.e. other design decisions).</p>",
