Instead of resetting things with git, I figured the easier route is to just use <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7448\">#7448</a> for this as well. So if anyone is willing to take another look at the new changes to <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7448\">#7448</a>, that would be helpful! It's not that many changes really...</p>\n<p>I've cleaned up the PR itself a bit. The only change which is maybe not so obvious to see in the code itself is that I renamed <code>topology/category/Profinite.lean</code> to <code>topology/category/Profinite/default.lean</code>, as this PR also introduces a new file <code>topology/category/Profinite/as_limit.lean</code>.</p>",
