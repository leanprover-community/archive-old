I want to do a depth first search of the space of possible applications, where at each stage the lemmas as sorted according to their \"number of open arguments\", where \"open arguments\" just means an argument that would create a subgoal when the lemma is applied. (This is more or less the same as the number of arguments which could not be made implicit!) This ensures that if it is ever possible to actually close a goal immediately, we will investigate that before applying lemmas that would create a further subgoal. It also means it's possible to use transitivity lemmas (e.g. <code>category.comp</code>) in <code>back</code>, but as these typically produce at least 3 new subgoals, they will only be explored \"as last resorts\".</p>",
