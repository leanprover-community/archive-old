Here \"rank\" means the supremum of cardinalities of linearly independent sets.</p>\n<p>Many results (e.g. injective or surjective linear maps give inequalities on the ranks of source and target) generalise to modules over arbitrary rings, while other results require the rank condition, the strong rank condition, or invariant basis number. (All commutative rings, and all noetherian rings, have these properties, so these results are still very general.)</p>\n<p>Very few results now require that the ring is a division ring (vector spaces are isomorphic iff they have the same dimension) or that it is a field (the rank-nullity theorem).</p>\n<p>Many of the results which have been generalised required new proofs --- we previously happily used the rank-nullity theorem in places where it isn't really needed.</p>",

Further, much of the theory of finite-dimensional vector spaces also generalises. I'm not planning on tackling either of these now, but if someone would like to that would be great!</p>",
