Did they give up?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I did do it in a slightly convoluted manner in <a href=\"https://github.com/ADedecker/gauss\">https://github.com/ADedecker/gauss</a> using parametric integrals, but that was before you did the proper version so I was using an epsilon-delta version that I just translated from a course without thinking about generalizations (and oh god does that proof looks horrible). This was the motivation for all the \"improper integral\" stuff I did at the beginning of last summer (which was arguably way harder than it should've been because it was the first time I heard of the dominated convergence theorem), but I've never really tried to update the proof using the mathlib theorem for derivation of parametric integrals. But anyway, I think it's better to have this straightforward version, and it's a good test case for the change of variable API</p>",
