There was a suggestion by Neil:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I would vote for using the more constructive and logically elementary versions of these concepts. A commutative ring is local iff <code>(1 : A) ≠ 0 ∧ ∀ (a : A), (is_unit a) ∨ (is_unit (1 - a))</code>. An element <code>a : A</code> lies in the Jacobson radical iff <code>∀ (x : A), is_unit (1 + a * x)</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The change to local rings has been made. Do you want to make the change to the definition of the Jacobson radical?</p>",
