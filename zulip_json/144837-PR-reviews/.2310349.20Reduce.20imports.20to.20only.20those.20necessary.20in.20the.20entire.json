Maybe its possible to just do everything at the end instead?

Have you tried reducing imports yourself? What happens most often is that the transitive imports in intermediate files clutter your imports list and you take 10 more minutes to reduce them to bits.<br>\nThe fast way of reducing imports is to replace them by their imports (if <code>A</code> imports <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>, you replace <code>import A</code> by <code>import B import C</code>). Transitive imports break that as you can replace them by their imports all the way down (if <code>A</code> imports <code>B</code> and <code>B</code> imports <code>C</code>, you can replace <code>B</code> by <code>C</code> and <code>C</code> by its imports, etc... and never notice that <code>B</code> was not even needed in the first place).
