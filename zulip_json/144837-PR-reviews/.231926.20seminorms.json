Does that sound reasonable?</p>\n<p>(I'm currently making an effort to get this up to date and into a state that's ready for review / merging, but mathlib has moved to 3.5.1 in the meantime and I will first have to spend some time building lean again, so it might be a few days before the WIP label can be gone. Hope that's okay &amp; sorry for the delay.)</p>",
