I haven't touched the <code>C_mul_X_pow_eq_monomial</code> since it seems like it has bigger problems. For example, it is suspiciously similar to the <code>single_eq_C_mul_X</code> lemma. It seems cleaner that <code>single_eq_C_mul_X</code> should be renamed <code>monomial_eq_C_mul_X_pow</code> and all instances of <code>C_mul_X_pow_eq_monomial</code> should just be replaced by <code>&lt;-monomial_eq_C_mul_X_pow</code>. Does this seem reasonable? If so, which of <code>C_mul_X_pow_eq_monomial</code> or <code>monomial_eq_C_mul_X_pow</code> should be the name that survives? Should a new PR be started for this?</p>",
