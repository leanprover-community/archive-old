But that will require some work, because it might break the subsequent proofs in the files, like <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/topology/instances/ennreal.lean#L338-L340\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/topology/instances/ennreal.lean#L338-L340\">here</a>.
