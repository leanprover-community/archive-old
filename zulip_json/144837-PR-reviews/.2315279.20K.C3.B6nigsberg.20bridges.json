So perhaps the more Eulerian way to model it would be a simple graph for the underlying connectivity and then look for walks whose edges are some specific multiset, rather than using multigraphs.</p>\n<p>I can't possibly speak for Euler, but I imagine if we had the opportunity to ask him his opinion he'd wonder why the argument in this PR doesn't resolve the Konigsberg bridges problem.</p>",
