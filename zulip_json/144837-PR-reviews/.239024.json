        "content": "<p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/9024\">#9024</a>, I propose refactoring some of the algebra files that deal with <code>ordered_{monoid,group,ring,field}</code> and related files into their own <code>algebra/order</code> folder. I think that doing so will make it easier organizationally to provide the <code>complete_lattice</code> versions of the hierarchy (and the in-between), than adding more \"top-level\" files into <code>algrebra/</code>. This is related to the discussion <a href=\"#narrow/stream/217875-Is-there.20code.20for.20X.3F/topic/complete_linear_ordered_add_comm_monoid\">here</a> and elsewhere. Is this a reasonable or too large a change?</p>",
