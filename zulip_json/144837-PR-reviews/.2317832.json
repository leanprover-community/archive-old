More and more people coming to the opinion that mathlib3 PRs (other than those which actively help with the port to mathlib4) are in some sense now a step in the wrong direction; maintainers are spending less time reviewing mathlib3 PRs and more time porting files to mathlib4. Any new PR to mathlib3 is just making the port harder. In a parallel universe mathlib3 got frozen and no more PRs are now allowed; right now we're trying not to freeze it and port it simultaneously, and we're still just about managing to do this, but already some PRs were  drowned by the rising tide, and the situation will only get worse as the tide rises further. The problem is that mathlib3 is kind of a cool hobby for lots of people, but a bunch of people are planning on teaching using mathlib4 in January, so there are some very concrete porting goals which need to be focussed on by the community which is driving resources away from mathlib3.</p>",

As it is now, it is not so clear what people like me (i.e., wanting to expand the library, but due to whatever reasons not being able to help with the port at this point) are expected to do.</p>\n<p>The freezing option is certainly the cleanest way of proceeding, but may be frustrating for people who'd like to contribute. The status quo is also frustrating, because there is not enough maintainer bandwith to deal with mathlib3 PRs, but this has not been communicated clearly (at least as far as I can remember). I find it hard to say what the less bad option is. Maybe freeze the part of mathlib that needs to be ported so that one can reasonably teach with it, and announce that mathlib3 PRs will not get much attention until after this has been done?</p>\n<p>In any case, I'd like to stress that I think that you (i.e., everybody involved in the port) are doing a marvelous job!</p>",

Part of the difficulty is that even with many people working hard on this its still not clear how long the process will take, whether it will speed up or slow down as time goes on, and this will of course impact the strategy porting takes going forward.</p>",
