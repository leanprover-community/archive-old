I also port the basic API on well-founded relations to these new typeclasses, but I don't yet use them - that's for followup PRs.</p>\n<p>I know that unbundled typeclasses are kind of controversial, but I truly believe this will make our life easier in a bunch of ways. I even wrote a few paragraphs about that on the PR itself.</p>\n<p>Would be nice to know what you think.</p>",
