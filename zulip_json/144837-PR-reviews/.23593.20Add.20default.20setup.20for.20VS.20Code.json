The things I use most often is my <code>proof</code> snippet that I posted last week, and snippets that write options for me, like <code>#implicit</code> that writes <code>\"set_option pp.implicit true</code>. An important thing while choosing the prefix is to choose something that we wouldn't normally type, so that the snippet is VScode's first proposal. For instance <code>begin</code> is not a good prefix in order to insert a proof snippet because VScode then has to choose between completing the word \"begin\" and inserting the prefix. That's why I started my set_option prefixes <code>#implicit</code>, <code>#rewrite</code>, <code>#all</code>, <code>#instance</code> with a \"#\".</p>",
