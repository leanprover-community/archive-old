The new file <code>linear_algebra/matrix/sesquilinear_form</code> was copied from <code>linear_algebra/matrix/bilinear_form</code> and every lemma was changed to curried form of bilinear forms and generalized when it was easily possible (mainly done in the <code>to_matrix'</code> section and not in the <code>to_matrix</code> section).</p>",
