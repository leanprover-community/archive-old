And from it I understand that \"I don't see any corresponding issues locally\" was not strictly true: I have recently had to merge master very often to get a cache with which I don't have the orange bars. So I now think these are related, although I still don't really understand what's going on.</p>\n<p>But thanks, great news about the upgrade!</p>",
