This PR defines a tactic called <code>compute_degree_le</code>: if the target is of the form <code>(nat_)degree f â‰¤ d</code>, then the tactic tries to prove the goal.</p>\n<p>It works with polynomials <code>f</code> that are expressed as sums, differences, products of constants, monomials, powers of <code>X</code> and numerals.</p>\n<p>The PR leads to <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14040\">#14040</a>, which is currently WIP, due to some unexplained universe issues interacting with <code>norm_num</code>.</p>\n<p>If anyone has any comments on the simpler PR <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14762\">#14762</a>, I would be very grateful!</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
