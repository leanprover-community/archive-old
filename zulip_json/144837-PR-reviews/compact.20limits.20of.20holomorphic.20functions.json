OTOH his PR introduces some API for circle integrals which would be desirable for other things, typically proving Cauchy's formulas for higher derivatives. So we reached a proposal: I leave my PR now in the review process, he keeps the circle integral API from his, and we try to get all that into mathlib.</p>\n<p>Does that sound reasonable? <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"246273\">@Bhavik Mehta</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"268315\">@Anatole Dedecker</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"474023\">@Kevin Wilson</span></p>",
