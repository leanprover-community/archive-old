We though Lean might be more interesting than just going over a computer algebra system, and it might be more of a level starting point since Lean could be quite different to the sorts of languages the students are most likely to have met before.</p>\n<p>David and I are just starting out learning Lean ourselves, so the course will be very student led and collaborative. A reasonable goal for the course would be that participants learn how to interact with the Lean environment, and to access the existing library of mathematics, and that by the end we are able to venture into proving new theorems (i.e. translating known theorems from our discipline) into the library. So we will probably start with some tutorials and then move more towards some project-based work.</p>\n<p>We are still at the stage of planning how exactly the course will run. I wanted to touch base here since I'm aware, via Jon Eugster, that there are quite a few Lean experts mainly based in Informatics. Let me know if you have any thoughts, suggestions for teaching, project ideas, or any other interest in this pilot course.</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Patrick</p>",
