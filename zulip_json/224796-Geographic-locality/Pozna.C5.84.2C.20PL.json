I have just found out about the existence of Lean and other theorem provers yesterday and I am really excited about the topic.  I have a strong background in programming (currently working in ML for a medical applications) but I miss more scientific, \"low-level\" work and I love mathematics.  I love to tackle problems at a deep basic level. I taught calculus on various levels during my PhD and enjoyed it a lot. </p>\n<p>It seems that there are not many people from my country here but maybe someday... It would be really amazing to create an on-site-meeting group. For now, luckily there is Internet.</p>",

I have seen you enrolled in our Lean in Lyon workshop in a month time, or so, and I hope you will find it interesting. In the meantime, you will find a lot of nice and helpful people around.

I have already found lots of interesting material here and on the leanprover community. I am amazed how much has been done already. I installed Lean 4 yesterday and I am currently working through \"Theorem Proving in Lean 4\" but I will surely try to play the game as well.</p>",

There is a definitive plan to port everything to Lean 4, but for the time being most of the community is still working on Lean 3.</p>",
