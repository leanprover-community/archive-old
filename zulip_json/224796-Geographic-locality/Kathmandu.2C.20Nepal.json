I also studied some physics and sometimes study some computer science on the internet. Recently, I watched Bob Harper's class on Homotopy Type Theory recorded at CMU. I am now going through LftCM2020 videos and will go through Lean Summer Lectures to understand and practice lean a bit more. It's really nice to have an active community! I am really interested in topics in algebraic geometry and more generally ideas that build on algebra, topology and category theory.</p>",
