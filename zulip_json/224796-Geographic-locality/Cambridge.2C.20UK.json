(Most meetings will be in person only, but whenever the speaker is remote, it will be possible to participate virtually too).<br>\nThis is a joint seminar series between the Department of Computer Science and Technology and the Faculty of Mathematics, on the fast-growing area of formalisation of mathematics with proof assistants (interactive theorem provers) such as Isabelle and Lean. All levels welcome. Undergraduate students are particularly encouraged to actively participate.<br>\nOur first speaker opening the series is Professor Lawrence C. Paulson: \"Formalised Mathematics: Obstacles and Achievements\".<br>\nYou can find the schedule and relevant information at the link below :<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.talks.cam.ac.uk/show/index/164015\">http://www.talks.cam.ac.uk/show/index/164015</a><br>\nPlease feel free to invite any colleagues who may be interested.<br>\nHope to see many of you!</p>",
