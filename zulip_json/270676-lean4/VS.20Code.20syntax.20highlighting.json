For instance the default Light+ theme uses color <code>#001080</code> for variables. This is awfully close to <code>#000000</code> that is used as the default text color. This makes it very easy to miss an accidental use of auto bound implicit arguments. For instance in</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">def</span> <span class=\"n\">my_id</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">nat</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>maybe <code>nat</code> is a typo and <code>Nat</code> was intended. If your color theme is good enough then you should see that <code>n</code> and <code>nat</code> have the same color since they are both marked as variables by semantic highlighting.</p>\n</blockquote>",
