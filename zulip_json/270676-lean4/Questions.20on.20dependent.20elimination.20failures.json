        "content": "<p>That's fair of course, I would just say the paper is wrong on this aspect. (It's old and probably the first time anyone tried to do category theory in type theory.) Their motivation is that they want to state functor equality <code>F = G</code> as <code>forall f, F f ~~ G f</code>, which doesn't work unless <code>forall A, F A = G A</code> definitionally. But this can be solved by using a different definition of functor equality: <code>F = G</code> iff (a) <code>forall A, F A ~= G A</code>, where the <code>~=</code> is isomorphism in the target category; and (b) <code>forall (f : A -&gt; B), F f ~~ i^-1 . G f . i</code>, where <code>i</code> is the isomorphism from (a), <code>.</code> is composition and <code>~~</code> is (setoid) equality of arrows. So you use the isomorphism on objects to 'fix up' the typing for the equality on arrows. Then you can rewrite condition (b) to <code>forall (f : A -&gt; B), i . F f = G f . i</code> to discover that <code>i</code> is a natural iso, so equality on functors is just natural isomorphism. I wrote this up in Agda at some point, with the definition of natural iso <a href=\"https://github.com/JLimperg/cats/blob/master/Cats/Trans/Iso.agda\">here</a> and the category of small categories <a href=\"https://github.com/JLimperg/cats/blob/master/Cats/Category/Cat.agda\">here</a>. (I only dabble as well, btw, so grain of salt and all.)</p>\n<p>For more professional libraries, look at <a href=\"https://github.com/jwiegley/category-theory\">this</a> in Coq, <a href=\"https://github.com/agda/agda-categories\">this</a> in Agda, or of course our own <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/category_theory.Cat.category\">docs#category_theory.Cat.category</a> in Lean 3.</p>",
