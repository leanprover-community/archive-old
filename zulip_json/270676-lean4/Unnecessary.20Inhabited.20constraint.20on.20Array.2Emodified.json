Has there already been debate for/against there being an <code>Array.modify</code> primitive that is linear without requiring <code>Inhabited</code>? I feel like for the \"unsafe\" version (i.e., <code>modify!</code>) it is obviously not of an issue because the inhabited constraint is already their for type system soundness, but if the index is provably valid, it would be neat if you could update-and-replace the value. Morally the element type doesn't _need_ to be inhabited it feels like anyway.</p>",
