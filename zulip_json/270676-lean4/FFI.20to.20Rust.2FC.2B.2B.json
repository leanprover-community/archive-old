        "content": "<p>No. When you compile lean code and you tag a declaration with <code>@[export]</code> you can know the symbol name in advance, furthermore you can also deduce the C type of the function in advance based on our FFI. Since you can do this you can also automatically decude a Rust representation of any Lean type automatically (based on #[repr(C)], however many lean types will end up being lean_object*. For that you can define type aliases + wrapper functions to allocate and pattern match on stuff). So in theory I believe it should be possible to automatically generate a <code>.rs</code> file using a Lean program that reads some other Lean file and exposes all of the functions tagged with <code>export</code> in that Lean file to Rust + at least working representation of all Lean types defined in that file in Rust. I don't think that representation and the way you interact with it will necessarily end up being safe but it should in general be possible.</p>",
