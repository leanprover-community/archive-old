If you want that level of support, it is best to stick with Lean 3 for now. As <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"395550\">@Henrik Böving</span> ,you can add mathlib4 as a dependency if you want to get the <code>ℕ</code> notation. Note, though, that mathlib4 is not a complete port of mathlib yet, so it will be missing out on a lot theorems / tactics / etc. that you may want.</p>",
