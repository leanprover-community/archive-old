From what I can tell, a <code>ParserDescr</code> is a utility object generated by the <code>syntax</code> DSL to summarize the essence of a grammar so that, in addition to a <code>Parser</code>, things like a <code>Parenthesizer</code> can be generated from the specification. Is this right? Or is there some more important distinction between <code>Parser</code> and <code>ParserDescr</code> that I am missing?</p>",
