On <code>stdlib</code>, it seems to provide a perf delta of <code>speed up =     12.42%</code>.  Can I invoke <code>!bench</code> on <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/727\">the PR I created?</a>? In general, if I sent a performance-related PR, can I invoke <code>!bench</code> on it?</p>\n<p>I don't want to be a nuisance. But I'm not sure if I'm running the bench suite correctly, so having the CI run the bench for me would be super useful.</p>",
