The relevant <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/e20a07bd6dd030cd94d42c240dd97310fa409c4f/src/kernel/inductive.cpp#L341\">code snippet</a> however has an extra case with a different error exception for a non-positive occurrence of the data type.</p>\n<p>I'm particularly curious why the equivalent code for both options work in Coq and don't work here. It can't be some fundamental reason, since they both are based on the same CoIC, right? So I'm probably misunderstanding some syntax or something similar? Can someone here enlighten me a bit?
