The mechanism for storing ESModules in the server and providing a way for the JS side to retrieve them is one level of abstraction lower and works with \"widget <em>sources</em>\".  Have a look <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/75f8ebdd199f181e8709c69d478d706b2c33fa26/src/Lean/Widget/UserWidget.lean#L58\">here</a> which should hopefully make the difference a bit clearer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>and could be used for ESModules don't export react components, or that export react components that are not yet full top-level widgets</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed the <code>widgetSourceRegistry</code> is not at all specific to top-level components; it is nothing more than a hash-addressed <code>String</code> storage. If you want, you can store any data there using <code>widgetSourceRegistry.addEntry</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/75f8ebdd199f181e8709c69d478d706b2c33fa26/src/Lean/Widget/UserWidget.lean#L82\">this</a> is what the <code>@[widget]</code> attribute does) and retrieve it using the <code>getWidgetSource</code> RPC call. The reason why we didn't generalize it to <code>generalStringStorage</code> is pretty much just that anyone who needs a storage for things that aren't widget sources (and in particular might have different types than <code>String</code>) can quite easily add it by registering a new environment extension, so no generality is lost. I think the option to generalize is still open, but again it is not very high priority because Lean core already gives you all that you need to store arbitrary data in this way.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(BTW, why does <code>getWidgetSource</code> have to look at the <code>pos</code>? Can’t you have a global <code>widgetSourceRegistry</code>?)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All RPC calls are made relative to a position and we think of them as executing <em>at</em> that position. For example in</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"c1\">-- line 30</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">@[widget]</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">def</span> <span class=\"n\">myWidget</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">UserWidgetDefinition</span> <span class=\"n\">where</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">name</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"Hello\"</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">javascript</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"bp\">...</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">-- line 35</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>calling <code>getWidgetSource(myWidgetHash)</code> at line 35 succeeds whereas on line 30 it would fail.</p>",
