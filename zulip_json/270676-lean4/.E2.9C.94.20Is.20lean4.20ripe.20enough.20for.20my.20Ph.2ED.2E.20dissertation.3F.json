So far, I have been studying lean3 only. I don't know how much better lean4 is going to be, how stable and useful it is already, and what are the prospects of mathlib4.</p>",

So I would say, use lean 3, wait for things to stabilize to the point that porting is commonplace and large parts of mathlib are ported already, and then do your own porting. Or not, just stay in lean 3 and deliver the dissertation there. You won't get much accolades from porting your work or using beta software, so there isn't much sense in being an early adopter.</p>",
