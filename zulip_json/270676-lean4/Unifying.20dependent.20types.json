Specifically assume I have the constructor <code>T (n : nat)</code> and want to show the equality of <code>T (a + (b + c))</code> and <code>T ((a + b) + c)</code> (see <a href=\"https://leanprover.github.io/live/latest/#code=inductive%20Test%20(n%20:%20nat)%0A%7C%20T%20:%20Test%0A%0Adef%20eqT%20%7Bn%20:%20nat%7D%20(t1%20:%20Test%20n)%20(t2%20:%20Test%20n)%20:=%20true.%0A%0Atheorem%20test%20(a%20b%20c%20:%20nat)%20:%20eqT%20(Test.T%20(a%20+%20(b%20+%20c)))%20(Test.T%20((a%20+%20b)%20+%20c))%20:=%20sorry\">this playground</a>). In the Coq world I could define a program lemma, where I could prove the equivalence of the dependent arguments for the types. How would I go about handling this in Lean 4?</p>",

This is a real Achilles heel in lean and I had expected things to be the same in Coq. I have no idea what \"define a program lemma\" means and would be happy to hear more. In the liquid tensor experiment we usually don't attempt to use the resulting equalities, we define isomorphisms from T(x) to T(x') if x=x' and train the simplifier to cancel these isomorphisms when it can. Why do you need the equalities?</p>",

In effect a program lemma generates a lemma that makes use of eq_rect and carries a proof term of the equalities, similar to what was suggested in this thread. Here's the (admittedly, sparse) documentation <a href=\"https://coq.inria.fr/refman/addendum/program.html\">https://coq.inria.fr/refman/addendum/program.html</a>. And it's a bummer that Lean doesn't support this. In an ideal world it would be great, if one could first prove the dependent types equal and if that's the case proceed to prove the two statements in equal. Would such a feature cause any undesirable side effects?</p>",
