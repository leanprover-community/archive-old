        "content": "<p>I am looking to verify a result that was proven with a SAT solver. The SAT formula was generated with a moderately complex python script, making it difficult to ascertain whether unsatisfiability result corresponds to the desired theorem.</p>\n<p>Ideally, the proof of the theorem would be entirely self contained—including the generation of the SAT formula and the call to the SAT solver. However, it appears that Lean does not have direct integration with SAT solvers (although Isabelle appears to have such capability?). The next best thing would be to write a program in Lean (or Coq?) that generates the SAT formula and then use program verification to show that the unsatisfiability of the formula implies the impossibility theorem. Presumably this would be done by defining a type for CNF formulae and writing the program to generate an instance of that type. The SAT formula and the data used to construct it are quite lengthy, so I am unsure if Lean program verification would be the best approach. I see that there is a <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"236449\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/236449-Program-verification\">#Program verification</a> channel but I can seem to find little information online about how to properly verify programs in Lean. </p>\n<p>So, in short, how would you suggest going about the verification of such a result? Are there existing (verified) tools that unroll finite quantifiers in Lean to produce SAT formulae? </p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>",
