I like to keep project substituters local so that nixos doesn't check project caches for every package in my nixos config. It turns out you can also temporarily turn on all the other options listed.</p>\n<p>Not sure who to ping, but would the lean4 developers be open to the following PR? I just c/p'd the getting started code block. I also noticed that unexpected pull requests (like this one) should be asked for on Zulip. <br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/compare/master...stites:lean4:patch-1\">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/compare/master...stites:lean4:patch-1</a></p>\n<p>Could people point me in the direction of the right folks to ping for this?</p>",
