He reported this issue to me on the Lake GitHub (see <a href=\"https://github.com/tydeu/lean4-lake/issues/3\">#3</a>). I reproduced this (it hangs for me) and discovered it also occurs with later versions (such as the <code>07-28</code> nightly).</p>\n<p>I suspect this is because the Lean version Lake is built with is different from the  Lean version of the <code>.oleans</code> Lake finds in its search path while interpreting the config file. If I am correct about this, would it be feasible for Lean to save some kind of version information in an <code>.olean</code> about the Lean version it was built with and verify that it matches the running Lean version when imported?  Though, honestly, anything would be better than the current behavior of a hang/segfault. <span aria-label=\"wink\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f609\" role=\"img\" title=\"wink\">:wink:</span></p>",
