It has type classes for single digits (ex. <code>Zero</code> and <code>One</code>), expands multi-digit literals to array of digit (making it easier to support types that work better with positional notation), and preserves the radix of a literal when pretty printing. Some of its ideas may be of use to the <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"287929\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/287929-mathlib4\">#mathlib4</a> community based on what I gleaned from the discussions in <a href=\"#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/mathport.3Anumbers/near/231530734\">mathport:numbers</a>. </p>\n<p>Regardless, I felt these kinds of tiny metaprogramming package might be something worth sharing on here, so I am doing just that. I also do hope that this kind of self-promotion is okay. If not, my apologies!</p>",
