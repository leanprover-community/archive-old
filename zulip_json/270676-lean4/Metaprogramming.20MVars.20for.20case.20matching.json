I'm currently working on a tactic (to be implemented as editor suggestions later) that attempts to auto-complete cases and induction statements, with some extra bells and whistles. My current implementation already produces in the (very trivial) example:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">example</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">Nat</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"kd\">by</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">myTactic</span> <span class=\"n\">induction</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span>\n  <span class=\"c1\">-- suggests</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">induction</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"k\">with</span>\n  <span class=\"bp\">|</span> <span class=\"n\">zero</span> <span class=\"bp\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"gr\">sorry</span>\n  <span class=\"bp\">|</span> <span class=\"n\">succ</span> <span class=\"n\">n_1</span> <span class=\"n\">n_1.ih</span> <span class=\"bp\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"gr\">sorry</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>For some other suggestions and improvements I want to make, I need access to the state/MVarId at the start of the case block in the <code>inductionAlt</code> (before execution of either <code>sorry</code>). Is there a canonical way of getting these mvars, given the MVarId prior to the cases? Note that we can't seem to use the cases without the match statement, because then we don't get the goals with their declarations named as in <code>succ n_1</code>.</p>",

The only caveat is that in its current form it's a manual operation (e.g. write <code>myTactic induction n</code>, then copy and paste the suggestion from the infoview). I believe <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/1494\">in this RFC</a> people are working on actually implementing a system where these code suggestions can be automated for the user, but for now that's not the case, sadly.</p>",
