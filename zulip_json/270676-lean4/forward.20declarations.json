The file <code>src/Lean/Meta/ExprDefEq.lean</code> is one of the most expensive files to compile. Right now, very few files depend on it because we used the forward declaration hack. This makes my life way more convenient. When I change this file, I don't have to recompile a ton of other files. Without the forward declaration hack, all this code would have to be at <code>src/Lean/Meta/Basic.lean</code>. <br>\nMutual definitions have the other minor and more general performance problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They are treated as a single command. Any modification will force the server to recompile the whole block from scratch. </li>\n<li>If we are not using <code>partial</code>, then we also have the overhead of combining all definitions into a single declaration. If we have hundreds of functions, we will need a big sum type there.</li>\n</ul>",
