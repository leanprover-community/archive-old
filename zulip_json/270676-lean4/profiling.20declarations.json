In Lean 3 <code>set_option profiler true</code> would do this, and this still works in Lean 4 but it doesn't seem to tell me e.g. how long it just took to run <code>instance foo : ...</code>, and hover seems to indicate that it profiles tactics and <code>#eval</code> in Lean 4. How do I recover what we had in Lean 3?</p>",
