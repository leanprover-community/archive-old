How would I go about it?</p>\n<p>It seems to be attempting to download from a very peculiar place: <a href=\"https://github.com/cognivore/lean4/releases/expanded_assets/alt-backend\">https://github.com/cognivore/lean4/releases/expanded_assets/alt-backend</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, I don't quite understand if I need to provide it with binary releases or is it possible to have <code>lake</code> call <code>elan</code> to compile <code>lean</code> somehow. Sorry for silly questions, I'll read the code of the corresponding tools, but perhaps someone knows off the bat how to develop in a fork.</p>",
