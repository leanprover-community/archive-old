But today we have a <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69689224/how-to-use-sockets-in-lean\">question about sockets in Lean 4</a> and I don't know if the Lean 4 community have their eyes on this in one form or another so I thought I'd flag it here. If I'm online and one of these easy Lean 3 questions pops up I typically drop what I'm doing and answer it because not everybody is going to want to make an account on Zulip just to get their easy question answered. Sometimes we answer \"just come to Zulip and get real time help\" if it's a \"big\" question but often nowadays the questions are relatively easy to deal with on SO. None of them ever get more than one or two upvotes of course, but I think this is inevitable with a small language.</p>",
