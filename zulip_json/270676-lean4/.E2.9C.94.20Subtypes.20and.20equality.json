In the cardinality model of Lean's type theory the subtypes might be equal simply because they have the same size.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was afraid of that -- the whole time it felt a bit strange since we usually talk about equality of terms and not types, but I guess it's good to have confirmation that using it this way isn't really intended.</p>",
