When porting Algebra.Free (see PR <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/1353\">mathlib4#1353</a>), the line <code>attribute [match_pattern] Mul.mul</code> causes the error  <code>invalid attribute 'match_pattern', declaration is in an imported module</code>. This apparently worked in lean 3, but I'm guessing it does not like adding attributes to declarations in other files anymore. Would it be a desirable fix to add this attribute to <code>Mul.mul</code> (or <code>HMul.hmul</code>?) in Init.Prelude? Or should we try to avoid that and find a local solution?</p>\n<p>EDIT: See also the discussion in <a href=\"#narrow/stream/287929-mathlib4/topic/Algebra.2EFree\">this thread</a>.</p>",
