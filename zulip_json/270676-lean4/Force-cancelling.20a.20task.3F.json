The function <code>IO.cancel task</code> requires that <code>task</code> cooperates and handles its own <code>IO.checkCanceled</code>. Currently my <code>task</code> is <code>IO.asTask &lt;| IO.Process.run someProcess</code> and there's no simple way (AFAIK) to check for the cancellation request. I basically run a couple of processes and want to cancel the ones that don't terminate within a given timeout, as I am not interested in their outputs thereafter.</p>\n<p>EDIT: I still don't know how to force-cancel a process, but I implemented a simple workaround that calls <code>Task.spawn</code> and handles timeouts explicitly / gets cancelled cooperatively with <code>IO.cancel</code>, a'la <code>IO.Process.runWithTimeout</code>.</p>",
