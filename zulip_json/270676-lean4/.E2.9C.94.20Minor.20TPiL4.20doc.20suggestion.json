We have this in TPIL because we are running a nightly build of TPIL to test the latest nightly build of lean4 to make sure we find any breaks affecting in the book, and on the github build machines the lean-toolchain string <code>leanprover/lean4:nightly</code> works great because it picks up the latest build without any version number finagling in the CI workflow.  The downside is on a dev machines is that version <code>leanprover/lean4:nightly</code> is pinned to whenever you first installed it, unless you do an <code>elan update</code>.   It's nice that there is an <code>elan update</code>, I only recently discovered that option myself :-)</p>",
