At the moment, the Lean mathematics community is mostly still focussed on Lean 3, although we are hard at work at moving everything to Lean 4. So if you want to do mathematics in Lean, then I would recommend the Lean 3 (community edition). If you want to program in Lean, and have your programs run quickly, then Lean 4 would be a better choice since its programming capabilities are much better.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Most of the learning material is focused on Lean 3 at the moment.
