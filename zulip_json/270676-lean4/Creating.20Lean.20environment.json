This was based on an email thread with Adam Chlipala, so our interests may overlap.  Another option is to script Lean itself, but that has startup and parsing overhead. <br>\nThere are other uses potentially, e.g., I could use it to build a specialized compiler for some declarations.  I known the Lean server and Lean itself have to do this, but that code was a bit complex for me to navigate initially.  I'll probably do some more reading when I have time if there isn't a simple solution that I am overlooking.</p>",

Indeed, they have proven very useful for testing (in our case we were testing theorem proving AIs which generate proofs using only the premises available in the environment before that declaration was proved).  I highly suspect these tricks were not ported to Lean 4, nor will they be, so I'd be curious to know if there is a more canonical way in Lean 4.</p>",
