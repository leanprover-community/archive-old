I don't use a <code>Main.lean</code> file and that seems to work with vscode, but if I run lake from the command line it complains:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"error\"><pre><span></span><code>  file: ././Main.lean\nerror: build failed\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Does lake <em>require</em> a file named Main.lean? Or can I have an alternative name? There's no <code>Main.lean</code> anywhere in the configuration file, where does lake get that name from? It seems like it was hardcoded into lake.</p>",
