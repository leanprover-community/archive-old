This helps me keep the text up to date with compiler and library changes.</p>\n<p>However, using <code>#check</code> with (say) <code>List.length</code> yields output like: <code>List.length : List ?m.10389 â†’ Nat</code>. The specific number chosen for the meta is not easily predictable, and inserting new definitions earlier in the file changes the number.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to temporarily locally override the gensym counter? That seems likely to introduce subtle elaborator bugs, so I suspect not :-)</p>\n<p>I suppose I could also make a new macro that takes a \"message spec\" regexp and then requires that the example string and the compiler output match the regexp. Do we have a regexp library for Lean 4 yet?</p>",
