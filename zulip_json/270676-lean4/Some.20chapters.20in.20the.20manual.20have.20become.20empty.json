However the source file <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/master/doc/monads/transformers.lean\">transformers.lean</a> in the repo is indeed full of useful content.<br>\nI have tried to build the documentation from source with the same results.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know why this is the case? Is it something strange with the build process or was the content so bad that it was better being removed?</p>",
