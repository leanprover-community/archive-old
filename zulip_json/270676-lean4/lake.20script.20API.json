So I thought of having <code>lake script foo</code> again (like we had before) and <code>lake scripts</code> as the call to list available scripts and their docstrings in a single command.</p>\n<p>I also think that having all scripts in the <code>lakefile.lean</code> file can become a bit crowded, so my other idea is being able to implement scripts in their own files, which can be located in a customizable folder (default = <code>scripts</code>). Or, heck, being able to link to scripts from other repositories would be cool too :D</p>\n<p>What do you guys think?</p>",

Primarily this part:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Resurrect the old <code>lake script foo</code> as the command to run the script <code>foo</code></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The old command was <code>lake run foo</code>, which I would be happy to resurrect as an abbreviation for <code>lake script run</code>. I would also be willing to add a <code>lake scripts</code> as an abbreviation for <code>lake script list</code>. However, I do want to keep more granular <code>lake script &lt;subcommand&gt;</code> around as an option. </p>\n<p>How does that sound?</p>",
