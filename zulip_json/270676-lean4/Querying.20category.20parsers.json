Is that info available?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This can be useful for other reasons. I've observed noticeable slowdown in just a 100x line file when editing, for example, macros in the same file. The server re-computes the entire file one each partial edit, thus often resulting in half-edited macro being processed. This breaks the rest of the file thereby producing tons of errors. This happens multiple times per second and results in input lag while editing the macro in VS Code. I definitely think some level of processing delay for the rest of the file would be desirable. For my case, I know there is the 'elaboration delay' setting, but the problem isn't really elaborating the code under the cursor (which I do want fast feedback for) -- it is the fact that it also re-elaborates the rest of the file each edit that causes problems.</p>",

That is, when, by some heuristic, the server has free time to spare . For example, when there is more than enough free processing power and the server is not currently being requested to do something else.</p>",
