This should be a command macro that takes a command and an expected error as arguments. If the command elaborates successfully, then an error should be thrown. If the command results in an error, then the error should be compared with the expected error. If they are equal, the result of elaboration should be thrown away and nothing more should happen. If they are not equal, then an error should be thrown.</p>\n<p>Here's my quick attempt to make this work:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">Lean</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">syntax</span> <span class=\"n\">withPosition</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">\"expect\"</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"error\"</span> <span class=\"n\">colGt</span> <span class=\"n\">command</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"message\"</span> <span class=\"n\">str</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"end\"</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">command</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">elab_rules</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">command</span>\n  <span class=\"bp\">|</span> <span class=\"bp\">`</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">expect</span> <span class=\"n\">error</span> <span class=\"bp\">$</span><span class=\"n\">cmd</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"n\">command</span> <span class=\"n\">message</span> <span class=\"bp\">$</span><span class=\"n\">msg</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"n\">str</span> <span class=\"kd\">end</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"bp\">=&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"kn\">open</span> <span class=\"n\">Lean.Elab.Command</span> <span class=\"k\">in</span>\n    <span class=\"kn\">open</span> <span class=\"n\">Lean.Meta</span> <span class=\"k\">in</span> <span class=\"k\">do</span>\n      <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"n\">savedState</span> <span class=\"bp\">&lt;-</span> <span class=\"n\">get</span>\n      <span class=\"n\">try</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">elabCommandTopLevel</span> <span class=\"n\">cmd</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">throwError</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"no error\"</span>\n      <span class=\"n\">catch</span> <span class=\"n\">ex</span> <span class=\"bp\">=&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">match</span> <span class=\"n\">msg.isStrLit</span><span class=\"bp\">?</span> <span class=\"k\">with</span>\n          <span class=\"bp\">|</span> <span class=\"n\">none</span> <span class=\"bp\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">throwError</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"Invalid message format {msg}, expected a string literal\"</span>\n          <span class=\"bp\">|</span> <span class=\"n\">some</span> <span class=\"n\">str</span> <span class=\"bp\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"k\">do</span>\n            <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"n\">foundString</span> <span class=\"bp\">&lt;-</span> <span class=\"n\">ex.toMessageData.toString</span>\n            <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">str</span> <span class=\"bp\">==</span> <span class=\"n\">foundString</span>\n              <span class=\"k\">then</span> <span class=\"n\">return</span> <span class=\"o\">()</span>\n              <span class=\"k\">else</span> <span class=\"n\">throwError</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"Expected error {str} but got {foundString}\"</span>\n      <span class=\"n\">finally</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">modify</span> <span class=\"k\">fun</span> <span class=\"n\">s</span> <span class=\"bp\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">savedState</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">expect</span> <span class=\"n\">error</span>\n  <span class=\"kd\">def</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">Nat</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"I am not a Nat\"</span>\n<span class=\"n\">message</span>\n  <span class=\"s2\">\"nope\"</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">end</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I would expect this to throw an error like <code>Expected error \"nope\" but got \"type mismatch...\"</code>.

So I'd rather like to see \"raw\" string literals (which Python also has) that also disable other escape characters.
