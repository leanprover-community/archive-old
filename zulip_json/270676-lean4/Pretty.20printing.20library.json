The API is really nice to work with, and the design eliminates a lot of the compromising and guesswork that common when deciding on a layout with a standard pretty-printer.</p>\n<p>If nothing else, take this as another very positive though anecdotal performance report. For the most part I guessed at what data structures to use since Lean 4 is so new, but this (when compiled) performs shockingly well compared to a similar rust implementation and the reference Haskell version.</p>",
