Outside of some very few exceptions (such as a <code>Monad</code> instances), if a class could have an instance, it should have the given instance, making adding an instance for an object only a positive, and not something you would want to restrict.

They should only effect syntax if their related <code>def</code> is in scope. Things like <code>class</code> should be global by default. They are permeant properties of their related <code>def</code>s and thus should not generally be able to be turned on and off by changes in scope (in fact, I am not sure if they should ever be). The <code>instance</code> attribute should similarly be global by default, as that is <em>generally</em> the desire (but unlike things like <code>class</code>, it definitely does have cases where being local/scoped is useful).</p>",
