Second, I personally don't understand what <code>(C ...)</code> means and therefore how to fix my code. Third, the problem is really that <code>bar</code> is undefined, not because there's something wrong with its type. What I would've liked to read is something about <code>bar</code> being an unknown identifier.</p>\n<p>Even in the case of the invalid <code>def foo : Type 1 where</code>, why can't I get the same error message as the following:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">def</span> <span class=\"n\">foo</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ℕ</span> <span class=\"n\">where</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">-- invalid {...} notation, structure type expected</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">--  ℕ</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>(<code>{...}</code> still should maybe instead say <code>where</code> or <code>structure constructor</code>)</p>",
