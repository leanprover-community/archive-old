Sticking them in separate files made both take the same (long) amount of time (~25 sec),and permuting the inductions changes which one is the \"fast\" one. Subjectively I did have a much better experience editing the latter, but I think that's probably because I updated my Lean nightly between writing the first one and writing the second one (the first one was actually written quite a while ago, a few weeks).</p>",
