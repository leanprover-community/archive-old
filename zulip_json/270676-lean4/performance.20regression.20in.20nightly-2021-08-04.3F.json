There is still some overhead though with <code>pp.analyze true</code>, since the analyzer still preprocesses your big terms even though its annotations are ignored by your custom delaborator. There is probably more relatively low hanging fruit to optimize the analyzer further, but note that your example is the epitome of one where you don't want <code>pp.analyze</code> to run. It is not clear yet whether it is appropriate for <code>pp.analyze</code> to be the default, but I think your example is \"advanced\" enough already such that needing to explicitly disable it for best performance would be reasonable.</p>",
