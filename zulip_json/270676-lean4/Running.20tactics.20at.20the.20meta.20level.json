It appears that the <code>liftMetaTactic</code> does something of this sort, but I have not been able to find a concrete example demonstrating how to integrate pre-existing tactics in the Lean4 source code. I would be grateful if someone could help me understand how to modify the above code to run such tactics at the meta-level.</p>",
