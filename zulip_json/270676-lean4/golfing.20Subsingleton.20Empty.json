I'm pretty sure I could do it in Lean 3 without too much trouble so I thought I'd try in Lean 4 as it sounds like a nice beginner exercise. When proving that subsingleton types were finite I ran into the issue that <code>Subsingleton Empty</code> is not yet an instance in Lean 4 (or maybe I am missing an import). In Lean 3 one could do</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">def</span> <span class=\"n\">foo</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"bp\">∀</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">empty</span><span class=\"o\">),</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">b.</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">example</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">subsingleton</span> <span class=\"n\">empty</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">subsingleton.intro</span> <span class=\"n\">foo</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>-- this is the equation compiler being super-smart to make <code>foo</code> and then we can feed it into the constructor. But of course it would be nicer if we didn't have to make foo at all.
