        "content": "<p>Ah, the way you are using <code>escape_path</code> is a bit different than I thought. It's a bit unusual, but that doesn't make it wrong of course. Basically, you are using object-level code at the meta level as well. In particular, what <code>extractGameState</code> really does is a sort of reflection, converting an object-level expression of type <code>GameState</code> into a meta-level instance of <code>GameState</code>. That way, <code>escape_path</code> actually becomes part of the tactic, which makes some of what I have written above moot.</p>\n<p>(This actually creates an interesting ambiguity regarding what \"running the tactics that correspond to the moves\" actually means, because you now have a choice between running the tactic at the object level (as you normally would) or at the meta level (and then convert the resulting escape path back in the reverse direction of <code>extractGameState</code>). I assume you mean the former.)</p>\n<p>I haven't tried running tactics from tactics, but I think the function you are looking for is <code>evalTacticAt</code>. You'd start with <code>mvarId</code> being the result of <code>getMainGoal</code>, and then each invocation of <code>evalTacticAt</code> should give you either 0 or 1 new goals, depending on whether that move escaped the maze. (It's probably easiest to write it as a recursive function rather than a loop; not sure about the implications of either style in Lean.)</p>",
