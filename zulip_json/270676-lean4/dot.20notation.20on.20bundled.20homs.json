One thing that would be nice is to be able to support dot notation for ring homs, such as <code>p.eval_ring_hom x</code> (<code>p : R[X]</code>) or something like that, and as far as I know this is unsupported in Lean3. I did see the new dot notation that's like <code>.inl x</code>, however, which seems really cool!</p>",
