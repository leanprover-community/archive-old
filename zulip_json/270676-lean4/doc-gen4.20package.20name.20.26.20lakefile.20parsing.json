If you have an alternative idea feel free, I don't think we have really agreed upon a naming scheme for packages though? So we should probably do that.</p>\n<p>Did you actually build this with lake build or just in the server? For me when I try to build software with lake build it will actually inform me that I imported a package as <code>xy</code> but it found <code>yz</code> in the directory, at least when I last made this mistake.</p>\n<p>this also answers question 3 i guess? At least there is a check for this right now</p>",
