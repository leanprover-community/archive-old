Changing it to <code>«doc-gen4»</code> solved the issue. However, I thought about three things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The current doc-gen4 package name with french brackets and a dash isn't very straightforward (just my opinion)</li>\n<li>The error message was pretty misleading, making me think there was something wrong with the formatting when the error was just a misspelled package name</li>\n<li>Would it be nice if the package name were inferred instead of inputted manually?</li>\n</ul>",
