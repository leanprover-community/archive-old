I did not think so, but upon further thought, due to my merging of linking and compiling with <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lake/pull/89\">lake#89</a>, I  may have accidently enabled it  as I do not pass the relevant C compiler arguments (e.g., <code>-DNDEBUG</code>) to the linking command. I guess it also means that the assertion violation is coming from Lake, not Lean.</p>",
