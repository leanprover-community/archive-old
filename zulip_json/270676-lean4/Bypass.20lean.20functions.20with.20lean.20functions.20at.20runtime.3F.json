This way lean can perform fast computations on structures which appear inefficient as they are represented in lean. Nat.add's code is not efficient, but it uses the inductive structure, because it is much easier to prove things this way.</p>\n<p>Is there something similar for lean functions?<br>\nCan I bypass at runtime a lean function, with another optimized lean function with same signature? (possibly providing a proof that the two versions are equivalent)<br>\nOr is it wrong to want something like that ?</p>\n<p>Some benefits I thought of are that for some primitive functions, I can have one version with good def behavior, and another version with good runtime performance.<br>\nNext I could write more complex functions in terms of the well defined primitive functions only. I might not need to write an optimized complex function in terms of optimized primitive functions, because it might run fast enough already.<br>\nI'm saying all that as I saw some tail recursive functions in the standard library, I think tail recursivity make things faster to run, but I'm afraid it might be a distraction for proof writing...</p>",
