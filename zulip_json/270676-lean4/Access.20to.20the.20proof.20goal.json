I'm new here, so I'm sorry if this question is misplaced.<br>\nI have an idea of a project here for which having access to the current proof goal or,  more in general, to (what I think people call) the _context_ (eg. that which is shown on infoview on vscode)  in a structured manner would be useful. <br>\nThat is, I'd like to be able to extract the updated context for each line of a program for further processing. Would that, or something similar to that, be currently feasible (without  having to open vscode, that is)? If so, I'd be very grateful for some pointers :)</p>",
