Here's a silly example:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">elab</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"traceGoal\"</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">tactic</span> <span class=\"bp\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"k\">do</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"n\">g</span> <span class=\"bp\">←</span> <span class=\"n\">getMainTarget</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">dbg_trace</span> <span class=\"n\">g</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">example</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">p</span> <span class=\"n\">q</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Prop</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">h</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">p</span> <span class=\"bp\">∧</span> <span class=\"n\">q</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">p</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">q</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"kd\">by</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">traceGoal</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">have</span> <span class=\"n\">h2</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">q</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">h.right</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">traceGoal</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The two calls to <code>traceGoal</code> reveal that initially, the goal is <code>_uniq.45324 -&gt; _uniq.45325</code>, but after the use of <code>have</code> it is <code>[mdata noImplicitLambda:1 _uniq.45324 -&gt; _uniq.45325]</code>.  What happened?</p>\n<p>The reason for my interest is that I want to write tactics that decide what to do based on the form of the goal.  If the goal has the form <code>Expr.mdata m e d</code>, then I guess I need to look inside <code>e</code> to see what the form of the goal is.  It is easy enough to do that using something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">def</span> <span class=\"n\">stripMData</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">e</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">Expr</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">Expr</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">match</span> <span class=\"n\">e</span> <span class=\"k\">with</span>\n    <span class=\"bp\">|</span> <span class=\"n\">Expr.mdata</span> <span class=\"n\">_</span> <span class=\"n\">e</span> <span class=\"n\">_</span> <span class=\"bp\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">stripMData</span> <span class=\"n\">e</span>\n    <span class=\"bp\">|</span> <span class=\"n\">_</span> <span class=\"bp\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">e</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>But is that a good idea?  If I remove all of the mdata to get at the underlying expression, am I going to get myself in trouble somehow?  I'm reluctant to throw away the mdata without knowing what it is.</p>",

It's used for a number of things (e.g. better pretty-printing if I recall correctly), but it should never be semantically relevant, so you can remove it if you need to. If you construct an expression that's derived from an existing expression, it may be nice to preserve <code>mdata</code>, but my impression is that Lean itself doesn't do this consistently.</p>",
