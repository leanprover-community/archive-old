But then a simple solution to the same issue when custom tools depending on .olean files come into play is that those tools likewise should be managed by the build system. So if we e.g. add LeanInk as a local dev dependency as I suggested in the linked issue, it should never run on incompatible .oleans to begin with.</p>",
