We are certainly moving towards it becoming a product but right now it is a research project with incomplete documentation. The belief and hope is that extensive documentation will appear in the future, but right now you are looking at what research looks like, and this is very different to what eg python looks like. It's perhaps not what you're used to but this is a fact of life right now. The main resources are the code itself and research papers about lean.</p>",
