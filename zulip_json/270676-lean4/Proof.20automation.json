Lean 4's <code>simp</code> is supposed to be equivalent to your <code>auto</code>. We can do linear arithmetic with <code>linartih</code> like your <code>arith</code>, we are planning to port <code>omega</code> which is close to your <code>presburger</code> etc. For basic general proof search there is <code>library_search</code> but nothing as strong as <code>sledgehammer</code> although we do have foundations to integrate SAT solvers and Leo has told me he is very much interested in adding nice SMT support in the future so eventually we might end up with something in the direction of <code>sledgehammer</code>.</p>\n<p>So in general we do have equivalents for some of Isabelle's stuff but in general the automation in Isabelle still far exceeds ours but we are planning to put work into that in the future.</p>",

In Isabelle, <code>simp</code> is just rewriting with proven equations. While <code>auto</code> can be thought of as a combination of <code>simp</code> and <code>blast</code> (a first-order logic prover) that tackles all proof obligations. Generally, people recommend to only use <code>auto</code> to conclude a proof because of how hard it is to track what it did. If Lean's <code>simp</code> is equivalent to Isabelle's <code>auto</code>, I would take a similar careful approach. Does Lean have something equivalent to Isabelle's <code>simp</code>? i.e. something that just rewrites with proven equations?</p>",
