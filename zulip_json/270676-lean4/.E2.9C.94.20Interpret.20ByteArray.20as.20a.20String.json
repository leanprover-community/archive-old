It's hard to search by strings like that. We'd need something like <a href=\"https://hoogle.haskell.org/\">hoogle</a> or even better <a href=\"https://hoogleplus.goto.ucsd.edu/\">hoogle+</a>.  Just someone needs to implement that <span aria-label=\"sweat smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" role=\"img\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span> It's on my (very long and unrealistic) list of things I'd like to do when I have the time, but I wouldn't hold my breath on that one.</p>",
