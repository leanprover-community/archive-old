Specifically, in <a href=\"https://leanprover.github.io/functional_programming_in_lean/props-proofs-indexing.html\">the interlude about proofs</a> it asks to prove <code>5 &lt; 18</code> using <code>rfl</code>, which I don't think makes sense? For context, it's one among other propositions (that all do use <code>=</code>) in that example and the very next example asks to prove the same props using <code>by simp</code> which would make sense for <code>5 &lt; 18</code>, and is why I think this is just a small editing error. Just looking for clarification in my understanding or to report this error <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",
