So, I necessarily need vscode remote. My options are WSL2 or a linux container running on a linux server both of which I ssh into with vscode running on my desktop. So far, I've managed to set it up with Ubuntu and remoting into that. </p>\n<p>I can get nix working in it, but don't quite understand how that would interact with <code>nix-shell</code>. Given that the correct setup would only be available from within the <code>nix-shell</code> but then I don't think I can remote into that?</p>\n<p>Has anyone managed to get vscode remote working with the <code>nix</code> setup? My server is a NixOS server where I created an Ubuntu container, just because it's easiest to get vscode remote working that way. Which means for now, I only managed to get the \"basic setup\" working.</p>\n<p>Which leads me to the 2nd issue I have. Even though I've managed to get lean4 nightly builds to work, the lean4 info view seems to be empty very often when I put the cursor into any one function. When should we see the proof state?</p>",
