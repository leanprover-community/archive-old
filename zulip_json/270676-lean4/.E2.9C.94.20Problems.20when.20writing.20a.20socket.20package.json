Virtually every modern computer represents unsigned and signed integers the same way (via two's complement). In fact, most low-level IRs (like LLVM, which backs <code>clang</code>) don't make a distinction between. Thus, you should be able to use them interchangeably in virtually cases. And, at the C/C++ level you can trivially cast between the two. If you are determined to make a distinction at the Lean level, you could define an <code>Int*</code> type like <code>structure Int32 := (toUInt32 : UInt32)</code>  and it would still be unboxed.</p>",

I hate that LLVM always calls a array of n-bits an <code>integer</code>, when it in many cases it is really not one. A much more accurate descriptor would be 'word' (e.g., <code>w32</code>, <code>w64</code>) or just 'bits' (i.e., <code>b32</code>, <code>b64</code>). I would argue LLVM's naming conventions are largely just an artifact of the time when it had both signed and unsigned types, and a language which instead starts where LLVM is now should not copy that convention.</p>",

The logical coordinates are used to address  data in logical hardware components. The corresponding memory addresses and bit level representation of the containers on hardware is strictly separated and varies across hardware platforms, as well as access mode. All of this is strongly typed and implement via various C++ template tricks (including static checks on coordinate ranges etc.), see here <a href=\"https://github.com/electronicvisions/haldls\">https://github.com/electronicvisions/haldls</a>, for an overview.

However, the platform specific types/defs themselves (i.e., <code>USize</code>, <code>nativeEndianess</code>, etc.) do still need conditional definitions. Such native defs are also important for interactive / interpreted use where the platform is already determined.</p>",

Beyond that the way that LLVM describes target architectures in td files (<a href=\"https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/master/include/llvm/Target/Target.td\">https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/master/include/llvm/Target/Target.td</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/lib/Target/PowerPC/PPC.td\">https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/lib/Target/PowerPC/PPC.td</a>) would lend itself very well to a translation into a corresponding relatively sophisticated Lean dependent type, it would be possible to essentially use Lean meta programming facilities to replace the table-gen mechanism in LLVM. Of course that is mainly a ton of work and probably no-one would undertake this ;).</p>",
