I literally have no idea where the core Lean files are on my system (Ubuntu 18.04, stable installed via elan, no nix). Maybe I'll just browse the Lean 4 repo on github but it would be good if I knew how to verify if <code>∈</code> was defined -- I assume it's not, but <code>#check 5 ∈ </code> just gives me two \"expected term\" errors and I don't know what this means.</p>",
