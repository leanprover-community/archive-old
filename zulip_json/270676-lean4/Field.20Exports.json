Doing this user-side would require overwriting the <code>class</code> syntax, which would then mean you could not expand the macro to the old <code>class</code> syntax (as it has been overwritten) thus you would have to rewrite the class command elaborator from the ground up to add this little tweak. At least as far as I am aware.</p>",
