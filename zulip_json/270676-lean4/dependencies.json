However, you can just manually add them, using the same syntax as in Lean 3 (and it's pretty clear that this isn't just working by accident).</li>\n<li>Running <code>lean</code> directly (for example, <code>lean --run</code>) doesn't work by default, because there is no <code>leanpkg.path</code>. You can make it work by manually setting the <code>LEAN_PATH</code> environment variable: it should be a colon-separated list of the paths to the dependencies, each ending in <code>/build</code>.</li>\n<li><span aria-label=\"cross mark\" class=\"emoji emoji-274c\" role=\"img\" title=\"cross mark\">:cross_mark:</span> <code>leanmake bin</code> doesn't work because it doesn't link in the dependencies at the final step. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110024\">@Sebastian Ullrich</span> Is there a way to make it work? A partial workaround is to use <code>lean --run</code> instead; I'm not sure exactly which parts of the program will be interpreted vs compiled then. None of this matters for a library, of course.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that dependencies from git are now stored under <code>build/deps</code> rather than <code>_target/deps</code>, so don't be alarmed if you see no <code>_target</code> directory.</p>",

This setup could be useful for mathlib if we want/need to put some early tactics in their own package so that we can run them as compiled code. There's currently no way that an external package can refer to just this subpackage as a dependency; but that's probably fine for the time being (it would mean if you want mathlib tactics then you also need all of mathlib).</p>",
