Isn't this already in the <code>Syntax</code> info? I'm not sure what the state of the rest of the file is, whether it is still unparsed or whether this is being run in the server with a global view.</p>\n<p>I am aware we have an MVP implementation, but I would like to see at least one real code action shipping before I'm ready to start building all those other actions</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <code>Syntax</code> is already available, the \"syntax-aware editing\" I was referring to which is not available would be a function <code>Syntax → Syntax → TextEdit</code> which allows you to just modify the <code>Syntax</code> object and gives you the correct string-based edit description. If you can produce the <code>TextEdit</code> manually, all the infra is already in-place (although it has not been stress-tested as you point out).</p>",

That would allow us to keep changes localized which is important for any code action. Getting the formatting to match the surroundings is less important, even rust-analyzer isn't that great at this (it relies on rustfmt to pick up the pieces).</p>",

One tough example I've been thinking about is fusing consecutive <code>if let</code>s into <code>if ... and</code>. There's a big block of existing syntax you don't want to touch there, <em>except</em> you want to re-indent it. Would be much easier if we can just reformat the whole result for sure.</p>",
