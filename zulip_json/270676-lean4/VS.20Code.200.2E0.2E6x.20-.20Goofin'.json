        "content": "<blockquote>\n<p>That is, functions with many references perhaps?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In case anybody was wondering what actually happened:</p>\n<p>When vscode opens a hover with a source code snippet, it opens the corresponding file as a text document.  From the extension side this kind of document looks exactly like a file the user opened intentionally.  But if we told the Lean server that a file was opened, it would start a Lean worker process for that file.  It would start a Lean process every time you hover!  Clearly this must be avoided.</p>\n<p>So we've put in a hack that prevents the vscode LSP library from sending the didOpen notification.  Instead, we subscribe to the onDidChangeVisibleTextEditors event and manually send didOpen notification only for these visible text editors.</p>\n<p>There's a second complication: to support installing both the Lean 3 and Lean 4 extension at the same time, the Lean 4 extensions needs to change the language id of a file to <code>lean4</code> after it's opened.  This also used to be triggered by the visible editors event.  (Changing the language id closes and reopens the text document.  IIRC, the hover doesn't like that and opens the file again.)</p>\n<p>The recent multi-root workspace PR <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean4/pull/104\">https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean4/pull/104</a> inadvertently duplicated the setTextDocumentLanguage call and also triggered it when a document was opened.  From what I can tell, changing the language id of the hovered file makes the hover open the file again, sending it into an endless loop.  Setting the language id twice resulting in one of the calls failing, printing endless error messages on the console (thankfully, this made diagnosing the issue trivial).</p>\n<p>cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"434989\">@Chris Lovett</span></p>",
