I think that we should try to coordinate this as a regular meeting that we can all plan to attend or not as our schedule permits. I think that smaller and more regular communication will be a very good thing for keeping the lines open and moving the port along, and we can set up an agenda beforehand based on problems that have come up on zulip during the week. I am inspired in part by the Rust project team meetings, that often start with some triage of issues that have popped up on the tracker or reports on ongoing work. For the time being I don't think we need anything so formal as that, but being able to collect all the random issues folks come up with and present them in a short time span seems like a good use of time.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The problem that I would like to solve with these meetings is that Zulip is a firehose of mostly-irrelevant information for Leo, and this meeting is a good way to distill that information down to the things that are in his jurisdiction. Leo likes to be able to work for long stretches without interruption, and this arrangement makes it easy to still talk about the important things, but it requires compressing a lot of stuff into a short span and that requires some discipline. I think if we fill the meeting with half formed thoughts about porting, we won't have the time to get to everything we need to and will start hunting for additional time outside the meetings.</p>",
