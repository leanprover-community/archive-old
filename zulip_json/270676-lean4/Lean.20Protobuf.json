It includes both codegen and serialization/deserialization code. Unfortunately it uses a small amount of custom native code, so for now it's only conveniently available through Nix. </p>\n<p>(Context for more math-focused users: this is infrastructure code, making it easier for Lean programs to interact with programs written in other programming languages)</p>",
