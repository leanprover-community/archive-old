Unless you plan to ship the import with the executable, this information needs to come from the outside. Three are three ways to do this: (1) modify the <code>LEAN_PATH</code> environment variable yourself to include the path of <code>TestImport</code>'s olean, (2) have <code>lake env</code> do it for you, (3) have some CLI option on your executable that takes such a path and pass a list of such paths to <code>initSearchPath</code> as its second argument.</p>",
