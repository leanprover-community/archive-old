I've only managed to do this in lean4 for files without imports (other than the stdlib). Looking through other topics it seems that the way to do this is by manually setting <code>LEAN_PATH</code> and <code>LEAN4_DIR</code>, but it was not so clear to me how exactly I should set them. What is the best way to do this?</p>",
