This does of course have potential for false positives but this is actually a benefit here. My suggestion to solve this would be: If the <code>autoImplicit</code> feature detects a name that is longer than a single character  (since signle character is in my experience basically always something we want <code>autoImplicit</code>)  and supposed to be made auto implicitIt should start iterating over the namespaces that are in scope similar to doc-gen, if it finds something with the same name there it should mark this as a warning and tell the user about the names from unopened namespaces they might be referring to. While this does have the same potential for false benefits as what we do in doc-gen this is in my opinion a benefit because it again improves readability and maintainability:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If I have some namespace imported that contains a type with this name but just haven't opened it yet i might do that in the future, then the code that relied on the name being free will most likely break, if it was linted before and the user listened this will not happen</li>\n<li>Again if i want to read this without a full LSP session I probably don't want auto implicit names that match up with types from namespaces that are imported here already, it's just confusing to the reader because they themselves have to keep track of which namespace is open and which is not</li>\n</ol>\n<p>and in the case that you actually have a good reason to keep a name auto implicit that would be marked as a lint this way we can still have an option that marks this name as being fine for the file or w/e.</p>",
