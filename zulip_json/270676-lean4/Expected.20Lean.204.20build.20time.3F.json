They are generally on the order of 15m for <code>make -j4</code> so if we naively single-thread that by multiplying the time by 4, it would come to around an 1hr/60m build time. This is worse than my WSL2 build time and better than my MSYS2 build time (thus further indicating that WSL2 build times are, in fact, likely significantly faster than MSYS2 build times). It is also better than my MSYS2 by about ~15-20m which, while significant, is not <em>that</em> big of a difference (i.e. my times are about 30% worse). I certainly would still like to improve my times, but this at least suggests that my times are not that insanely off base.</p>",
