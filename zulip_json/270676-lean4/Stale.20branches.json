For one, it makes it rather annoying to find one's own branches when editing the repo, and it makes it very hard to discover if there actually any relevant branches in the mix. </p>\n<p>In fact, due to the absurdly large number of random dev branches, I am not even sure if there <em>are</em> any important branches in the mix.
