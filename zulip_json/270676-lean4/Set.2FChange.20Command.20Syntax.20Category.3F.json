I was suggesting this most as it seemed the simplest step in that direction since it mostly just requires <code>topLevelCommandParserFn</code> ((in particular, the category it uses) to be passed on some parameter in the context, which seems quite feasible. However, being able to overwrite <code>runFrontend</code> (and, in particular, the header processing) as well would be even cooler.</p>\n<p>I think Lean's metaprogramming framework provides a very good general base for exploring all kinds of interesting DSLs and other programming language idioms, so I will really love to be able to manipulate the entire syntax of a file (with something like <code>#lang</code>). Still though, custom commands would get pretty close to that already -- it really only misses the header.</p>",
