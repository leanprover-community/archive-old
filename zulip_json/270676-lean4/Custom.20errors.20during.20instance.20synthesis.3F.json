If Lean had it, then I could write something like:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">instance</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">Fail</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"0 is not positive\"</span><span class=\"o\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">OfNat</span> <span class=\"n\">Positive</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span> <span class=\"n\">where</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">ofNat</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">Fail.failed</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Here, <code>failed</code> is intended to make use of some evidence that <code>Fail</code> is uninhabited to discharge obligations in the instance.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, I could imagine some way to add a custom hook through the metaprogramming API.</p>\n<p>Is there some way to do what I'm thinking of here?</p>",
