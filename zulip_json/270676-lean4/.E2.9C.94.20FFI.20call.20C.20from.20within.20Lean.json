(It seems to be in the same Github organization as the library you linked to.) However, there is some problem with the linking against the c++ STL. I've opened <a href=\"#narrow/stream/270676-lean4/topic/FFI.20to.20Rust.2FC.2B.2B\">a new topic</a> for that, but thanks anyway for the help with linking C code.</p>",
