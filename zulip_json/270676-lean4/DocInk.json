Once we port the big mathlib this will most likely become a bigger concern but Sebastian already came up with the idea that we could maybe load LeanInk into the Lean compiler itself as a plugin and produce the .json files as normal build artifacts during the .olean build which would essentially eliminate the concern.</p>",

Its job should be to find all files that are not in the blacklist and end on html, then cut the html part out properly so I know all the names of modules that have to be clickable in the navbar tree, the rest is done by the Hierarchy.fromArray which definitely works correctly because it's been here for a while. It seems to me that for some reason I am not dropping the <code>.html</code> of a file name properly but I can't quite tell why.</p>",
