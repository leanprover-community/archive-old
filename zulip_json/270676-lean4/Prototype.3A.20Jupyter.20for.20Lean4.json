Note that Github renders Jupyter notebooks by default!</p>\n<h3>Rationale</h3>\n<p>As I understand it, <a href=\"https://github.com/insightmind/LeanInk\">LeanInk</a> is meant for static visualization of Lean4 code+proofs. I wondered if having a Jupyter kernel would complement this in writing \"programming\" style Lean4 code. I wonder what others feel about this, and if it makes sense to develop this further. This was a quick weekend hack to see if this is feasible (seems to be so!)</p>\n<h3>Technical details</h3>\n<p>This is implemented as a large chunk of C++ in <a href=\"https://github.com/bollu/lean-to/blob/02696aa855f35cacbf2c774cef5273d7949626c0/asm-kernel.cpp#L600\"><code>asm-kernel.cpp</code></a> that interacts with Jupyter via ZeroMQ, and a little bit of Lean4 in <a href=\"https://github.com/bollu/lean-to/blob/02696aa855f35cacbf2c774cef5273d7949626c0/REPLLib.lean\"><code>REPLLib.lean</code></a> to run Lean4 commands. Many thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/arthurpaulino/LeanREPL\"><code>arthurpaulino/LeanREPL</code></a> for the REPL code. </p>\n<h3>Questions</h3>\n<p>I'd like to develop this further for fun, so feature requests would be nice <span aria-label=\"wink\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f609\" role=\"img\" title=\"wink\">:wink:</span>. More to the point, I don't want to duplicate work and split the community's attention between the Jupyter kernel and LeanInk, so having a clearer picture of the relationship between the two would be very useful for me!</p>",
