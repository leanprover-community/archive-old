Suppose you have a hole <code>_</code> that cannot be synthesized, you can replace it with <code>(by done)</code>, where <code>done</code> is a tactic that fails when there are unsolved goals. Then, you can use tactics to simplify the context.<br>\nExample: <code>(by clear h; simp; done)</code>. Note that <code>simp</code> is not Coq <code>simpl</code> since it will use theorems marked with <code>[simp]</code> as rewriting rules, but you can use <code>simp only</code> instead. Btw, <code>simp only [foo]</code> unfolds <code>foo</code>. <code>simp only [foo] at h</code> unfolds <code>foo</code> at hypothesis <code>h</code>.</p>",
