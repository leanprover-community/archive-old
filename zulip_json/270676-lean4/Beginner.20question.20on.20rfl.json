For this I have the following struct:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">structure</span> <span class=\"n\">Event</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">α</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"n\">where</span>\n      <span class=\"n\">value</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">α</span>\n      <span class=\"n\">time</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">Nat</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I now want to name predicates on this type. It is useful to be able to show that the name of the predicate applied to an event is actually equal to the corresponding proposition. This is because I often have two different names say <code>p : Event Bool  -&gt; Prop</code> and <code>q : Event Bool -&gt; Prop</code> for the same predicate which have the exact same definition say <code>λ (e : Event Bool) =&gt; e.time ≥  5</code>, and I can then use <code>Eq.trans</code> to show that the two predicates are equal. I use this, because I have already written a theorem that says </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">theorem</span> <span class=\"n\">Prop_eq_implies</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">p</span> <span class=\"n\">q</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Prop</span><span class=\"o\">}</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">heq</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">p</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">q</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">p</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">q</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span>\n  <span class=\"bp\">λ</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">hp</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">p</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"bp\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"bp\">@</span><span class=\"n\">Eq.subst</span> <span class=\"kt\">Prop</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"bp\">λ</span> <span class=\"n\">p</span> <span class=\"bp\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">p</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"n\">p</span> <span class=\"n\">q</span> <span class=\"n\">heq</span> <span class=\"n\">hp</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>so I can then get a proof of <code>q e</code> from a proof of <code>p e</code></p>\n<p>When doing this at the top level with <code>def</code> and <code>example</code>,   this is trivial as shown below:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">def</span> <span class=\"n\">ip</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">e</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">Event</span> <span class=\"n\">Bool</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Prop</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">e.time</span> <span class=\"bp\">≥</span> <span class=\"mi\">5</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">example</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">e</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">Event</span> <span class=\"n\">Bool</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">e.time</span> <span class=\"bp\">≥</span> <span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">ip</span> <span class=\"n\">e</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">rfl</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This neatly typechecks and everything is fine. But the exact same thing fails when I put this code  in a have statement  </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"bp\">...</span>\n<span class=\"k\">have</span> <span class=\"n\">ip</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">e₁</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">Event</span> <span class=\"n\">Bool</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Prop</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">e₁.time</span> <span class=\"bp\">≥</span> <span class=\"mi\">5</span>\n<span class=\"k\">have</span> <span class=\"n\">pr_ip_eq</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">e</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">Event</span> <span class=\"n\">Bool</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">e.time</span> <span class=\"bp\">≥</span> <span class=\"mi\">5</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">ip</span> <span class=\"n\">e</span>  <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">rfl</span>\n<span class=\"bp\">...</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This somehow fails to typecheck. I am not sure why this happens. What I seem to have trouble with is that according to the book, when applying rfl, lean reduces both terms according to their definition and checks for equality. Why does it appear to not work inside a have statement?</p>\n<p>Lean version : Lean (version 4.0.0-nightly-2021-12-20, commit 068ea1beb475, Release)</p>",
