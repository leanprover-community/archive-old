Two things I have noticed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>when I run \"Lean: Restart\" (via cmd-shift-p), which was a standard part of my toolkit in Lean 3, I get <code>Command 'Lean: Restart' resulted in an error (command 'lean.restartServer' not found)</code>.  Is something not hooked up, or does this have a different name in Lean 4?</li>\n<li>when I comment out an <code>import</code> line, the keyword <code>import</code> remains blue even as the rest of the line turns green.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I can open issues for these at <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean4\">https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean4</a>, but first wanted to check whether they were actually considered issues.</p>",
