Some of those subclasses have important information, others are just noise.  It would be good if we could set a reasonable default here (i.e., that only some subclasses are enabled).  (I've run into a similar issue in Lean 3 quite often.  <code>set_option trace.simplify true</code> produces an enormous amount of information, and I usually want <code>set_option trace.simplify.failure false</code> as well.)</li>\n<li>(There could also be a toggle in the UI that allows you to enable the extra disabled-by-default subclasses.)</li>\n<li>It is also important to improve the actual traces to make use of the new features.  For example about the <code>set_option trace.Meta.synthInstance true</code>: by default I don't want to see the implementation details, I want to see which goals were generated and which instances were applied (and in as few lines as possible, with as few extra words as possible).  If an instance failed, I want to see a <span aria-label=\"cross mark\" class=\"emoji emoji-274c\" role=\"img\" title=\"cross mark\">:cross_mark:</span> right at the first line containing the instance name and not a \"failure\" message twenty lines below in a collapsed trace.</li>\n</ul>",
