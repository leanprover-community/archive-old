Afaict this issue did not exist before the most recent VSCode update. For instance, typing in <code>\\&lt;\\&lt;</code> quickly sometimes causes the cursor to jump in between the second <code>\\&lt;</code>, but students also reported that the cursor can jump to entirely different lines on different inputs. The issue with abbreviations not working also seems to occur more often according to students (I can't really reproduce this atm).<br>\nHas anyone else noticed similar issues, perhaps something that is easily reproducible?</p>",
