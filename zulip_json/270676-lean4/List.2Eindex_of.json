Let me rather present an alternative point of view:  In C++, you can advance a \"random access iterator\" (effectively a pointer-like object) by saying <code>x + n</code>.  However, this does not work with e.g. lists precisely for the reasons I indicated.  For that, you would call <code>std::advance(x, n)</code>. </p>\n<p>The point is purely that of avoiding (in this case) performance gotchas.  Making the short notations \"obviously right\".  I can say for myself that I have written plenty of dumb code when I was tired...  <code>+</code> is easy to overlook; <code>std::distance</code> has more semantic meaning.</p>\n<p>I was trying to make the same observation for traversal: <code>nth</code> seems like a good name for getting the n'th element of a traversable container. </p>\n<p>As an aside, for the cases when it might be useful - irrespective of big-O concerns - it would seem that making the syntax <code>[]</code> an alias for <code>nth</code> would still be possible. </p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",

I'm inclined to offer the short notation despite the performance pitfall, because unlike Rust, C++ and even Haskell, in Lean reasoning about code is just as important as running it, and the <code>List.nth</code> operation (however it is spelled) is very important for this.</p>",
