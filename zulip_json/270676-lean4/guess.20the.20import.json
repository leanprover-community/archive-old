I wanted to import <code>whatsnew</code> and I knew the import was Import something.something.whatsnew or something like that, maybe in Std or mathlib, but I am old and stupid and I can't remember exactly where it is or how to capitalise it, so I type <code>import whatsnew</code> and press ctrl-space and I get nothing. Is there another trick? I just have to switch to the searchbar and search all of mathlib for whatsnew and then switch back and type in whatever I found manually. Hardly the end of the world, but the Lean 3 version was cooler :-)</p>",
