I just created an issue for it <a href=\"https://github.com/dselsam/mathport/issues/25\">https://github.com/dselsam/mathport/issues/25</a> Maybe it isn't a good idea to put everything in a namespace, but it just seems like bad style to put things in <code>_root_</code>. For example, you may break if lean4 adds a definition. Also, you can't hide names when importing. Signing off now but to be continued. Thanks for your help tonight.</p>",
