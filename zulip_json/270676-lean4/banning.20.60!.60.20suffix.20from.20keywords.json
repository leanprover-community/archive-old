It was used in functions that may invoke \"panic\", macros and builtin notation . So, we decided to remove <code>!</code> suffix from all macros, but <code>panic!</code>, <code>assert!</code>, and <code>unreachable!</code> since they are just syntax sugar on top of <code>panic</code>. We are also enforcing the use of snake_case for keywords. For example, <code>natLit!</code> is now called <code>nat_lit</code>.</p>",
