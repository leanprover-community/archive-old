You can call <code>aesop?</code> to have it print the tactic proof, or <code>set_option trace.aesop.proof in aesop</code> to print the proof term, or <code>set_option trace.aesop.steps in aesop</code> to print the steps Aesop took. (The last one usually produces a lot of output.) If Aesop is slower than you'd expect given your rule set, I'd be happy to investigate.</p>",
