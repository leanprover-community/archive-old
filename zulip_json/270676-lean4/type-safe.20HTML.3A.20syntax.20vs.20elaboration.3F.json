        "content": "<p>I have been thinking about the possibilities for type-safe HTML templates in Lean4 (or markup in general). Here, by type safe, I mean more than valid and safe HTML markup (btw, I have seen existing work on this by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110024\">@Sebastian Ullrich</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"395550\">@Henrik BÃ¶ving</span>, which I am using as a starting point - thank you), but also making sure it conforms to, for instance, HTML5 to the extent possible (e.g. &lt;p&gt; only accept text nodes). </p>\n<p>In my limited view, I see two general directions:</p>\n<p>(1) keep the syntax simple/generic (parse any element/attribute/text/comment/etc) and write enhanced elaborators that can check all things HTML5. This seems to be the current current starting point: a general syntax that can capture XML markup into a general AST</p>\n<p>(2)  have a concrete syntax for each valid HTML5 element/attribute. E.g. If I wanted to create an Aria enabled template, I would also import an Html5.Aria module with syntax definitions for aria elements/attributes (e.g. aria-autocomplete or aria-checked). This concrete syntax would then produce a type-safe HTML5 AST for further elaboration, linting, etc.</p>\n<p>Do you have insights into pros and cons between (1) and (2) considering that the end goal here would be to have all the IDE features one would expect nowadays (code completion, formatting, linting, etc) coming, possibly, directly from the lean server?</p>",
