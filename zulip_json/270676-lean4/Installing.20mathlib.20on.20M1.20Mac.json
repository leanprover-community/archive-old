But if you created your project with <code>leanproject new</code> (I'm assuming you're working on a project which depends on mathlib and not on mathlib itself), then there should be a <code>leanpkg.toml</code> file at the project root which instructs the elan you already have to fetch and use a Lean 3 build.</p>",

This is an unfortunate consequence of the fact that <code>leanpkg</code> no longer exists in Lean 4, but it only affects creating new projects and fetching them, not day-to-day use. </p>\n<p>You can work around it by setting the default toolchain to Lean 3 by running <code>elan default leanprover-community/lean:stable</code> before running <code>leanproject new</code>.
