Expression templates in C++ - as clever as they are - are just a poor man's version of AST rewriting (and temporary elimination).  I also personally prefer the interfaces of some of the other C++ numerical libs (e.g. blaze or xtensor) but will concede that Eigen is popular, battle-tested and it's partially down to personal taste.</p>\n<p>That aside, I think it would make more sense to try and push all the heavy lifting/expression rewriting etc into Lean (this partially motivated my recent questions about Lean metaprogramming).  I'd also love to be able to do some other things:</p>\n<p>1) See if it's possible to leverage mathlib to help with proofs/simplifications in the expression rewriter (I've no experience with it yet but am learning quick!)<br>\n2) Write the library to be polymorphic at its core (e.g over the element type) so it could still be usable with N-D arrays over non-floats:  Fields (e.g. rationals) and other non-float types (e.g. Unums?), and even just rings/modules. I'm still getting bootstrapped with Lean and the FFI but it seems that we could then specialize/optimize the implementation for specific types (i.e. Floats) down to CPU/GPU while keeping the general versions implemented in Lean code.</p>\n<p>Since I'm still learning the language and the ecosystem, I have a very limited view of what's available.  I'm sure others much smarter than me have thought of this so any additional pointers to any prior art would be welcome!</p>\n<p>Of course, eventually the idea of a) chunked arrays b) some sort of distributed runtime will inevitably come up but I'm trying to just get my feet wet <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",

Expression templates are anyway not available as they work only at compile time. I started using Lean exactly because I wanted to do more complicated optimizations/rewritings than expression templates allow you, plus doing anything complicated with C++ templates makes you to question your life. </p>\n<p>When it comes to ND arrays, my current approach revolves around types that are isomorphic to the type <code>Index -&gt; Value</code> for example <code>a : FloatArray</code> of size <code>n*m</code> is isomorphic to a function of type <code>Fin n × Fin m -&gt; Float</code>. At its core this is enabled by the isomorphism between <code>Fin (n*m)</code> and <code>Fin n × Fin m</code>. This generalizes to arbitrarly complicated index type <code>Index</code> that you know how to flatten, i.e. have isomorphism with <code>Fin n</code>.<br>\nNothing stops you to use the same approach with <code>Array Value</code> for arbitrary type <code>Value</code> or <code>ByteArray</code> and a <code>Value</code> type that can be read/written to bytes.</p>",
