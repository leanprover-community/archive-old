        "content": "<p>Hello! After a lengthy disappearance caused by my PhD catching up with me, I've recently updated <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/lean-sys\"><code>lean-sys</code></a> to version <code>0.3.0</code> to track the latest changes to <code>lean.h</code>. The version bump from <code>0.2.0</code> is due to the breaking change of removing the <code>fixpoint</code> family of functions, as in Lean 4 commit <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/commit/f9f074dbf5a04b755d88f3f63397889c1e8d3677\"><code>f9f074d</code></a>. Hopefully I'll have times to continue my project by publishing some higher-level bindings to Lean, with the end goal of seamless integration between Lean 4 and Rust code, as I'll need for my planned thesis. If anyone has any ideas/feature requests/found bugs/etc, I'd be happy to hear!</p>",
