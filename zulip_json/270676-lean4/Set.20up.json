I'm not sure I know exactly what that means.  If I create a folder called \"Lean 4\" on my mac, navigate to that folder, and give the <code>elan override</code> command, does that mean that any Lean project I create inside that folder will use Lean 4?  Or do I create a folder for a particular project and run the command in that folder to have that project use Lean 4?  What's the best way to be able to use Lean 3 for some projects and Lean 4 for others?</p>",
