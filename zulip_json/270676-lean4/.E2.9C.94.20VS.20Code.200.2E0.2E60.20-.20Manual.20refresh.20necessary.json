The two issues are unrelated, I believe.  \"Not showing diagnostics\" is a critical issue and needs to be fixed quickly, so I didn't even look at the warning you posted.

In the file <code>Mathlib/Tactic/Basic.lean</code>, I hold CTRL and hover basically anything here:<br>\n<code>elab (name := workOnGoal) \"work_on_goal \" n:num ppSpace seq:tacticSeq : tactic</code>. Then a big block glows blue, including the docstring. A small popup prompts saying \"Checking Lean setup\" or something and disappears really quickly. And after that my CPU is taken to those peaks and stays there. It stays there even if I close all Lean files and also the Lean Infoview.</p>",
