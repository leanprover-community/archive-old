It's very useful when trying to understand how syntax from a library works. Is there anything like it in Lean? I imagine something like <code>#expand N STX</code> would do the trick, where <code>N</code> is the number of steps of expansion to perform.</p>\n<p>What I'd <em>really</em> like to do is to is to write a macro that uses this for a single steps of testing.

        "content": "<p>I think the issue with this is that macro expansion (simple syntax to syntax translations) and elaboration (syntax to Expr or other funky translations) are an interwoven process so it is not quite obvious what a \"step\" in macro expansion even means. For example you could have a term elaborator (syntax -&gt; Expr) for some specific syntax that then recursively calls into term elaboration for a bunch of its arguments which in turn happen to call macro expansion and then term elaboration etc. </p>\n<p>You could e.g. print every time that <code>elabTerm</code> is called but that won't give you the big picture either since it can be called recursively on subterms etc. </p>\n<p>I also don't know what the do elaborator is even doing here. I wouldn't be surprised if the above isn't the syntactic translation that is happening but it is instead building the application of bind directly as an Expr directly or something else.</p>",

        "content": "<p>It definitely seems plausible that this simple spec is not how <code>do</code> is implemented - sorry for the red herring.</p>\n<p>But I think that there is a fairly reasonable definition of a \"step\" of expansion, and that's with regards to hygiene. My understanding is that each step corresponds to a fresh scope that's applied to a piece of syntax, and further recursive calls inside an elaborator are something more like Racket's <code>local-expand</code> than they are like expansion steps.</p>\n<p>This seems like it would be handy for explaining and debugging fairly simple notations, even if it's not going to be useful for big complicated things.</p>",
