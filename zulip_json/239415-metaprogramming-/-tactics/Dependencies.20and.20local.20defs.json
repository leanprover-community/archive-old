One point I'm not sure about, and on which I would appreciate your feedback, is the handling of local defs. Copy-pasting the relevant comment from the PR:</p>\n<p>The interesting case is this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">N</span>\n<span class=\"n\">m</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">N</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span>\n<span class=\"n\">h</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">m</span> <span class=\"bp\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Does <code>h</code> depend on <code>n</code>? Currently, the PR says no. This simplifies the implementation since \"depends on\" can be decided by a simple syntactic occurrence check. <code>kdepends_on</code> infamously ignores local defs altogether. However, I find all this semantically fishy.</p>\n<p>Opinions?</p>",
