It then decomposes each sum into summands and rearranges them according to what the user specifies.</p>\n<p>My problem is that the tactic will fail is at least one of the summands that appear in the whole expression does not contain one of the terms specified by the user.  Is there a way to get the tactic to succeed if on at least one of the found sums it succeeds?</p>\n<p>Here is an example of what I would like to work.  Suppose that you want to prove the equality</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code>  <span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"bp\">+</span> <span class=\"mi\">3</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span> <span class=\"bp\">+</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>You think, if only I could commute the <code>1</code> and the <code>3</code>, then I would be done.  So, you call the <code>move_add</code> tactic saying <code>move_add 1</code>.  The tactic looks at the expression, finds that <code>1 + 3</code> and <code>2 + 2</code> are sums and tries to rearrange them, putting <code>1</code> to the right of each sum.  On <code>1 + 3</code> it succeeds, on the <code>2 + 2</code> it fails.</p>\n<p>I would like the tactic to perform the substitution on the branch where it succeeded and ignore the error from the other branch.  </p>\n<p>Is there a way to do this?</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
