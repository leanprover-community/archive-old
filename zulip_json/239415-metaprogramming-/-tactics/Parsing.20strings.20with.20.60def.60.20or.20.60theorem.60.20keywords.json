I expect that lean should have a built-in mechanism of converting a statement like <code>theorem foo (m n : ℤ) : m + n = n + m</code> to <code>theorem foo : ∀ (m n : ℤ), m + n = n + m</code> (where all the parameters are pushed to the right of the colon with universal quantification), because I usually see the latter when I <code>#check</code> theorem names. </p>\n<p>Is there a way for me to parse strings that contain <code>theorem</code> or <code>def</code> keywords? Alternatively, is there an in-built function that pushes all the parameters to the right of the colon, so that I can simply discard everything to the left of the colon and run the usual <code>`lean.parser.with_input interactive.types.texpr</code>?</p>",
