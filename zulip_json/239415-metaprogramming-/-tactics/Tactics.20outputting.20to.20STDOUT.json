Right now, I'm trying to get tactics that output things to display their output to the users. By tweaking a few things, I managed to get <code>library_search</code> to output to STDOUT, but I'm getting stuck trying to get <code>squeeze_simp</code> to output to STDOUT. I've replaced all calls to <code>trace</code> with <code>unsafe_perform_io $ io.print</code> but so far when I use <code>lean --make</code> it doesn't output to STDOUT. Is there a better way to get Lean tactics to output to STDOUT?</p>",
