The idea is for it to prove statements like <code>degree (C 2 * X ^ 3 - X + 2) = 3</code> and <code>degree (X ^ 5) = 5</code>.<br>\nAfter skimming <a href=\"https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2018/06/13/ab3/\">Kevin's post</a> and <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/extras/tactic_writing.html\">Mario's Tutorial</a>, I think I have an idea of what the pseudocode should be, but I have no experience so I'm not sure if I'm falling into a trap: </p>\n<p>Let f be the constant polynomial expression (which should have degree n)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reflect the f to a list-based representation (sort of like in Kevin's post)</li>\n<li>\n<p>Express the reflected f as a sum of the highest nonzero term and the rest<br>\n     --&gt; the highest nonzero degree term has degree n by <code>degree_monomial</code><br>\n     --&gt; the rest has degree less than n by recursing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use <code>degree_add_eq_of_degree_lt</code> to finish the proof</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Does this seem like a sane way to do this?
