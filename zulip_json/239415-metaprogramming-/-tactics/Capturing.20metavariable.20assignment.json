Specifically, I want to apply a tactic to a goal, do something with the produced subgoals, then later on backtrack to the state before the tactic was run. This backtracking should reset not only the goals but also any metavariables that were assigned by the tactic. Can I achieve this by just saving the <code>tactic_state</code>?</p>",
