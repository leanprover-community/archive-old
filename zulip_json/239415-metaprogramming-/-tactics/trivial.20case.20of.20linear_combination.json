But, which <code>0</code> is that? The tactic builds the sum of hypotheses without looking at the target type. You can leave this type as a metavariable to be inferred later, which works. But you also need an <code>add_group</code> instance on it, so at some point after it's inferred you need to call type class inference</p>",
