Those become side goals.<br>\nNow consider \"rw foo _ b\". My understanding is that the new side goal a will be automatically discharged only if b somehow implies a as it is.<br>\nIf a is instead implicit, we have rw foo b, and this lack of mentioning of a means that it relies on on-site unification, which is simplest to do as leaving a side goal, since the statement might not be valid without having an \"a\".<br>\nWhy does switching from implicit to explicit then help with these side goals? I think because implicit arguments are elaborated eagerly while explicit and also {{}} are not. So in that deferred elaboration case, the side goal is formed only after choice of rewrite subexpression, and can thus be discharged.</p>\n<p>A theory, I might have a mistaken understanding of the tactic and the interplay of elab and unif.</p>",
