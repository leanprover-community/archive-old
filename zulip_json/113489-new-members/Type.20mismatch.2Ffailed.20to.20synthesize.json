The issue, I think, is that you can't raise a power in the submodule. What I think I want is to coerce i.2 into a polynomial in the bigger ring and I think that addresses both issues. If yes, how would I go about that? If no, what should I be looking at?</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">data.mv_polynomial.basic</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">ring_theory.polynomial.homogeneous</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">open_locale</span> <span class=\"n\">big_operators</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">def</span> <span class=\"n\">is_waring_decomposition</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">σ</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"o\">}</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">R</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"o\">}</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">comm_semiring</span> <span class=\"n\">R</span><span class=\"o\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">p</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">mv_polynomial</span> <span class=\"n\">σ</span> <span class=\"n\">R</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">s</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">finset</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">ℕ</span> <span class=\"bp\">×</span> <span class=\"n\">mv_polynomial.homogeneous_submodule</span> <span class=\"n\">σ</span> <span class=\"n\">R</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"o\">))</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"bp\">∑</span> <span class=\"n\">i</span> <span class=\"k\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">s</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">i.2</span><span class=\"bp\">^</span><span class=\"n\">i.1</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">p</span>\n</code></pre></div>",
