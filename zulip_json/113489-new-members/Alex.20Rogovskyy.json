I have previous experience with Coq, but just got into Lean recently. Currently, I'm thinking about implementing the Jordan Normal Form theorem (as it's apparently not done yet). Not quite sure yet in what generality I should do it or how difficult it's going to be; probably going to start with a quite specific version. Looking forward to hopefully making a useful contribution to mathlib.</p>",
