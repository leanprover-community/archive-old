I've been slowly learning \"Theorem Proving in Lean 4\" with my friends <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"454439\">@shimsw20</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"475339\">@Minju Kim</span> since the beginning of this year.</p>\n<p>I hope to start an EdTech company one day that creates video games and other media for learning STEM subjects. I'm sure proof assistants like Lean and <a href=\"https://github.com/digama0/mm0\">Metamath Zero</a> will play crucial roles in developing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_game\">serious games</a> for mathematics education.</p>\n<p>But I still have a lot to learn. After I finish \"Theorem Proving in Lean 4,\" I'd like to read \"Functional Programming in Lean\" and \"Metaprogramming in Lean 4.\" Perhaps I could start a small project such as <a href=\"https://github.com/marcusrossel/lean-snakebird\">lean-snakebird</a> by then.</p>\n<p>I think the future for Lean and formal mathematics is bright!</p>",
