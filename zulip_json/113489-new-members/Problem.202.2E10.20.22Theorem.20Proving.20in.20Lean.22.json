I was looking at the <a href=\"https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/dependent_type_theory.html#exercises\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/dependent_type_theory.html#exercises\">Theorem Proving in Lean book exercises in Chap 2</a> which asks to both add two vectors together and reverse a vector. I have the following questions: </p>\n<p>1. Why does it want to make a constant instead of a definition?<br>\n 2. Normally, I would pattern match in Haskell on the head and tail of a list to solve both problems, but I don't know how to do this without recursion (as recursion isn't mentioned until later in chap 8). Any hints as to how to do this without recursion would be appreciated.</p>",
