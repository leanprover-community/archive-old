I often need to expand a function (replace the name by its definition in the goal and/or local context) in order to make a certain lemma work. However, the command <code>unfold</code> does not succeed, and I use the tactic <code>change</code> instead. This makes my code harder to write. I assume there is no situation where the command <code>change</code> is really needed. Is there a general advice about something that <code>change</code> can be always replaced by?</p>",
