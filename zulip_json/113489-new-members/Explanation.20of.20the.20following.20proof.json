I've managed to pull together enough examples and pushed around enough variables to eventually get to a proof that the computer accepted. Why are we allowed to assume and <code>x : U</code> and then assume <code>A x</code>? Are we always allowed to assume <code>x</code> and <code>A x</code> for \"free\" in predicate logic proofs?</p>\n<p>Also, why does showing false prove this theorem? This is another piece that is very confusing to me.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Your confusion seems to be not about this entire statement but rather about the <code>∀ x, ¬ A x</code> part. What this means is that for an arbitrary x the predicate A does not hold, so in order to proof this we assume that x is some arbitrary value and then have to show that ¬ A x holds for this specific x. As Eric pointed out the definition of negation in Lean is that assuming the statement leads to false so if we want to prove the negation we do exactly that, assume it and base on this information prove false.</p>",
