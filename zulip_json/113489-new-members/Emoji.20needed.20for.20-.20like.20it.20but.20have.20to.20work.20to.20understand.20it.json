In this sense, emojis are used to disambiguate what we're feeling when we are writing online messages. In contrast, if I always use the same emoji, people might misunderstand my true intent. For instance, my current emotional state can be expressed with a \"<span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span>\", but If I always use it, it can be misunderstood with sarcasm, which is something that I've been trying to abolish from my communication for the last 5~6 years.</p>\n<p>I like you and your spontaneity, so you can take this as an opportunity to adapt.
