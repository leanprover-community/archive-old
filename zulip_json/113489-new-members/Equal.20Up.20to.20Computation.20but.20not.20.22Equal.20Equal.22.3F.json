Essentially, I have a dependent type, let's say a Vector, which depends on a Coordinate Frame. I can create two Coordinate Frames which are unintentionally equal up to computation, but not \"equal equal\". Then, I can create two Vectors using the frames which are equal up to computation, but not \"equal equal\". Next, an operation on Vectors, say, adding two Vectors together, which requires their Coordinate Frame to be the same will fail because of  the dependent type. </p>\n<p>I am wondering if there's any way in Lean to work around this. If the dependent type values are equal up to computation, I want the type check to succeed. </p>\n<p>I attached code, my full solution might be a bit too long but hopefully it is clear. If the code or what I'm describing is not clear, please let me know. Greatly appreciate any ideas here.</p>",

Hi Reid, thank you, Yes, I think that's exactly right, the type class instance relies on the dependent type value, which is why it can't find the instance, and when they are \"equivalent\" with reductions, whatever the term is, I need it to use the same instance.

Just as some context, this work is part of a US NSF research project at the University of Virginia in which we're, among other things, formalizing aspects of mathematical physics to establish a semantic domain for cyber-physical systems software. We had originally (last summer) written our own affine_space library on which what Andrew is doing was based. Then along came an affine_space contribution to mathlib, so we just ported what we'd built to that underlying library.  We'd be happy to see what we're trying to produce here -- an affine coordinate space library -- be of use to the broader community as well.  I've made our repo public: <a href=\"https://github.com/kevinsullivan/affine_lib\">https://github.com/kevinsullivan/affine_lib</a>. If it seems appropriate and useful at some point, we'd be glad to contribute a future version of this work to the Lean community.</p>",
