        "content": "<p>I just opened <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/16601\">#16601</a> which allows you to replace positivity by monotonicity. But to make use of that, we need the partial order on the function space. We actually have <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/bounded_continuous_function.partial_order\">docs#bounded_continuous_function.partial_order</a>, so in your current setting you can directly do the replacement. However I think using continuous function is morally wrong: if you only want to deal with discrete groups you should use <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/lp\">docs#lp</a> and for the general case you should use <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/measure_theory.Lp\">docs#measure_theory.Lp</a> with <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/measure_theory.measure.haar_measure\">docs#measure_theory.measure.haar_measure</a> (with p = ⊤, i.e. infinity); in either case, continuous functions don't show up. However, these spaces apparently don't have partial order instances on them; for <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/lp\">docs#lp</a> it would be easy and for <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/measure_theory.Lp\">docs#measure_theory.Lp</a> we could just transfer the instance <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/measure_theory.ae_eq_fun.partial_order\">docs#measure_theory.ae_eq_fun.partial_order</a>.
