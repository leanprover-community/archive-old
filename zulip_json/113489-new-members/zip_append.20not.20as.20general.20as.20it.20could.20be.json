It seems to me that the way this theorem is posed is a little less general than it could be - in particular, it supposes that the four lists involved have the same type, where only each pair being appended needs to have the same type. I was able to alter it very easily to use <code>{l₁ r₁ : list α} {l₂ r₂ : list β}</code>, which did solve my problem. This is compatible with the general version of <code>list α → list β → list (α × β)</code></p>\n<p>I'm willing to make PR to fix this, but of course thought I'd ask here first as the contributions page recommends. I'm very familiar with [functional] programming &amp; mathematics, but new to formalizing mathematics and Lean, so it's also possible I'm just missing a simple way to leverage this theorem in my situation, so any feedback is appreciated!</p>",
