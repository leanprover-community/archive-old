I have absolutely nothing against using the axiom of choice, but this is for simplicity, and also, in ZF you wouldn't need it here: you would say that the set of (x,y) with P(x,y) forms the graph of a function, so well, you have a function.</p>\n<p>Here is a concrete example, with the existence of a minimum for nonempty sets of integers. This will be an opportunity for me to ask other questions, and you can also help me with any oddities in the code (it does work, at least!) By the way, I have made no attempt at checking whether this was already in mathlib, this is for fun.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">data.nat.basic</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">tactic</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">-- Definition of the minimum of a set of integers.</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">def</span> <span class=\"n\">is_minimum</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">A</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">set</span> <span class=\"n\">ℕ</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ℕ</span> <span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"bp\">∈</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span> <span class=\"bp\">∧</span> <span class=\"bp\">∀</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"bp\">∈</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"bp\">≤</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"c\">/-</span><span class=\"cm\"> We want to show that any nonempty set of integers has a minimum.</span>\n<span class=\"cm\">First we prove the following artificial version, allowing us to use</span>\n<span class=\"cm\">induction. -/</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">lemma</span> <span class=\"n\">min_exists'</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">A</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">set</span> <span class=\"n\">ℕ</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"n\">ℕ</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">h</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"bp\">∃</span> <span class=\"n\">k</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"n\">ℕ</span> <span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">k</span> <span class=\"bp\">∈</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span> <span class=\"bp\">∧</span> <span class=\"n\">k</span> <span class=\"bp\">≤</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"bp\">∃</span> <span class=\"n\">m</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ℕ</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">is_minimum</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span> <span class=\"n\">m</span>\n<span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"kd\">begin</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">---- By induction on n.</span>\n<span class=\"n\">induction</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"k\">with</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"n\">IH</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">---- Case n=0.

Mathematics in lean gets divides up into two \"universes\" -- the stuff in <code>Prop</code> (theorem statements and proofs) and the stuff in <code>Type</code> (definitions like the real numbers or <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\pi</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">π</span></span></span></span> or the definition of a group structure) and the axiom of choice is basically the way to get from the <code>Prop</code> universe to the <code>Type</code> universe. For example to show the product of nonempty types is nonempty you start with a proof that each of the factors are nonempty, apply Lean's AC to get a term in each factor, and then take the product of these terms.</p>",
