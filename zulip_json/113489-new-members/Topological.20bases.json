You had trouble using <code>is_topological_basis</code> because this predicate, like most of the library, is really meant to work with a single topology on a given type. In technical terms, the topological structure is inferred by a mechanism called \"type class instance resolution\" that works great but assumes there is only one instance of each class on a given type (this is a simplified story, but good enough for now). This instance resolution is part of <em>elaboration</em>, the process where the proof assistant tries to figure out all the information you didn't explicitly provided. The good news here is that you can always override this elaboration process by prefixing lemma or definition names with a <code>@</code> and providing as much information as you want (using underscores for stuff you don't want to provide).</p>",
