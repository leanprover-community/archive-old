I followed the instructions up to \"Run <code>cp \"$(which python)\" \"$(which python)\"3</code>\", at which point I got the error <code>bash: $'\\302\\226cp': command not found</code>. I then tried just running python through git bash, i.e.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">elbai</span><span class=\"bp\">@</span><span class=\"n\">DESKTOP</span><span class=\"bp\">-</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"n\">E616F8</span> <span class=\"n\">MINGW64</span> <span class=\"bp\">~</span>\n<span class=\"err\">$</span> <span class=\"n\">python</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>and it just hangs. It seems that this is a known issue: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32597209/python-not-working-in-the-command-line-of-git-bash\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32597209/python-not-working-in-the-command-line-of-git-bash</a>.  The fix suggested in the thread of using <code>winpty python</code> doesn't quite work for me either, as it appears to do nothing, but then all text that I enter in the terminal window becomes invisible. This is also a known issue <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/45693\">https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/45693</a>. </p>\n<p>Anyway I tried a load of things and have somehow managed to get myself a python3 alias, although I still cannot run python from git bash, but I will try to work around it. I may use a different shell. Since I don't really know what worked I probably won't be very helpful in trying to work out a solution, but I thought I would make people aware of the issue anyway.</p>",
