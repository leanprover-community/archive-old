        "content": "<p>What's going on here is that when Lean sees <code> G →* H</code> it asks the type class inference system (the square bracket system) to check that G and H are groups, but the type class inference system is initialised only with the square bracket stuff that comes before the colon, so it sees <code>[group G]</code> but not <code>[group H]</code>. The <code>by exactI</code> trick re-initialises the system (it switches to tactic mode and then straight back to term mode).</p>",

In particular, if the argument manages to construct a finitely generated group from a countable group, then I would create a <code>def</code> for the type housing that finitely generated group, and then put the relevant instances (group and finitely generated) on it. Then construct the group homomorphism from the countable group into this group you constructed.</p>",
