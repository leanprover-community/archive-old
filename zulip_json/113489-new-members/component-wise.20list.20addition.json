If you define its inverse <code>to_fn</code>, you can use the fact that component-wise addition is already defined on <code>(fin 3) → ℝ</code> to get:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">instance</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">has_add</span> <span class=\"n\">R3</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span> <span class=\"n\">add</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"bp\">λ</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">v</span> <span class=\"n\">w</span><span class=\"o\">),</span> <span class=\"n\">vector</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">of_fn</span> <span class=\"o\">((</span><span class=\"n\">to_fn</span> <span class=\"n\">v</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"bp\">+</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">to_fn</span> <span class=\"n\">w</span><span class=\"o\">))</span> <span class=\"o\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Then the proof that this is in fact component-wise addition is really short!</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">lemma</span> <span class=\"n\">component_wise</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span> <span class=\"n\">z</span> <span class=\"n\">x&#39;</span> <span class=\"n\">y&#39;</span> <span class=\"n\">z&#39;</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ℝ</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"bp\">::</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span> <span class=\"bp\">::</span> <span class=\"n\">z</span> <span class=\"bp\">::</span> <span class=\"n\">vector</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">nil</span> <span class=\"bp\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">x&#39;</span> <span class=\"bp\">::</span> <span class=\"n\">y&#39;</span> <span class=\"bp\">::</span> <span class=\"n\">z&#39;</span> <span class=\"bp\">::</span> <span class=\"n\">vector</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">nil</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span>\n    <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"bp\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">x&#39;</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"bp\">::</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">y</span> <span class=\"bp\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">y&#39;</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"bp\">::</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">z</span> <span class=\"bp\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">z&#39;</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"bp\">::</span> <span class=\"n\">vector</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">nil</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">rfl</span>\n</code></pre></div>",
