I guess my confusion is due to the fact that in my naive mental model, with an <code>f</code> of signature <code>def f {x : α} (y : α) : α</code>, <code>f y</code> works like an abbreviation for <code>@f _ y</code>. But as you point out, this is an oversimplification that doesn't always work, and this probably becomes apparent in my example.</p>",
