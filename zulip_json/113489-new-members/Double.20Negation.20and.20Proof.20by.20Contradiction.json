I'm looking for some help with proofs that prove the negation of a proposition (-A) by contradiction. </p>\n<p>My problem arises as the type checker expects the negation of the already negated proposition (--A) to lead to false, rather than just the proposition (A) itself. If I use the have keyword to prove A from --A, my text then type checks to ... -&gt;  A -&gt;  -A and fails given this extra step (pseudo example at the bottom).</p>\n<p>Is there a way around this double negation problem? I've tried rewriting the proofs but can't seem to do quite a few of the exercises without something of this form. Any all help would be greatly appreciated it. Moreover, apologize for the noob question, this has been quite the humbling evening/afternoon</p>\n<p>-Example-<br>\n(assume hNNA : \\not \\not A,<br>\nhave hA : A, from ...<br>\nshow false, h? hA)<br>\n-Error-<br>\ntype mismatch at application<br>\nA→ false<br>\nbut is expected to have type<br>\n  ¬¬A → false</p>",
