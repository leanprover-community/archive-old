Clicking on a basic concept like convergence on the undergraduate maths page brings me to a very general formulation of convergence in terms of filters, and I'm guessing that many basic facts about convergence are only formalised at this level of abstraction, which of course makes perfect sense.</p>\n<p>However, suppose that I'm formalising something which deals with a specific kind of convergence e.g. sequences of real numbers. I want to express this using the straightforward epsilon/delta formulation, but at the same time I want to potentially appeal to basic theorems about convergence which are already proven in mathlib. Is the intended approach that I write out the simple definition and then demonstrate somehow that it is an instance of the abstract concept?</p>",
