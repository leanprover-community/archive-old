Then you possibly have a variant of the result when the whole space is two-dimensional, for convenience of people using it in that context. (E.g. when stating an IMO geometry problem it makes sense to have <code>[finite_dimensional ℝ V] (hd2 : findim ℝ V = 2)</code> rather than embedding the plane in a possibly larger space.) (When working with a triangle, you don't need those extra hypotheses, but you would if e.g. dealing with four points that must be coplanar.)</p>\n<p>I think area in Heron (in mathlib proper) ought to be using the measure theory part of the library. To give and justify a definition of area/volume for an arbitrary Euclidean (affine) space by reference to one for <code>euclidean_space ℝ (fin n)</code> (I'm not sure how close what we have on product measures is to giving us the latter), you need (a) an isometry from the arbitrary space to the <code>euclidean_space</code> (which we have, more or less, given an isometry between <code>P</code> and <code>V</code> from <code>vadd_const</code> etc. together with <code>linear_isometry_equiv.of_inner_product_space</code>) and (b) a proof that the measure on the <code>euclidean_space</code> is invariant under isometries, which I don't think we have, to show the definition is genuinely independent of the arbitrary choice of isometry used. (More generally, we ought to have that any affine map multiplies the measure by the absolute value of the determinant.)</p>\n<p>Then you have the matter of expressing results on area / volume in a way that makes sense for a two-dimensional triangle in a larger-dimensional space, so want a notion of two-dimensional measure meaningful in that context (and to show it's equal to measure in a two-dimensional space when you use coercions to treat the subspace as a Euclidean space itself; I'm not sure we have all those coercions yet). (As an example of why that generality is useful, clearly we ought to have the result that the volume of a (possibly degenerate) n-dimensional simplex is equal to 1/n * volume of base * height, which is talking about both (n-1)-dimensional and n-dimensional volumes in the same space.)</p>\n<p>I think convex hull makes sense as the thing you are taking the measure of (see Yury's past unfinished attempts to redo convexity in mathlib for affine spaces, <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/2910\">#2910</a>).</p>\n<p>In the absence of being a statement about areas in a form properly linked to the measure theory part of the library, maybe the archive is a better place for the proof (with a view to being moved into mathlib proper once linked with measure theory).</p>",
