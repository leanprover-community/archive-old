        "content": "<p>I've run into the issue </p>\n<p>\"invalid 'structure' header, field 'class W' from 'class Y' has already been declared.\" </p>\n<p>This is because I want a class Z that extends from both class Y and class X. The issue is, class X and class Y are both extensions of class W. I would like to keep classes X and Y as they are, but I don't know how to handle construction of class Z if I'm not allowed to inherit from class W twice. In other words, the following diagram cannot be constructed:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">class</span> <span class=\"n\">W</span> <span class=\"c1\">-----&gt; class X</span>\n  <span class=\"bp\">|</span>                 <span class=\"bp\">|</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">v</span>                 <span class=\"n\">v</span>\n<span class=\"n\">class</span> <span class=\"n\">Y</span>   <span class=\"c1\">-----&gt; class Z</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>where arrows are extending to a class. Is there a nice way to clean this up? I would rather not have to list out all the hypotheses from either X or Y in the construction of Z, if that is avoidable. Obviously I could do that, but I would much rather keep the structure of Z inheriting from both X and Y, if possible.</p>",
