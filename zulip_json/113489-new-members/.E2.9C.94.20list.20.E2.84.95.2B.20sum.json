I'm in a situation, where is is much more convenient to have  <code>a : list ℕ+</code> instead of <code>a : list ℕ</code>. However, by the way list.sum is defined, I cannot sum it over <code>ℕ+</code>, as it is required to have a zero. Here is an mwe :</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">tactic</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">lemma</span> <span class=\"n\">test</span>\n  <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">list</span> <span class=\"n\">ℕ</span><span class=\"bp\">+</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">h</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"o\">])</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">a.sum</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">5</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"gr\">sorry</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>What would be the best solution to the situation at hand, if I persist that <code>a : list ℕ+</code>? I've thought about lifting <code>a</code> to <code>list ℝ</code> but with no success for now.</p>",
