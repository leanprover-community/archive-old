        "content": "<p>The way VS code works is a single window is tied to a single language server.  When you use File/New Window you are creating an entirely new instance of VS code which will create it's own entirely new language server (for example these could be browsing different folders with different versions of lean, or better yet, one vs code is browsing a local folder while the other is connected via SSH to a remote folder on another machine!).  So, the InfoView then is tied to one VS code window only and cannot be drag/dropped out to a different monitor.  This is kind of a limitation of how VS code works (unfortunately).  So, folks like me end up with a huge curved monitor so that a full screen VS code feels like 2 monitors :-)</p>",
