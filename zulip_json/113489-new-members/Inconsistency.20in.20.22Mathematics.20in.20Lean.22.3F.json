In Section 2.2 \"Proving Identities in Algebraic Structures\" one is asked to \"reprove\" theorems from the library. One of the first is neg_add_cancel_right, which is a + b + -b=a. However, if I do #check neg_add_cancel_right later on to check what is in the library it tells me that this is a + -b + b = a.</p>",
