Here's what I mean:<br>\nLet's say I have <code>constant apple : a → b → c</code>,<br>\nnow, when I do <code>#check apple</code>, Lean will print <code>apple : a → b → c</code>, but I want it to print the redundant parentheses like so: <code>apple : a → (b → c)</code>.</p>\n<p>Is this even possible? Skipping redundant parentheses seems like some additional work than just always printing them so to me it seems reasonable that such an option should exist.</p>\n<p>Thanks for the answers!</p>\n<p>(Context: The system I described in <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"113489\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/error.20when.20using.20theorem.2Flemma.20instead.20of.20def\">#new members &gt; error when using theorem/lemma instead of def</a> requires redundant parentheses for well-formed-formulas, but inserting them manually is labour-intensive and error-prone.)</p>",
