Note here that <code>N</code> is a real number. I then perform case analysis on <code>N &lt; 0</code> and expected <code>n</code> to reduce to <code>0</code> in the case where the inequality holds and <code>int.nat_abs (some (exists_floor N) + 1)</code> in the other case. However, in both cases, I still have <code>n : ℕ := ite (N &lt; 0) 0 (int.nat_abs (some _ + 1))</code>. How do I trigger reduction for <code>n</code>?</p>",
