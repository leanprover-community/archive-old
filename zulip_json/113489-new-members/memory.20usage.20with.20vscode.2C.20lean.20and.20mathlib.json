The general tips are: definitely don't ever edit a mathlib or core Lean file unless for some reason you really have to, close files you're not using, and if this doesn't fix the problem (which it might not) then maybe you have uncovered an issue with something not being irreducible, so post a <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mwe.html\">#mwe</a> and people can look at it and try and figure out what the problem is. People would typically happily look at sluggish files if they just import mathlib stuff. Issues you find might help to make mathlib compile faster, which is always something we like.
