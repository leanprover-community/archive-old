My name is Tor, and I just finished the tutorial and would like to try to contribute something. <br>\nI'm a third semester master studying at the University of Bonn.<br>\nI've been browsing the math-lib docs trying to find something I might contribute. I noticed that geometry seems quite sparse so I was thinking of implementing some basic Riemannian geometry.</p>",
