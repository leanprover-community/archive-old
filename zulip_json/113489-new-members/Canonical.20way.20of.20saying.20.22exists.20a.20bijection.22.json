My first thought was to use <code>equiv</code> like <code>X ≃ Y</code>, but this lives in Type wheras I just want a <code>Prop</code>. There are a few possible ways of saying what I want, e.g. <code>∃ f, bijective f</code> or <code>nonempty (X ≃ Y)</code> but it seems like there should be a notation or name for it which we'd already know to be symmetric, transitive etc.</p>",
