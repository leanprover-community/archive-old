I got to the end and when I try to test it in VSCode, I get:</p>\n<p>Unable to start the Lean server process: Error: spawn lean ENOENT --- The lean.executablePath \"lean\" may be incorrect, make sure it is a valid Lean executable</p>\n<p>In my git bash terminal, if I type \"which lean\" I get: /c/Users/keefe/.elan/bin/lean, so I think lean is installed and all, but VSCode is having trouble finding it I guess. Any help is much appreciated.</p>",
