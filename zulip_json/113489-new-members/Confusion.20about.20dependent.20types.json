However, lists and product are there also in Isabelle and indeed in Isabelle, through type constructors, you can have types depending on other types. After a discussion on the Isabelle's Zulip, my guess is that what distinguishes dependent type theory from simple type theory is that in dependent type theory types can depend on terms. Things such as Pi types and Sigma types, that are not present in Isabele, ask for an term of type <code>α → Type*</code> which is a term that is not a type. Is this correct? If yes I wonder why this remark is not there in the book, since it seems quite central! Also, in case yes, is still correct to say that list and product are dependent types? If yes one could argue that simple type theory also has dependent types...</p>",
