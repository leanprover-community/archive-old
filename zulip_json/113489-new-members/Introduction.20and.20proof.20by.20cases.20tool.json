My senior project was also ?inventing/ discovering? a new modal logic where my supervisor was Roy T. Cook. I was interested in adding proof tools to Mathlib for complicated proofs that use proof by cases, in the least controversial modal logic K, using Kripke Semantics. It seems to me that this could help greatly reduce complexity in certain proofs by cases. Is this something that already exists in Mathlib, that I didn't find, or would it be useful?</p>",
