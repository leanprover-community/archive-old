I am trying to prove something related to gaussian measure in Lean and thus I need a lot of theorems to evaluate the integration parts.  Someone has told me <code>gaussian_integral</code>, which is quite useful. But I still need some other theorems. My first question is that suppose that I have <code>∫ (x : ℝ), x * exp (-x ^ 2)</code>, is there any way that I can evaluate this in lean?</p>",
