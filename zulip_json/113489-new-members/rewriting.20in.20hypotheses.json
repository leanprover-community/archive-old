It will apply <code>nat.no_confusion</code> in your example (which is almost the same as <code>encode</code> in HoTT. This means that if <code>h</code> is an equality between two different constructors, then it will close the goal, and if <code>h</code> is an equality between the same constructor, it will derive the equalities between the arguments of this constructor, and apply cases to those equalities.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"kn\">open</span> <span class=\"n\">nat</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">example</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"bp\">ℕ</span><span class=\"o\">}</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">h</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">succ</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">false</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"k\">by</span> <span class=\"n\">cases</span> <span class=\"n\">h</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">example</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"n\">m</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"bp\">ℕ</span><span class=\"o\">}</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">h</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">succ</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">succ</span> <span class=\"n\">m</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">m</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"k\">by</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span> <span class=\"n\">cases</span> <span class=\"n\">h</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">refl</span> <span class=\"o\">}</span>\n</pre></div>",
