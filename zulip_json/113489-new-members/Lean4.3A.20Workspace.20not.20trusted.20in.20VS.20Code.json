Everything went fine until I clicked the “Install Lean using Elan” button in VS Code. At this point, my Norton 360 security software announced that Elan was behaving dangerously and the installation had been stopped. It gave me the option of completing the installation (which I accepted) but when I tried to run Lean in VS Code the server kept stopping.<br>\nLong story short: I finally managed to complete the installation, and I was able to get responses in VS Code to inputs such as #eval Lean.versionString, but anything more complicated than that just produced error responses, and the Lean server kept stopping. Now I cannot find any way to wake it up: VS Code just sits there and says “Waiting for Lean server to start”. <br>\nThe Troubleshooting section at the end of the installation instructions says that if this happens, I should try two things: <br>\n(1) Check that the VS Code Terminal is not showing some installation errors from elan. (The terminal is reporting that “No problems have been detected in this workspace”.) <br>\n(2) If that doesn't work, try also running the VS Code command Developer: Reload Window. (This produces a response that “the term ‘Developer’ is not recognised”.)<br>\nWhen I look in the VS Code Settings for the Lean4 Extension I find “This extension has been disabled because the current workspace is not trusted”.<br>\nI’m out of ideas. Can anyone help?</p>",
