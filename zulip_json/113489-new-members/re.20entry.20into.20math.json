I think we have quite some progress on C*-algebras and on Hilbert space theory. I don't think we have anything on unbounded operators (-Δ + V is an unbounded operator and there is lots of stuff in mathematical physics about abstract results for unbounded self-adjoint operators (and we don't even have the definitions for that)). As for books, there is the Conway's functional analysis book, there is monograph series by Reed-Simon and probably lots of other good books I am forgetting.</p>",
