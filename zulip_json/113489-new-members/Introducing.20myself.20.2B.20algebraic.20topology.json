I've been interested in theorem proving on and off for a while but never really dove into it. After reading a bit about Lean, and in particular the Xena Project and its goals around formalizing an undergrad math curriculum, I thought I'd give it a shot and contribute whenever I can. </p>\n<p>I've played through the natural numbers game, and I'm not sure where to go next. Probably more tutorials. For what it's worth, I worked a lot on (un)stable homotopy theory &amp; (co)homology operations, so I like homological algebra, spectral sequences, category theory, stuff like that. So I'd like to do something with algebraic topology eventually. Are classical theorems in algebraic topology feasible yet? If not, what needs to be done first? Does the Lean library (is that mathlib?) have a notion of (co)homology, (co)homotopy, etc?</p>",

I had a student who formalised group cohomology in Lean, so the system is certainly up to the job, but they have left mathematics now and so this work is unlikely to end up in Lean's maths library. However the library does have abelian categories and complexes, so all the machinery is there. No spectral sequences in Lean 3 yet. I will have an MSc student next year <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"118107\">@Amelia Livingston</span> who might do something related to the Auslander-Buchsbaum theorem (we're still not completely decided) so we will have to develop Ext and Tor in some generality. We have sheaves on topological spaces. I believe that <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"112680\">@Johan Commelin</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110032\">@Reid Barton</span> have thought about simplicial homology but I'm unclear about its status with regards to mathlib. In short, we don't have pretty much any of the stuff you are mentioning, however within the last year we have managed to build the machinery which one would need to make it, so there is plenty to do; it would of course be helpful if we could arrange things so that nobody is treading on each other's toes. There is a chance that <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"260921\">@Markus Himmel</span> will also be working in this area in Lean for his Masters project in Cambridge this coming academic year.</p>",
