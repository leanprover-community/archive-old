However, I cannot find these on the lftcm 2022 website, or anywhere online. <br>\n<a href=\"https://icerm.brown.edu/topical_workshops/tw-22-lean/\">https://icerm.brown.edu/topical_workshops/tw-22-lean/</a></p>\n<p>Were such files distributed to the participants, and if that is the case could they be made available online ? </p>\n<p>I ask this question because there is a repo containing the lean files of the earlier lftcm 2020 conference, which proved to be an excellent learning material.<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/lftcm2020\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/lftcm2020</a></p>",

As you can see by comparing <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad.html</a> and <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad_todo.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad_todo.html</a> we are doing a really bad job of formalizing even very basic numerical analysis. And Lean 4 will allow even nicer things in this direction, see <a href=\"https://github.com/lecopivo/SciLean\">https://github.com/lecopivo/SciLean</a> for a glimpse of the future.</p>",
