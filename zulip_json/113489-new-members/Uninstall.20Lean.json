I installed Lean some time ago (using <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/macos.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/macos.html</a>) and I have to admit I don't remember which version I installed or if was given instructions to uninstall at the time. I'd like to uninstall Lean to make sure my setup is clean before re-installing it (or a patched version of it). Is there a documentation on how to uninstall lean ?</p>",
