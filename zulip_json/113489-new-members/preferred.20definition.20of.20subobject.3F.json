Basically you have to know the \"code\" for a lot of the symbols and ideas used in Lean. For example the code for <code>∈</code> is <code>mem</code> and the code for <code>{x}</code> is <code>singleton</code>, so the lemma you want will be called something like <code>mem_singleton...</code>. The problem is there will be several lemmas about being an element of a singleton set, e.g. <code>x \\in {y} \\iff x = y</code>, so we will still need to look more.

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"268619\">@Alex Mathers</span> the other thing to say about subobjects is that there is no one right answer here. There is a PR to \"bundle subgroups\" <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/2140\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/2140\">#2140</a> by the way. But here is an issue. A normal subgroup is a subgroup plus some extra condition. So do we now bundle normal subgroups as well? If so, how do we prove that a normal subgroup is a subgroup? With the <code>class is_subgroup</code> approach we can use the type class system to do this. With the fully bundled approach, we will perhaps use the coercion system. But then if we want to prove that finitely-generated central subgroups are normal, and hence subgroups, we might end up with coercions of coercions of coercions etc. However my understanding is the community has decided that in the cases we understand best, the fully bundled approach is better than the <code>is_</code> approach (for reasons I perhaps do not fully understand, although the fully bundled approach does give you access to the powerful \"dot notation\", where you can write <code>H.has_one</code> for the proof that the subgroup <code>H</code> has a 1, and perhaps this was what swung it).</p>\n<p>Another approach is to fully bundle everything, and instead of having <code>(G : Type) [group G]</code> just have <code>G : Group</code> where <code>Group</code> is the category of groups. Again there are advantages and disadvantages to this. The community is basically trying to figure out the best way to do everything. When Lean 4 comes, the best way might change. Currently the approach seems to be to have more than one way to do things, which comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages :-)</p>",

Because of this, there is some definite agreement amongst the CS people that <code>group_hom G H</code> simply should not exist. But then there are issues with pushing forward and pulling back, e.g. <code>f.map</code> is the construction which sends a subgroup of G to a subgroup of H, except that it isn't: it's the construction which sends a submonoid of G to a submonoid of H, and one has to define e.g. <code>f.gmap</code> to push subgroups forward.

For <code>bot</code> it turned out to go much more smoothly to make it <code>{x | x = 1}</code> because then the kernel being the stuff which mapped to 1 was true by definition.</p>",
