I've recently started learning about Lean (I started with the natural numbers game, then did the tutorial project, and am now working through Theorem Proving in Lean), and I want to keep learning about it and also contribute to mathlib. I am also wondering if Lean is going to represented as a mentoring organization for this year's Google Summer of Code, since I would be very interested if so.</p>",
