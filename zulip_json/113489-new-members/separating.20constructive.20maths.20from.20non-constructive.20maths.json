I am aware that you can specifically label functions non-computable and introduce explicitly a classical locale to allow 'normal' maths flexibility (which is great).  But equally I am concerned that when I want everything constructive and/or computable that I might be importing something that uses non-computability or non-constructive proofs accidentally. How does Lean (3 and 4 if they are different!) handle this?</p>",
