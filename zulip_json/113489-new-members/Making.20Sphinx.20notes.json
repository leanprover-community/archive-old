Conceptually, creating TPIL went something like this:</p>\n<p>- install Sphinx<br>\n- run <code>sphinx-quickstart</code> to create the directory structure<br>\n- customize a few things: tinker with the settings in <code>config.py</code>, add Gabriel Ebner's <code>lean_sphinx.py</code> to enable the <code>Try it!</code> button and testing, and change the <code>Makefile</code> accordingly. (I also modified the template slightly with the file <code>_templates/navigation_without_header.html</code>.) IIRC, I also had to modify the Latex template to get fonts and unicode working right.</p>\n<p>So, one option is to do the same: do <code>sphinx-quickstart</code>, compare the resulting directory side-by-side with TPIL, and make the same or similar changes, as appropriate.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, installing Sphinx, copying TPIL, and replacing the content with your own should have the same effect. That is easier. The only advantage to the first approach is that it will give you a better sense of how you can configure things on your own.</p>",
