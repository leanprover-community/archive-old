Saw <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"228466\">@Chris B</span> do a presentation of using Lean 4 to verify the consistency of code with the corresponding law at ProLaLa on Sunday, and was impressed. Here to learn. Extremely limited functional programming experience (tried and failed to learn Haskell once), spend most of my time now in logic programming languages, and imperative microsimulation platforms. Noticing some opportunities to make small editing improvements to the documentation for Lean4. I'll take a look for a CONTRIBUTING. Any advice appreciated.</p>",
