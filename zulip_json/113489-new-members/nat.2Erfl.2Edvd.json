The natural place would seem  to be <code>data/nat/lemmas</code>.  As you can see, the proof uses <code>dvd_refl</code> which is the statement <code>n | n</code>.  However, this lemma appears in larger generality and is not imported by <code>data/nat/lemmas</code>.  Should the <code>nat</code>-version of <code>rfl.dvd</code> be also added?  Is there a reason that it is not there?</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"c1\">-- lemma to be extracted from PR</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">lemma</span> <span class=\"n\">nat_dvd_iff_eq</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">m</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ℕ</span><span class=\"o\">}</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"bp\">∀</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ℕ</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">m</span> <span class=\"bp\">∣</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"bp\">↔</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"bp\">∣</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"bp\">↔</span> <span class=\"n\">m</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span>\n<span class=\"o\">⟨</span><span class=\"bp\">λ</span> <span class=\"n\">h</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">nat.dvd_antisymm</span> <span class=\"o\">((</span><span class=\"n\">h</span> <span class=\"n\">_</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">mpr</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">dvd_refl</span> <span class=\"n\">_</span><span class=\"o\">))</span> <span class=\"o\">((</span><span class=\"n\">h</span> <span class=\"n\">_</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">mp</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">dvd_refl</span> <span class=\"n\">_</span><span class=\"o\">)),</span> <span class=\"bp\">λ</span> <span class=\"n\">h</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"kd\">by</span> <span class=\"n\">rw</span> <span class=\"n\">h</span><span class=\"o\">⟩</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">-- auxiliary lemma?</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">lemma</span> <span class=\"n\">rfl.dvd</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ℕ</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"bp\">∣</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"o\">⟨</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">mul_one</span> <span class=\"n\">_</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">symm</span><span class=\"o\">⟩</span>\n</code></pre></div>",
