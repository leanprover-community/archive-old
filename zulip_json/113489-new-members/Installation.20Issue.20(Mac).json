When I tried <code>/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover-community/mathlib-tools/master/scripts/install_macos.sh)\" &amp;&amp; source ~/.profile</code>, I got an error message so I instead tried to it step by step as detailed on <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/macos_details.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/macos_details.html</a></p>\n<p>When I tried to install elan in Terminal, it didn't work so I went to <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/elan/releases/tag/v1.0.6\">https://github.com/leanprover/elan/releases/tag/v1.0.6</a> to do it manually. However I don't think it worked because after successfully completing the other steps, my test file is not working in VS Code. I have attached screenshots of what it is showing in VS Code and the error message I get when trying to install using <code>/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover-community/mathlib-tools/master/scripts/install_macos.sh)\" &amp;&amp; source ~/.profile</code>.
