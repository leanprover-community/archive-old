It's difficult to provide instructions that will work for any scenario, but FWIW I'm willing to help in this chat so there's a record of it. The easiest way is to start by installing Anaconda (<a href=\"https://anaconda.org/\">https://anaconda.org/</a>). This should ideally take care of all the steps in the <code>Python 3.7</code> section of the install page. Then also install <code>nodejs</code> using the link just following the start of the <code>Install Lean-game-maker</code>section in the instructions. Don't worry about <code>pyenv</code> for now, as Anaconda will create a python <code>3.7.6</code> environment anyway; it will be called <code>base</code>. You should be able install in that environment.</p>",
