        "content": "<p>This is the normal behavior of <code>rw</code> (trying to call <code>refl</code> after doing its work). The natural number game uses a crippled version of <code>rw</code> that doesn't do that (for pedagogical reasons). But you began a new tactic block inside your proof and this brought you outside of the NNG-style tactic world.</p>",
