We've been working on  new tactic called polyrith which can solve polynomial equalities through polynomial arithmetic on the hypotheses. (This is similar in spirit to how linarith solves linear equalities/inequalities using linear arithmetic on the hypotheses). We think we are at a stage where I can make a pull request, and so I wanted to ask for access to do so. My github username is dhruvbhatia00. Thanks!</p>",
