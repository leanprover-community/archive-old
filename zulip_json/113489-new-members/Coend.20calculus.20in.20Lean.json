I am a <a href=\"http://tetrapharmakon.github.io\">category theorist</a> who recently started to study Lean, and I have watched a few videos of the LftCM series on youtube.</p>\n<p>I'm here because I got in touch with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110087\">@Scott Morrison</span> : I would like to define dinatural transformations and co/ends in Lean with the goal of certifying theorems proved via coend calculus. I have written a book on coends, and I believe that this project is feasible and a good service to the fast-expanding Lean community and to category theorists.</p>\n<p>It seems that the part of the category theory library in lean relevant to coends has still to be written. If this is correct, I'd like to do it myself.<br>\nI tried to do it in agda-categories, and decided, after a painful day of reading through the library, that Lean is much better suited for this purpose. <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span> </p>\n<p>If anyone is willing to collaborate on this project, and teach me something in that direction, hit me up!</p>",
