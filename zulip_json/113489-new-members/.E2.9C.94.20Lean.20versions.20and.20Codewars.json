Then next thing on that list is the lftcm2020 repo, which I think is a pretty good suggestion, it's kept up-to-date with mathlib and teaches some more advanced design ideas. And there are some videos online of the different talks (though it is intended primarily as interactive exercises) if you've done NNG and tutorials project you should be pretty happy with the monday/tuesday things from that week so you could start at <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/lftcm2020/tree/master/src/exercises_sources/wednesday\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/lftcm2020/tree/master/src/exercises_sources/wednesday</a></p>",
