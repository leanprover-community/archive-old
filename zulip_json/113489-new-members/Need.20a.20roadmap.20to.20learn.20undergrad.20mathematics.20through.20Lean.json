        "content": "<p>Hi Everyone, </p>\n<p>Very very excited to be here. I learned about Lean from a video by Quanta Magazine featuring Prof. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110038\">@Kevin Buzzard</span> . I got hooked immediately, and totally share the passion.<br>\nI'm currently teaching myself undergrad level pure mathematics, and of course I want to master the materials as quickly and thoroughly as possible just like everyone else here, and if I can use Lean to do exercises, that'll be perfect.</p>\n<p>I don't know if this question got asked before, but going around in lean community I couldn't find a clear path from beginner to advanced, or from freshman to senior, of getting through all the materials for a standard 4-year undergrad math major.</p>\n<p>I know there are a few <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html\">textbook-like introductions</a> on the community GitHub site, and  a <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad.html\">list</a> in mathlib, but they are not what I am looking for.<br>\nMIT's website has a <a href=\"https://math.mit.edu/academics/undergrad/roadmaps.php\">good example</a>. Here is a piece from their roadmap:</p>\n<p><strong>Analysis &amp; Geometry</strong><br>\nTier 1:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>- 18.100B Intro to Real Analysis\n- 18.700 Linear Algebra/18.701 Algebra I\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Tier 2:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>- 18.101 Analysis and Manifolds,\n- 18.102 Introduction to Functional Analysis,\n- 18.103, 18.104, 18.112, 18.152, 18.950, 18.994 ...\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Tier 3:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>- 18.125 Measure Theory and Analysis,\n- 18.155 Differential Analysis I,\n- 18.156, 18.952, 18.965, 18.966 ...\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>I am not studying with an advisor (maybe I should), and a good road map like this is how I make sure I cover all the materials I should. A clear way of integrating Lean into this road map is absolutely necessary for me, so that I don't have to spend too much time wondering which part of mathlib will be a good fit to do exercise with for the books I'm reading.<br>\nI know that I'm not a typical math student, but I guess not a lot of math students have advisors who know how to hand pick examples and exercises from mathlib either, so perhaps actually my need is more general than one person?</p>\n<p>When I first discovered lean, I was so excited, that I did nothing else but Lean for a week (well, that's a lie, I was also spending quite a bit of time setting up lean.vim or lean.nvim, with help from <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"321696\">Julian Berman</span> . But then I realized that I was falling behind on my study schedule, and I have to pause leaning a bit.<br>\nI would love to use Lean more if I don't need to slow down my study pace, and I'd love to hear what fellow math students, especially those in ICL (<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110064\">@Kenny Lau</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110044\">@Chris Hughes</span> , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"120256\">@Ali Sever</span>   ... ), have to say about their experience. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>Thanks a ton!<br>\nA.D.</p>",

I came across your workshop this morning and I am going to look into it more. It seems to me a great way to learn lean when one already understands the associated math, and I'm seeing if there's a way to do it in the other direction: learn basic lean and then learn \"standard\" mathematics by reading textbooks and doing corresponding lean exercises. With so many undergrad topics already in mathlib, this should be possible. </p>\n<p>I'm also interested in a bit more detail how your students go through their mathematics curriculum, and how heavily is lean involved in their education. Is it a standalone project of fomalising already learned math, or is it a more integrated daily tool, like sage or matlab? If this is documented in your Xena project, I'm sorry I didn't locate it.</p>",
