People do livestreams and chat about a lot of off-topic stuff, there's music and surprise haikus. I was on the server 24/7 over the summer but now I don't have time to police it so I closed it off. I'll DM you an invite to Xena BTW. I will be using it to teach my graduate course next term and so I don't really just want randomers spamming stuff. Have you done any Natural Number Game?</p>",
