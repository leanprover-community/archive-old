        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"321459\">@Damiano Testa</span>  This is my basic understanding of tactics, in case it helps:</p>\n<p>When you write a Lean expression, there are a few kinds of holes you can leave in your code to signal that Lean should, in some capacity, help fill in the details for you.  One example is a tactic expression, with the notation <code>begin tactics-separated-by-commas end</code> or <code>by single-tactic</code>.  Lean will defer dealing with these for as long as possible.  At some point, once it figures out the type that the tactic expression should have (for example, it might be inferred from the <code>lemma</code> statement), it enters tactic mode.  Tactic mode is a special imperative programming language for constructing proofs.  Each tactic in the tactic expression is executed sequentially, and the effect of each is to somehow modify the hypotheses and goals while, in the background, constructing the thing that should eventually replace the tactic expression itself.</p>\n<p>It turns out tactics are themselves Lean objects (though in the <code>meta</code> level), and you can compose tactics in different ways to produce new tactics.  We've seen <code>;</code>, which takes two tactics and produces a tactic that runs the second tactic on each goal produced by the first.  There's also <code>{ tactic1, tactic2, ..., tacticn }</code> which evaluates tactics sequentially, failing when the first one fails. There's <code>try tactic</code> to attempt a tactic, but not itself fail if the tactic fails.  There's <code>tactic1 &lt;|&gt; tactic2</code> to try the first tactic, and if it fails continue with the second.  And so on.  (These can be helpful for writing short proofs that involve lots of case analysis.)</p>\n<p>So, when you are using tactic mode to prove a lemma, you're writing a program that writes a program that represents a proof!</p>",
