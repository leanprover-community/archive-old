I imagine that there's some way to talk about this notion with what's already present, but I was thinking that it could be useful to add a direct way to talk about it to the API, particularly because the mean-square version (p = 2) is extremely useful for the Ito calculus, which itself might be worthwhile to add at some point.</p>",
