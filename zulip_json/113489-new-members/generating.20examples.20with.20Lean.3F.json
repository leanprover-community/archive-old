For instance, provided with some definition to perform a search for an instance (or witness) that satisfies that definition. My motivation for it is the following: I am searching for a meta-programming-like tool with high expressiveness that could capture higher order definitions to generate random examples and problems for students. I noticed Lean is used for undergraduate education (ref Xena Project) so it made me curious about it.</p>",
