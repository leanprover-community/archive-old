The \"obvious\" way to do this would be to find a function <code>(a : int) -&gt; (0 &lt;= a) -&gt; nat</code>, and in fact <code>int.to_nat</code> exists so I'll just use that (though it took me a couple of minutes to realise that it doesn't matter that this function does the \"be total by providing garbage output\" thing). However, the next \"obvious\" way to do this would be to define it by cases on the value of <code>f</code>, and then simply demonstrate the contradiction in the negative case; but I don't know how to get the <code>inspect</code> term into scope. If the function <code>to_nat</code> didn't exist, is there some way I could do the following? Of course I could do the provide-garbage-output thing myself by just using <code>0</code> instead of the <code>begin... end</code>, but it seems more helpful to indicate that the output <em>is</em> garbage by explicitly demonstrating the contradiction that produces the garbage.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">def</span> <span class=\"n\">f</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">nat</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">int</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span> <span class=\"c1\">-- and also somewhere I prove that 0 &lt;= f a b always</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">def</span> <span class=\"n\">padic_val_nat</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"n\">p</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">nat</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">nat</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">match</span> <span class=\"n\">f</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"n\">p</span> <span class=\"k\">with</span>\n  <span class=\"bp\">|</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">int</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">of_nat</span> <span class=\"n\">m</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">m</span>\n  <span class=\"bp\">|</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">int</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">neg_succ_of_nat</span> <span class=\"n\">m</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"k\">begin</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">have</span> <span class=\"n\">inspect</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">f</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"n\">p</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">int</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">neg_succ_of_nat</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"k\">by</span> <span class=\"n\">sorry</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">sorry</span>\n  <span class=\"kn\">end</span>\n</code></pre></div>",
