But the same definition doesn't work for noncommutative case.<br>\nI think the solution of this is to</p>\n<ol>\n<li>change the definition of <code>submodule.annihilator</code> to include the noncommutative case, and</li>\n<li>rewrite all the proof which use <code>submodule.annihilator</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Is this a correct way? Or maybe is there any simple solution?<br>\n(And I also wonder how to define <code>submodule.annihilator</code> so that part 2 becomes easier.)</p>",
