I'm trying to replicate this: <a href=\"https://galois.com/blog/2021/03/real-time-robotics-control-in-the-lean-language/\">https://galois.com/blog/2021/03/real-time-robotics-control-in-the-lean-language/</a> . i.e., running an Arduino robot with a Lean4 controller running on a raspberry pi. The issue I'm running into is it looks like there's no elan build for the pi's architecture (searches for an armv7 extension for elan). My brightest idea is to try to build elan locally. Before I go tilting at windmills, I was wondering if there was any documentation on this or if anyone had any experience? Thank you.</p>",
