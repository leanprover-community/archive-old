I have seen the proof using handle decompositions and the one by Conway. I'd consider myself at least decent at programming and have done a good chunk of the exercises in the \"tutorials\" project, but I don't have a clue yet as to how things are usually implemented in a maintainable way and what is already available in mathlib. Could someone give me a few hints to get me started? Specifically, it'd be useful to know where to start defining triangulations and how to explicitly construct the homeomorphisms. I realize that this is probably a huge amount of work, but I have time and motivation, and even if I didn't finish, something useful might come out of it anyways.</p>",
