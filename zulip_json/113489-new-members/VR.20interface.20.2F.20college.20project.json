I currently have a project for one of my classes where I have to build a VR game. I have always wanted to create a new medium for doing maths, and handling concepts through gesture and a Man-Machine-Interface rather than chalk and talk really feels like a promising idea. I humbly come to the Lean community for guidance, as I might not be the first with this dream. I am specifically reaching out to teachers/enthusiasts that have tried the current VR offerings for math lessons to give me a baseline understanding of the state of VR maths classrooms.<br>\nThank you !</p>",

Even if it might not be trivial to find ways to represent the most advanced mathematical constructs, I am fairly certain that most of undergrad arithmetic, pre-hilbertian algebra, real/complex analysis and probabilities/statistics could greatly benefit from a gamey interface.</p>",
