It's just as Kevin said, there was no reason to change it anymore, it does the job.<br>\nI remember there were some issues with Lean in other browsers, so I just wrote \"The games built with this library work best in Chrome and Firefox.\" in the readme file in github. I'm a bit busy at the moment and I'm not really an expert on javascript, so it may take me a while to figure out what's wrong. In the meantime, if you absolutely have to use brave browser, you can just choose the world/level in the url, like this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/?world=6&amp;level=1\">https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/?world=6&amp;level=1</a></p>",
