I'm in my last year as a postdoc at Northeastern University, and I usually think about things in the realm of algebraic geometry, representation theory, and integrable systems. I've been getting progressively more interested in Lean and Mathlib for about 2 years now (since I first heard about the liquid tensor experiment), but it was only in the last few months that I've decided to dive headfirst into it. I'm really interested in contributing, and I would love to join a team working on any of the AG parts of mathlib.</p>\n<p>I already have a small project that's in a really rough state showing that the homotopy_category of homological_complex's of a preadditive category is preadditive. It's basically done except for a couple sorry's where I need to think through some things about zero divisors, but it's VERY far from being nice and polished.</p>\n<p>I'm also really interested in using mathlib for teaching, and I've been running an undergraduate seminar here at Northeastern. It's something like the blind leading the blind, but I find the process of preparing for the next week's material has really helped me solidify my understanding. We're still pretty early on, but a link to seminar material is <a href=\"https://github.com/mpenciak/Lean-Seminar-Sp2022\">here</a>.</p>",
