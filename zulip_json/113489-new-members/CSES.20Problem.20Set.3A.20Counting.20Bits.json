It's a \"dynamic programming\" solution to that problem. It seems that recursive stuff can be proven using induction so I guess I have to use induction in one way or another but how do I represent the binary representations of natural numbers and how do I generate a list of binary representations of natural numbers in the range [1, n]?</p>",
