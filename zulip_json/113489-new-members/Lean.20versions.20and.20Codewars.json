It seems that Codewars uses an older version of Lean and/or mathlib. In particular, I was recommended Lean 3.20.0 and this <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/commit/da66bb81bf0466335bae82077f0c335dfe53aeb3\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/commit/da66bb81bf0466335bae82077f0c335dfe53aeb3</a> mathlib commit. How much is this obsolete? Will working with that force me to learn things that will be useless for me when working with the current version of Lean and mathlib?</p>",

I could work on finishing the remaining exercises in these two but I don't find it very rewarding anymore. On the other hand, contributing to mathlib is currently way beyond my level. Is there any tutorial of \"medium difficulty\" better than Codewars? What do you recommend?</p>",
