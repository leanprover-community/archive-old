I have some experience in functional programming and the Coq proof assistant and I'm currently very excited about learning lean! I would love to contribute to mathlib at some point, when I have acquired more lean experience. Does anyone know if K-theory has been formalized yet? I have not seen anything on it in mathlib. I wonder if the definition of the K-groups of a ring or a topological space would be a feasible project as of now.</p>",

I would imagine defining things like K1 of a ring and K2 of a field and proving basic properties about them would be easy, and doing K_n would be more challenging but not impossible. I'm talking about algebraic K theory, I don't know anything about topological K theory. I will remark that I had two students who formalised group cohomology with me in the past, first I had a BSc student who did H^0 and H^1 and proved the beginning of the long exact sequence, and then an MSc student who did general H^n. The combinatorics was fiddly but it worked out.</p>",

I've seen a lot of homotopy theory in the HoTT library for lean 2, like higher homotopy groups, the suspension functor, hopf fibration... All of which would be necessary for K-theory I suppose. I haven't found homotopy theory in mathlib, which surprised be as it seems like a pretty elementary notion.</p>",
