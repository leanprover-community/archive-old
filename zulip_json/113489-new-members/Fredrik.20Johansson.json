This should make it possible to export the data to computer algebra systems and theorem provers. As I said, I have not done any formal verification, but I have been able to test about 75% of the formulas using an automated framework which plugs in random values satisfying the assumptions and checks consistency using a combination of symbolic computation and complex interval arithmetic.
