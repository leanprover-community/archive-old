In a sense you can have \"multiple exact\" by providing a composite term in one exact. For instance, if your goal is a conjunction <code>P ∧ Q</code> and you<br>\nhave <code>hP : P</code> and <code>hQ : Q</code> in your context, you can use <code>split, exact hP, exact hQ</code> but you can also use  <code>exact ⟨hP, hQ⟩</code>.</p>",
