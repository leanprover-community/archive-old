Actually not exactly because for the ring you need that the integers are a ring while for the semi-ring you only need that the natural numbers are a semi-ring which is easier to prove. Actually how exactly are integers implemented in lean? Signed representation is good for computation but bad for reasoning, quotients are good for reasoning but bad for computation. In cubical you can have both...</p>",
