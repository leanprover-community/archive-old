Depending\n       on the transport protocol, some of this information may be absent.\n\n       Git supports ssh, git, http, and https protocols (in addition, ftp, and\n       ftps can be used for fetching, but this is inefficient and deprecated;\n       do not use it).\n\n       The native transport (i.e. git:// URL) does no authentication and\n       should be used with caution on unsecured networks.\n\n       The following syntaxes may be used with them:\n\n       路   ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/\n\n       路   git://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/\n\n       路   http[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/\n\n       路   ftp[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"251003\">@Sorin Suciu</span> are you saying that you're using a version of git which does not accept this git protocol?
