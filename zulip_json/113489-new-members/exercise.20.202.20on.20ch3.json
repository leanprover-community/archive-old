The one without seems like cheating, but shouldn't lean see that? Why did it work? Also when clicking around the commas in the tactics proof there seem to be special moments when lean creates multiple goals that are somehow identical (?) and then later they vanish. Specifically, this happens on the second line after <code> begin</code>. Some clarification on this would be great. I want to be able to appreciate odd proofs like this (if it even <em>is</em> a proof...).</p>",

Now I think I have proven it, but I don't understand how the <code> assume </code> tactic works.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span> example : ¬(p ↔ ¬p) :=\n  begin\n    intro h,\n      cases h,\n        let hp: p, from h_mpr\n          (assume hp: p,\n          have hnp : ¬ p, from h_mp hp,\n          show false, from hnp hp),\n        show false , from (h_mp hp) hp,\n  end\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>I seems to work within the parenthesis and I can then apply h_mpr on what \"resolves\" to be <code> hp: p </code> . It seems that what is within parenthesis is the \"construction\" of such a hypothesis, but it looks very odd. Is this correct?</p>\n<p>Also why can't I use <code> assume </code> outside of the parentheses? I imagine it is something like a \"namespace\" issue, but maybe some elaboration would be helpful.</p>\n<p>Additionally, lean seems to complain whenever <code>assume</code> is used <em>outside</em> of these parentheses, saying it expected a <code>let</code> statement. I figure this is some of lean's advanced pattern matching at work, but it seems bizarre that it can guess what you should write, but still allows you to either fail or write things some alternate, equivalent way. I imagine an explanation of the <code>assume</code> question above will help explain this situation too.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>",
