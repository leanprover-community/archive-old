If so, perhaps it would be useful to do this?  It looks like the lemma is from <a href=\"https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/natural_number_game/blob/master/src/game/world6/level8.lean\" title=\"https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/natural_number_game/blob/master/src/game/world6/level8.lean\"><code>game.world6.level8</code></a>.  Indeed, the <a href=\"https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/natural_number_game/blob/master/src/game/world7/level10.lean\" title=\"https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/natural_number_game/blob/master/src/game/world7/level10.lean\">source code</a> for the following level, Level 10 (which does use that lemma in its answer) imports <code>game.world6.level8</code> at the start of the file.</p>\n<p>(Or perhaps I have made a newbie mistake and this is a misunderstanding, or browser caching issue, or something.  If so, sorry!)</p>",
