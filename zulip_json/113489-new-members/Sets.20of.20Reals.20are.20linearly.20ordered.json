Inf seems to give less errors than min (at least I don't have to prove linear order now), but there's a type mismatch from my definition of a bounded sequence and also a placeholder synthesizing issue...

The error says what the problem with your code is.

The second input is in <code>[]</code> brackets so Lean will sort it out for you. The next input is a term of type <code>set α</code>. Conclusion: <code>Inf</code> is expecting to be fed a set. But you feed it <code>up_bounds (b)</code>. If you type <code>#check up_bounds</code> you see this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">up_bounds</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"bp\">Π</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">b</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ℕ</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">ℝ</span><span class=\"o\">),</span> <span class=\"n\">b</span> <span class=\"bp\">∈</span> <span class=\"n\">set_bounded_seq</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">set</span> <span class=\"n\">ℝ</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>So <code>up_bounds</code> first expects a function (which you give it), and then it expects a proof that this function is bounded and it will output a set. In particular, <code>up_bounds (b)</code> is a function which eats a proof that a set is bounded and returns a set, so it's not a set, and indeed this is exactly what the error says.</p>",
