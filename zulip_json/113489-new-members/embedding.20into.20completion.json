Changing <code>let</code> to <code>letI</code> should put the uniform space instance into the system and then things will work. But I'm not sure that this is what you want to do.

We haven't done much with separable spaces except in the integration theory folder and the API is still bad.

I know I'm having difficulties, it's why I came to the \"new members\" stream and said multiple times that I was having difficulties.</p>\n<p>I gave a three sentence proof of the result that uses the embedding, so no, I don't think I'm particularly confused on the math side, though honestly I don't work as a mathematician anymore, so I expect to be rusty about a lot of things.  I am not surprised that one can think about things in a different way that avoids explicitly relying on the embedding.  I feel certain I would have gotten there eventually, but I'm trying to first figure out how to do the things I want to do in Lean, and then learn (probably in a PR review) better ways of doing things.  A month or so ago I didn't know anything about using Lean at all!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You should still learn about coercions, by reading the relevant section of TPIL (you may need need to backtrack at least to the beginning of Chapter 10).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thank you, this is actually helpful.</p>\n<p>I think you should really reconsider how you interact with new members, because this was incredibly discouraging to come back to, and makes me not want to contribute.  I was asking for help, not asking for someone to do this for me.  And I felt talked down to not just on a Lean level, but on a mathematical level.</p>",

Of course injectivity is not necessary, since all I need is that the dense subset in the completion is countable.  I take your point that by focusing on the canonical embedding I perhaps was not looking for more general lemmas that would help, but what you actually said was that I was \"concentrating on completely irrelevant points\".  You said \"The main issue is mathematical.\" as though the short pen-and-paper proof I gave was somehow <em>wrong</em>.  It made me feel pretty bad.</p>",
