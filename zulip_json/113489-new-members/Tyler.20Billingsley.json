I've recently played through the Natural Number Game &amp; seen Kevin Buzzard's talks about the future of mathematics. This is my first experience with computer proof verification and I'm very intrigued to continue and possibly see how I (and/or students I end up working with, but for a very long time probably just I) could contribute to this project!</p>",
