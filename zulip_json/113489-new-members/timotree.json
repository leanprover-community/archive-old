I'm pretty new to maths, and I've been reading mathlib as a way to learn new concepts. I find it helpful because it's easy to find the fundamental definitions. For example, I have been interested to learn topology for a while, but mathlib was the first place where searching for \"topology\" actually led me to the definition of a topological space.</p>",
