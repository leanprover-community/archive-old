I know it is irrelevant for the math but it is such a pet peeve of mine!</p>\n<p>Does anyone else find it annoying? Or, on the contrary, do you prefer the definition as it is written? Sure, it has less parentheses, but my preferred version could also be written as <code>f a b = c  ∧ a ∈ s ∧ b ∈ t</code> which would combine esthetic benefits of both.</p>",
