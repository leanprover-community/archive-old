The plan is to show \"manually\" that the class number of ℚ(√-5) is 2, then hopefully that will teach us if and how Lean could do these calculations mostly automatically. So the topics you mention would be great to have soon, and I'm more than happy to help you with that. (Especially if I can take over your work in the case you can't finish it due to time/interest.)</p>",
