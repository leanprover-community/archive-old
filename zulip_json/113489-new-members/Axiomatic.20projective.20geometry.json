        "content": "<p>Hello.</p>\n<p>Here in Prague we start a new seminar on axiomatization of projective geometry (roughly along axioms by Veblen and Young , 1910 and 1917). I have quite extensive experience with Isabelle  but in this seminar we are toying with the idea to formalize the axiomatic system in Lean where we are all complete beginners. The ultimate goal is to show that the theory is complete and decidable, but the formalization would be interesting even without that. <br>\nIs there anything similar in Lean already? Both in the field of projective geometry, but also in the logical direction of showing any theory to be complete and/or decidable? I am superficially aware of a related work in Coq (GeoCoq), and I also found in the chat that in 2019 there were some plans to work on projective geometry.</p>\n<p>Any comment or suggestion will be appreciated.</p>\n<p>Stepan</p>",

This formalisation was itself adapted from a similar formalisation in Coq.</p>",
