Most my problem is that i dont understand the notation or sintax specially lines 10 and 11 exactly the letter \"h\", i read it seems like lambda abstractions. someone can explain me what are those \"h\" and what is an equivalence when write the same proof but in paper with pencil and erraser? <a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/wqZS35-ZLQBCqcLwjRwkSXc9/imagen.png\">imagen.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/wqZS35-ZLQBCqcLwjRwkSXc9/imagen.png\" title=\"imagen.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/wqZS35-ZLQBCqcLwjRwkSXc9/imagen.png\"></a></div>",

So we can work backwards, saying, I need to prove <code>a = b</code>. I also know that <code>injective f</code>, by the hypothesis I called <code>hf</code>.
