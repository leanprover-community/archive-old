Polish spaces are so named because they were first extensively studied by Polish topologists and logicians—Sierpiński, Kuratowski, Tarski and others. However, Polish spaces are mostly studied today because they are the primary setting for descriptive set theory, including the study of Borel equivalence relations. Polish spaces are also a convenient setting for more advanced measure theory, in particular in probability theory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So despite the name, I think they aren't as specialized as they sound. So yes, this would be good if it would help us to improve Lean's probability theory.</p>",

But it might take a bit of fiddling to get the definition correct, in the sense that it should integrate well with the rest of mathlib.
