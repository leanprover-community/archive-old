        "content": "<p>Hi everyone,<br>\nI'm wondering whether <code>ne_zero</code> (<code>n ≠ 0</code>) or <code>pos</code> (<code>0 &lt; n</code>) is preferable as results (or even inputs) of proofs involving <code>nat</code>. I think the naming conventions come from <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/naming.html</a>, An example might be something like <code>list.find (= 0) xs = some x → list.length xs ≠ 0</code>vs <code>0 &lt; list.length xs</code>.<br>\nSo my thoughts are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I think <code>0 &lt; n</code> relies on <code>has_lt.lt</code> whereas <code>n ≠ 0</code> relies on the simpler <code>=</code>.</li>\n<li>To extract the information out of <code>0 &lt; n</code>, I think you need to: <code>have h : 0 &lt; n := &lt;some proof&gt;, cases n, { cases h }</code>.</li>\n<li>To do the same for <code>n ≠ 0</code>, I think it's: <code>have h : n ≠ 0 := &lt;some proof&gt;, cases n, { contradiction }</code>. Which can be shorter or longer depending on <code>h</code>.</li>\n<li><code>pos</code> is shorter than <code>ne_zero</code>.</li>\n<li>There exists <code>pos_of_ne_zero {n : nat} : n ≠ 0 → 0 &lt; n</code> in the default standard library but I couldn't find the other way around or an <code>iff</code> (<code>↔</code>) version.<br>\nIn my opinion, <code>n ≠ 0</code> is easier to use? since I think lean can interact with it or see through the indirection better. What are your thoughts?</li>\n</ul>",

But isn't it equally principled to prefer the apparently weaker <code>n ≠ 0</code> in <em>assumptions</em> (we'd want assumptions to be weak, I guess). But requiring both will lead to a situation where the conclusions of lemmas/theorems are not directly what is needed as assumptions to other lemmas/theorems: one would need to pass them through something like <code>has_lt.lt.ne'</code>. </p>\n<p>(Winston's original question was of course phrased with a focus on results, but included also the case of inputs.)</p>\n<p>So is the recommendation to use the apparently stronger form in both conclusions and assumptions? Or is it to use the apparently stronger form in conclusions and the apparently weaker in assumptions, and to live with having to pass them through some additional lemmas inside proofs?</p>",
