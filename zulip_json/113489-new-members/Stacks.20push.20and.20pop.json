I'm totally new to LEAN and I started studying this language and trying to prove things, started by finishing some levels in Natural Number Game and also learning LEAN from the documentation, but now I have a task to do with Stacks, I have to create a Stack A and Stack B and then I push items to Stack A and pop them to Stack B to prove the last item remaining on top of Stack A ... can you point me to the right direction ?????<br>\nThanks a ton</p>",
