I was looking for more pleasing ways of expressing my functional code and I've found Lean (and Idris, and Coq and a bunch of others). Lean seems pretty good at describing what you want in a clear way and more importantly in a readable way.</p>\n<p>I've gone through the \"Functional programming in Lean\" book ('till chapter 3.3) and I'm interested in learning more.</p>\n<p>Especially, I'd like to ask (1) what other resources are there for someone to learn how to approach general programming with Lean and (2) if graded modal types \"Ã  la\" Granule are something describable within Lean.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",

Also, I often find it helpful in programming to just get started trying to do stuff.  So you could pick a set of learning problems like <a href=\"https://adventofcode.com/\">advent of code</a> or your own personal project.  A lot of stuff in Lean 4 isn't documented (or worse is changing), but if you look at the code, you can find a lot by looking how things are done there.  Also <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/</a> is useful.</p>",
