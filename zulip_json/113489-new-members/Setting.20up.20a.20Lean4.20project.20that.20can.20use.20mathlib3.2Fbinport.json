Or is my guess off?)</p>\n<p>I do want to help with the porting process,  and I'd like to help with porting tactics if I can—it might be a good way to learn! But separately, I'm also just looking to start formalizing some particular math in Lean 4 that will make use of mathlib imports (for which I assume I only need the binaries). (I eventually found <a href=\"#narrow/stream/287929-mathlib4/topic/using.20binport.20only/near/300929618\">this thread</a> and asked a more specific question there after attempting what I could.)</p>",
