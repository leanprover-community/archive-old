In fact both are  <code>solver.match_1  ... = tt</code>. Is there a way to get rid of these terms? So I end up with a hypothesis of <code>find_valuation (form.FAnd p1 p2)</code> and a goal of <code>find_valuation p1</code> or am I saying something ridiculous? </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I see the term _match_1. I assume this is introduced by a pattern match I perform in the solver definition. What exactly does this do?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",
