I notice that the <a href=\"https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/propositions_and_proofs.html#conjunction\">\"ASCII equivalents\"</a> <code>(|</code> and <code>|)</code> to the angle bracket notation don't seem to work in Lean 3.18.4; have those been removed entirely, or is there a newer ASCII syntax that I can replace them with?</p>",

Since you're much more skilled in both tools than I am, it would probably be much better and faster if you're the one who does it; the only progress I've made so far is setting up GitLab CI to automatically run the tests on each commit, and removing this one angle brackets example: <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/sestep/theorem_proving_in_lean/-/commit/b4cf0d31\">https://gitlab.com/sestep/theorem_proving_in_lean/-/commit/b4cf0d31</a></p>",
