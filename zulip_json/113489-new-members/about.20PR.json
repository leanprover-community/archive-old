But it seems like this might result in an unnecessarily large number of branches of mathlib. Is this an issue at all, if all my branches are in a \"subfolder\", say if all are of the form <code>kkytola/*</code>?

I <em>tried</em> to also merge <code>master</code> back to my branch before making the second PR.

Here I will be assuming that I just messed up something when creating two <em>consecutive</em> PRs from the same branch, and this otherwise this could have been done cleanly. But what is the best way to do multiple <em>simultaneous</em> (small) PRs? If it is desirable to avoid a large number of separate branches, how should this be done? I imagine there could be two different cases: simultaneous PRs that don't depend on each other (say touch different files that don't import each other), and simultaneous PR's of which one depends on another.
