I have a fairly strong mathematical but mostly CS (Haskell) background (<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"386930\">@Andres Löh</span> might remember me from way back when in the Generic Haskell days...). Nowadays I work in IT, but that's not going to stop me from tickling my brain from time to time; and Lean seems just the ticket. </p>\n<p>So to kick things off, I've got two questions; one CS-y and one mathematical.</p>\n<p>1: Is there a formal definition of the Lean language, something like to the Haskell reports? The sheer amount of syntax overwhelms me at times, but that's probably due to me not knowing the \"prelude\" by heart....</p>\n<p>2: How would I go about proving that a group with 4 elements is either isomorphic to Z_4 or Z_2 x Z_2? I've followed the 'Formalising Mathematics' series of blog posts by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110038\">@Kevin Buzzard</span>  up to week 6, but I don't even know how to state the hypothesis that the carrier is finite and has 4 elements. I also don't know how to construct cyclic groups or direct products. And finally I don't want to do a case analysis on the 4^16 possible multiplication tables :-)  I don't need (or want!) a slick proof, I just want to know where to start. ..</p>",

It seems a waste of namespace to have to use ≃, ≃+ and ≃foo etcetera, when  the operation is a parameter. I know there's a (rather brute-force) tactic that lifts multiplicative proofs to additive ones for groups somewhere, but it seems to me that once you want to express statements like the (x,inv,1/+,neg,0/foo,bar,baz) group on the left is isomorphic to the (x/+/foo) group on the right you get a quadratic explosion of statements, all rather devoid of content :-)</p>",
