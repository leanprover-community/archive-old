(I recognize that mathlib is an ongoing project, incomplete and imperfect, and that is just fine!)</p>\n<p>I would like to look at the <code>export.json</code> file that is constructed as part of the doc-gen process for mathlib.  <br>\n(That file is not the same as <code>export_db.json.gz</code>, which is a less-structured output from the next stage of the doc-gen process).<br>\nAFAIK I would need to install Lean and build mathlib before I could see export.json.    <br>\nI have not tried to do the full Lean install yet.<br>\nI will enjoy doing so when I can, but if anyone can help me skip ahead to see <code>export.json</code> sooner, that would be swell.<br>\nI presume it appears somewhere in this neighborhood during a build of the mathlib docs:<br>\n<code>/home/runner/work/doc-gen/doc-gen/mathlib/</code></p>\n<p>Additional background on where I am coming from, including discussion of the \"Mathematics Subject Classification\" (MSC) taxonomy and recent work on math knowledge mgmt., in the mathlib channel of the Xena Discord:<br>\nMay 23:  <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/679792285910827018/717708103059112007/846158094466547743\">https://discord.com/channels/679792285910827018/717708103059112007/846158094466547743</a><br>\nMay 29:  <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/679792285910827018/717708103059112007/848263391458230353\">https://discord.com/channels/679792285910827018/717708103059112007/848263391458230353</a></p>",
