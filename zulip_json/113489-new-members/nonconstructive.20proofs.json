Basically the solution I was told was to explicitly provide decidability instances rather than using <code>open_locale classical</code>.</p>\n<p>I don't really understand decidability,  but (now that I'm trying to use it appropriately) I just ran into a similar kind of problem with two superficially identical <code>ite</code> expressions with different decidability instances. It would definitely be very nice to have a way to do this that doesn't involve any decidability at all.</p>",

This is what you do in the other thread but you still seem to get into problems :-/</p>",
