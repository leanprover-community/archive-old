If so, how much space does that take up?</p>\n<p>The page for mathport mentions an alternative involving a lake dependency, but I don't quite understand the nitty-gritty of setting this up even after reading the README for lake (or what doing so would actually achieve, or even what being an \"artifact\" really means).</p>\n<p>If the size is prohibitive, is it possible to use VS code with remote repositories somehow to only download the binaries needed for a given project, instead of storing everything locally?</p>\n<p>I realize these questions are kind of scattered, and might be XY-problem-esque. Overall, though, any guidance or templates that help with the details of setting up a Lean 4 project that can use mathlib3 would be great! Thanks in advance!</p>",
