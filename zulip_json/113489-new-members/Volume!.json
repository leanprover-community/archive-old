I'm also co-author of a branch of HOL Light, HOL Light QE, that adds quote and eval to HOL Light.  Before that, and a long time ago, I worked at Maplesoft (makers of Maple) for 11 years. I was head of the Math Group for quite a few of those years, so I'm kind of a symbolic computation expert. And Chair of IFIP WG 2.11 on metaprogramming, so I guess I'm an expert at that too.  But a total novice at Lean.</p>",
