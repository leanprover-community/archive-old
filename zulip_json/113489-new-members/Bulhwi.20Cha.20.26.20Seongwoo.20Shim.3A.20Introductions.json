My research interests include designing non-traditional aircraft such as Urban Air Mobility (UAM). I'm also interested in tensor analysis.</p>\n<p>I set a goal of formalizing Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics in Lean. If I succeed, I hope to formalize other engineering subjects: mechanics of materials, thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, electromagnetics, and aerodynamics.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I can comment a bit about Hamiltonian mechanics: the correct way of formalizing that is through symplectic geometry (in a sense symplectic geometry is Hamiltonian mechanics). The geometry part has the problem that the theory of manifolds is not far enough yet. On the other hand, there is symplectic linear algebra (symplectic forms, the various subspaces of sympletic vector spaces, symplectic transformations, etc) and this is very much feasible. For instance the definition of the sympletic matrices was formalized by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"455674\">@Matej Penciak</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"513795\">@Fabien Cl√©ry</span> recently <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/15513\">#15513</a> (I might have helped a bit). For the abstract theory the starting point would be to look at this file <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/linear_algebra/sesquilinear_form.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/linear_algebra/sesquilinear_form.html</a> but if you want to contribute to mathlib in that direction please check with Matej first, I don't know what he is up to and whether he has code for that stuff.</p>",
