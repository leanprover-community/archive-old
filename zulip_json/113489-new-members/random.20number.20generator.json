        "content": "<p>I think in Lean 3  (this is Lean 3, right?), that <code>#eval</code> only runs deterministic pure code, so you can’t have a function which is random in there.  However, <code>main : IO unit</code> (which can be run from the command line) does allow nondeterministic code.  Also, tactics can be nondeterministic (but shouldn’t be for any kind of tactic you intend to use permanently in a proof).</p>\n<p>It would help if you explain the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem\">#xy</a> problem, namely what are you trying to use a random number generator for in Lean?</p>",

It explains the IO monad too.  (I however wouldn’t use their hack for random numbers.  I think there are better ways to get random numbers in the IO monad, although I’m not 100% sure.)</p>",
