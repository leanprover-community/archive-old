Also, because localized notations can be imported in a variety of contexts, there are some new best practices for them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>localized notations should always have a <code>(name := ...)</code>. Notation names are unrelated to declaration names, but the declaration name is a reasonable base for the notation name.</li>\n<li>localized notations should never use <code>_</code> in the notation, because this gets desugared to a unique metavariable index, meaning that the notation will not be recognized as a duplicate of itself if <code>open_locale</code> is used when the notation is already available. Instead, you should use the <code>hole!</code> notation, which unfolds to <code>_</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another major change is that projection notation (<code>x.foo</code>) now always instantiates implicit arguments with metavariables, which is consistent with Lean 4. To simulate the older behavior, one can use either strict implicit arguments for the structure field (e.g. <code>∀ {{n}}, p n</code> instead of <code>∀ {n}, p n</code>) or, depending on specifics, writing <code>λ _, x.foo</code> to ensure the implicit argument is preserved as an argument.</p>\n<p>Co-authored-by: Kyle Miller &lt;<a href=\"mailto:kmill31415@gmail.com\">kmill31415@gmail.com</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>Authored-by: <a href=\"https://github.com/digama0\">digama0</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/commit/3d7987cda72abc473c7cdbbb075170e9ac620042\">(commit)</a></p>\n</blockquote>",
