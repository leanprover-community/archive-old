There should be an explicit mention that powershell, mingw, cmd all don't work (but git bash may work for most operations).</p>\n<p>In the long run, leanpkg itself should potentially try to find out what shell environment it is started from and then avoid using \"test\", etc.. Getting it to work 100% with git bash would be a great intermediate step.</p>\n<p>A second comment I have is that users of a multi-user system often don't have the choice to avoid path names without spaces. They may be authorized to install programs in Z:\\Users\\Bob the builder\\Program Files\\ only. This is especially true for students.</p>\n<p>Third, these instructions should probably be very prominently placed in the manual (not via a link but the text itself).</p>\n<p>Many thanks for all the efforts!</p>",
