And sorry that I failed to follow it due to my poor knowledge about computer. This is a screenshot for that link. <br>\nSince I'm trying to open a file written by you, I guess it shouldn't be a bare file? Then, for the second one, which directory does it talk about and where should I running the code, git or VS code?</p>\n<p>I feel kind of guilty for asking this questions. Are there any videos about how to use lean for the first time which I can follow directly?
