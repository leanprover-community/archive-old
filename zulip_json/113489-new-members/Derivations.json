There is not any right? In case not should I start from scratch or is there some more general structure that I can get derivations as a particular case or some non obvious structure I can extend (with obvious I mean the ones one would clearly think about by looking at Wikipedia's definition)? I did not really work with anything in the algebra section so it'd be cool to listen to some tips before beginning</p>",
