        "content": "<p>I'm trying to formalize the proof that all terminating relations are normalizing (i.e. no infinite chains of a0 -&gt; a1 -&gt; ... implies every term has a normal form). The mathematician's by-hand proof is by contraposition which means I should be building an infinite chain of reductions anchored at a0 assuming a0 has no normal form.  On paper this is easy: You start with a0, since it has no normal form it is reducible to some a1. Since a0 has no normal form, a1 must be reducible to some a2, and so on. </p>\n<p>In the above proof, the necessary function from Nat to the domain of the relation is built inductively in tandem with the inductive argument that justifies the existence of each next step. I can't figure out how to do such a thing in Lean, or what else to do instead. I reach the following goal:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">A</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n<span class=\"n\">r</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"kt\">Prop</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n<span class=\"n\">a0</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n<span class=\"n\">ha0</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"bp\">∀</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">A</span><span class=\"o\">),</span> <span class=\"n\">refl_trans_gen</span> <span class=\"n\">r</span> <span class=\"n\">a0</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">Exists</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">r</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"o\">),</span>\n<span class=\"n\">G0</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">refl_trans_gen</span> <span class=\"n\">r</span> <span class=\"n\">a0</span> <span class=\"n\">a0</span>\n<span class=\"err\">⊢</span> <span class=\"bp\">∃</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">c</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">achain</span> <span class=\"n\">r</span> <span class=\"n\">a0</span><span class=\"o\">),</span> <span class=\"n\">true</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p><code>ha0</code> is the unfolding of the statement that <code>a0</code> has no normal form.

Second, I followed Reid's idea and I managed to get it to work! I suspect the need to manipulate <code>ha0</code> into the form suggested means I should consider restructuring some earlier definitions. Instantiating the existential with a structure was also a pain, but largely because I'm not yet comfortable with the <code>{x // ...}</code> notation, and other definitions didn't play nicely enough. </p>\n<p>Thanks all around for the help.</p>",
