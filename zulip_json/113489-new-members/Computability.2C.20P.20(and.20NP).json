We were wondering how exactly this process of development should go, as we feel this subject is something that eventually should be in mathlib.</p>\n<p>Right now, our questions are: when is a first version ready to be pushed to mathlib? There are already some definitions and theorems that we believe to be of interest, could they already be PR'ed? Is there stuff that we need to do before it's ready to be PR'ed?  Basically, this is something we're having fun with and want to continue, but we don't know how the process works exactly.</p>\n<p>For the interested reader, the state of the project right now: we have forked mathlib to <a href=\"https://github.com/pimsp/mathlib\">this repository</a>, and while this is very much a work in progress (we're doing a partial refactoring now), we currently have</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A definition of problem</li>\n<li>A definition of reduction</li>\n<li>A definition of computable (in polytime) (using Turing machines)</li>\n<li>\n<p>A definition of P<br>\nand the lemma's</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A proof that the identity is (polytime) computable</p>\n</li>\n<li>A proof that the problem on <code>bool</code> with <code>tt</code> being the only yes-instance is in P<br>\nAlso, on the TM front we're working on increasing the functional power of a Turing machine, for example by making a call stack and formalising libraries (both still very much a work in progress).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our goals (in order of short term to long term):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prove that the composition of (polytime) computable functions is (polytime) computable (this will give that a problem reducing to a problem in P is itself in P)</li>\n<li>Prove that all four problems on <code>bool</code> are in P</li>\n<li>Prove that is_even is in P</li>\n<li>Prove that is_odd is in P by giving a reduction to is_even</li>\n<li>Define NP (this should be very doable already)</li>\n<li>Show that P is a subset of NP</li>\n<li>Define NPC</li>\n<li>Enhance the functional power of Turing machines further</li>\n<li>Prove that SAT is in NPC</li>\n</ul>",

In general, working with <code>nat</code> is hard and ugly overall and requires a complicated pairing function, though it is possible (this was originally <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/13213\">#13213</a> before I gave up on that because the encoding function was already complicated, and it has a log-overhead which is still annoying).</p>\n<p>Instead, I've been working on using tree-based encodings. These offer several advantages: they are the most natural way to encode recursive structures, including lists; the pairing functions are non-arbitrary, and in particular, satisfy nice definitional equalities; and finally, they still are countable, and have a reasonable encoding/decoding to nat. The main disadvantage is that the literature usually uses nat, and that the existing infrastructure uses nat.</p>\n<p>I've started with the PR's <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/16715\">#16715</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/16415\">#16415</a>, after which <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/16416\">#16416</a> can go through (refactoring primitive recursive to use trees). Obviously this is a pretty big refactor but it is the only way I currently see to be able to define good encodings for objects that make polynomial-time things work.</p>\n<p>If anyone is interested in contributing to this project, DM me, because obviously things progress quite slow when it's just me.</p>",

outputs are logspace bounded in the input. There are some sorry's to fill in, but the essential idea is that the initial argument <code>list bool</code> is the read-only input, while the second argument is modifiable \"working space memory.\"  Here, we assuming the encoding of nat's uses the usual (efficient) base 2 encoding.</p>\n<p>We can easily modify the input to be a tree instead of <code>list bool</code> as well -- we just have to change <code>get</code> to return the <code>n</code>th node via <code>tree.get</code>. It's written with <code>list bool</code> here to more clearly distinguish the input from the working memory.</p>\n<p>The slightly tricky bit is with <code>iterate</code>. The idea is straightforward -- we can iterate a function with linear memory overhead until some condition is met. But this function might not terminate, even though we know the only way it doesn't terminate is if it repeats an input (since its range is finite for any particular <code>i</code> and <code>x</code>). Maybe there is a better way to state it, I'll have to think about it more/look at existing definitions of L in the literature.</p>\n<p>I do believe that this is contained in <code>L</code> and contains all decision problems in <code>L</code>. Intuitively, given a TM, we can write the step function using the constructors other than iterate and then call iterate to run the Turing machine (and the condition for iterate is satisfied if the TM runs in log space).</p>",
