And it would not <em>just</em> be about giving the definitions of the distributions: probably one would want to prove a few properties about each distribution to stress test the implementation of the definition. (Say, provide some lemmas about characterizations, at least the cdf and perhaps characteristic function and more interestingly specific ones for each distribution, lemmas about properties such as expected value and variance, etc.). Also many distributions would probably be defined by specifying either their densities or characteristic functions (the latter of which admittedly don't exist yet), so they would serve as tests for parts of the existing library (integration, perhaps Radon-Nikodym theorem, perhaps the still-non-existent characteristic functions, ...). Depending on the background, all of this this might be quite nice!</p>",
