But I have two questions:<br>\nQuestion 1: It's about deleting Git, Git Bash and Python after installing. I don't use Git , I don't  use Python as programming language. I don't understand one step after installing extension in VS Code: On Command Palette you need type Select Default Profile and choose Git Bash. I won't do this yet, but Lean works, I've tried some code. What does it mean and if it's not necessary to choose Git Bash can I delete it? Can I delete Python or works of Lean depends on Python?<br>\nQuestion 2: For example, I want to install Lean on computer without an access to Internet. I can copy VS Code,  extension for Lean, Python (if it need) from USB-disk on that computer. But how to install Lean Prover itself? What files I need?</p>",
