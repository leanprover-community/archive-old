In Lean 3 you seem to have at least the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>assume h: p, t</code></li>\n<li><code>have h: p, from s, t</code></li>\n<li><code>suffices h: p, from s, t</code></li>\n<li><code>show p, from t</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>So far I have identified the following equivalents for lean 4:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>fun h: p =&gt; t</code></li>\n<li><code>have h: p := s; t</code></li>\n<li><code>suffices h: p from s; t</code></li>\n<li><code>show p from t</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Is it just me or are these constructs more inconsistent? The Lean 3 syntax seems much more readable and many of the constructs even have much nicer shorthands (e.g. omitting the colon in <code>have : p from s</code>). Does anyone know the reason for this change? Is it just temporary?</p>",

I'm worried that if everyone invents their own notation for things like this it makes it harder to collaborate. I am saying this as a complete beginner, but I believe it is better to have common notational conventions like this be a part of the standard library. Unless of course, this sort of notation is now less popular?</p>",

Though with Lean you kind of have two standard libraries, core Lean and mathlib, and it might be possible for mathlib to add in the future notations beyond core Lean. For example I see <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/master/Mathlib/Tactic/Basic.lean\">Mathlib4</a> adds a \"lemma\" command as an alias for \"theorem\" since \"lemma\" is gone in Lean4, so maybe we'll have some more notations like the ones you mentioned once mathlib is ported (but commas probably won't make a reappearance).</p>",
