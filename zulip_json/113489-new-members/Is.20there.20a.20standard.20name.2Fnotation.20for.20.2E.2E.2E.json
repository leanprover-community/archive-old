This is a distinct question from the one kindly answered there. That one reminded me that groupoid was the right answer. This one is asking for the standard name of a particular groupoid, namely  the groupoid of affine coordinate space isomorphisms over an underlying (generally coordinate-free) affine space, S.</p>\n<p>Love this community,<br>\nKevin</p>",

In which case I guess I can just make up a notation/name, e.g., AI(S). If you or anyone else has a better name for it, I'd be happy to consider swapping in suggested alternatives. Thank you, again. --Kevin</p>",
