I don't know enough about Lean 4 to explain the difference between what is in core and what is in std4, beyond the assertion that what's in core is the bare minimum that is needed to get Lean up and running as a programming language and prover. </p>\n<p>The mathematics library is in the process of being ported from Lean 3 to Lean 4. It's here <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4</a> and you can find information about the Lean 3 version here <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/</a> , although much of what is explained there (e.g. about how much undergraduate mathematics is in the library) does not yet apply to mathlib4, although it will do one day.</p>",
