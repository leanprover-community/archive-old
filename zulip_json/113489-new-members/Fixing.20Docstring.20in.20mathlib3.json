I spot some typos in the docstring. </p>\n<p>For example, this one <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/algebra/order/monoid/lemmas.html#add_eq_add_iff_eq_and_eq\">#add_eq_add_iff_eq_and_eq</a> has the same docstring as the above one <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/algebra/order/monoid/lemmas.html#mul_eq_mul_iff_eq_and_eq\">#mul_eq_mul_iff_eq_and_eq</a></p>\n<p>And this one <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/algebra/order/monoid/lemmas.html#contravariant.to_left_cancel_semigroup\">#contravariant.to_left_cancel_semigroup</a>. The docstring is talking about right cancel right?</p>\n<p>Happy to help fix these docstrings. The first one is not trivial to me as the source uses <code>@[to_additive]</code> to autogenerate that theorem?</p>\n<p>As this could be the first time I raise a PR on mathlib, following <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/index.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/index.html</a> I post here for advice on how to do that. Thank you guys in advance!</p>",
