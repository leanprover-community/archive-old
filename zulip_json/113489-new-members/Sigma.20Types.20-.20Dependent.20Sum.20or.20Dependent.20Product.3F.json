Here we will mention just one more important and illustrative example, the Sigma types, Σ x : α, β x, sometimes also known as dependent products. These are, in a sense, companions to the Pi types. The type Σ x : α, β x denotes the type of pairs <a href=\"http://sigma.mk\">sigma.mk</a> a b where a : α and b : β a.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As I was trying to develop my intuition for Sigma Types, I came across the following two links.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/dependent+sum+type\">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/dependent+sum+type</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/dependent+product+type\">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/dependent+product+type</a></p>\n<p>Here, it seems like Sigma types are classified to be under dependent sum type. </p>\n<p>I was wondering which one is correct?</p>",
