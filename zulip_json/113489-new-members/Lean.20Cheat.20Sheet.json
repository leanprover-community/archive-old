I'm motivated to create a prototype and a skeleton for Lean based on it, at least cover the part I know of, distilling information from the books/tutorials that I've read. Just post here (before I even start doing so) to see if anyone has some plans/needs similar in mind.</p>",

I'm constantly confused about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Direction: what does the tactic applies to? the goal, the hypotheses, or both? Which tactic should I use if I need to do the same to the opposite direction? (backward proof v.s. forward proof)</li>\n<li>Scenario: under what specific circumstances should I think about using the tactic?</li>\n<li>Scope: what family does the tactic belong to? what scope of the problem does the family solve? (This is partially addressed by the tags, I'll get back to its issues later)</li>\n<li>What: what does the tactics do?</li>\n<li>Variants: are there slightly modified versions to also do xxx, yyy?</li>\n<li>What else: what else can I try in a similar circumstance? (it's like an ordered tactic chain, such as <code>ac_refl</code>, <code>cc</code>, <code>abel</code> etc., one stronger than the other)</li>\n<li>Style: which tactics to use if I want to do the same in another proof style? </li>\n<li>Reduce: what if I want to have more control on a tactics that's too smart? (such as from <code>simp</code> to <code>squeeze_simp</code>, <code>simp_only</code>, <code>rw</code> etc.)</li>\n<li>Simplify:  how can I simplify a series of steps( which seem to have a pattern ) to just one or few tactics?</li>\n<li>Partners: which tactics should I use together with this tactic?</li>\n<li>Parameters: what parameters can I pass to the tactics? what do they control? can I just copy-paste a part of the expression? why sometimes copy-paste doesn't work? when can Lean infer them for me?</li>\n<li>Equivalents: in informal mathematical proofs, in Coq etc. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>These questions are usually addressed by searching mathlib source for examples and searching Zulip for Q&amp;A, and most tutorials answered some of them.</p>",

Also, feel free to chime in on PRs on mathlib if you think the documentation can be improved.</p>",
