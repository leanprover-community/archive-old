But I also want to use some stuff from <code>algebra.ring.basic</code>, which when imported, also imports the library definitions of <code>even</code> and <code>odd</code>. But this is not possible in lean it seems. Cant I rename stuff on imports or only import certain names? Or how can I solve this?</p>",
