A subset of X is an object Y and an injection from Y to X. A quotient of X is an object Y and a surjection from X to Y. For example the even integers are a subset of the integers, but the integers modulo 10 are naturally a quotient of the integers. You can think of them as a subset but this isn't such a cool way of doing it because 7 and 8 are integers mod 10 and their sum in the integers mod 10 is 5, but their sum in the integers is 15, which means that the injection doesn't preserve addition but the surjection (sending every integer to it's reduction modulo 10) does (as 15 gets mapped to 5).</p>",

For example you can put a relation on the naturals saying that a and b are related if they end in the same digit. The corresponding quotient would be the integers modulo 10, and the surjection from the  integers sends two integers to the same residue class iff they end in the same digit.</p>",
