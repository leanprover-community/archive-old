Currently my strategy to get a feel of how things work is to find a pre-existing proof in mathlib that resembles what I am trying to do and adapt it.</p>\n<p>That being said, I would much prefer seeing examples of the lemmas that seem like they could do the trick in action. E. g. is there any way to find proofs that use, say, le_Sup? This would help me understand how it is used.</p>",
