Files that don't contain the words 'cast' and 'bits' tend to be more beginner-friendly and also you don't want to have a &gt;500 lines file, that tends to get messy.<br>\nOne good option would be <code>data.rat.lemmas</code> or even shorter <code>Order.Monotone.Odd</code> (it is only 58 lines).</p>",
