I have been experimenting with Coq for a while -- actually I assigned some optional Coq exercises to my undergraduate real analysis students last semester, and learned a lot myself in the process.  I am excited to try Lean!  At the moment I am doing Patrick Massot's tutorials (with an eye to adapting them for my own teaching), and learning my way around mathlib.</p>",
