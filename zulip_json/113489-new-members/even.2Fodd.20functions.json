Any such map decomposes the module into a fixed part, and an anti-fixed part. For even functions (the fixed part) the involution is (lambda x, f x) -&gt; (lambda x, f -x). (Sorry, on mobile)</p>",

To statethe theorem that every function is even+odd you would need an addition and to prove it you'd need an action of the integers on the codomain and the fact that 2 acts invertibly (eg it could be a module for a ring in which <code>is_unit 2</code>)</p>",
