I'm new to Zulip and fairly new to Lean.  I've been coding up some definitions and theorems on (multi)graphs, morphisms and isomorphisms from my 3rd-year course with the vague aim of getting students to play with some of these (e.g. as a \"graphs game\" like the natural number game).  Thanks to all for the inspiring work you've done so far.</p>\n<p>Anyway, if anyone is interested my approach is here: <a href=\"https://github.com/barriecooper/lean-graphs/\">https://github.com/barriecooper/lean-graphs/</a>. Feedback is very welcome (like I said, I'm fairly new to Lean).  Thanks also to my colleague Gihan Marasingha for encouraging me to post something here.</p>\n</blockquote>",
