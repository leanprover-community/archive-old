I am using VS Code as usual and opening a lean file, with nothing but a <code>import data.nat.basic</code> and a simple <code>example</code> (with <code>sorry</code> sindie), but then it suddenly started lagging, and not showing any info on the lean info screen on the right. Then I looked at the bottom left corner, and it says \"Lean: 163386 (checking project files)\". Any idea what might be happening? It is also using 700% CPU in my <code>top</code>.</p>",
