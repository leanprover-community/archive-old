        "content": "<p>I'm afraid I have no idea how to use Github and I am not very experienced with computery things like Homebrew but I can try to give more detail if that is okay. </p>\n<p>Basically the issue was I had the M1 version of Homebrew installed but Lean required me to use the intel version. The link I copied into my initial reply was the instructions I followed to install Homebrew again. After I did that, the command that does everything in one didn't work, so I again had to follow the step by step page. I'm afraid I can't remember how I finally got elan to work but I know I also had issues with gmp as I kept getting errors saying directory not empty; I fixed this by manually going into the folder and deleting what was in it (I know that was a bit risky!). At one of the stages I also kept getting the error <code>Error: An unexpected error occurred during the 'brew link' step: The formula built, but is not symlinked</code> but I fixed that using brew link.</p>\n<p>I'm sorry this isn't enough detail to instruct others, unfortunately my understanding of Terminal and Homebrew etc is not strong enough to understand exactly what is happening at each stage, and I didn't note down what my problems were. I hope this helps anyway!</p>",
