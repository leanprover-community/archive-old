I have been through a quarter or so of Software Foundations with Coq, but I'm very much a beginner with Lean. I am not a mathematician, formal math education ended for me with Calc 2 ~15 years ago. I don't really want to be a bother but I do have some questions about what is going on in some of the levels of the game. Is there a place for very beginner-ish questions?</p>",
