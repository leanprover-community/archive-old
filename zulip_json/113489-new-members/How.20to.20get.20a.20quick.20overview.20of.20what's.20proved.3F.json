        "content": "<p>Hi, I'm new to Lean.  Specifically, I'm working my way through Chapter 3 of  \"Theorem Proving in Lean\" at the moment, having also installed mathlib and and the <a href=\"https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/xena-UROP-2018\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/xena-UROP-2018\">xena-UROP-2018</a> work in progress.  Is there an efficient and meaningful way to get an overview of what has been proved in Lean to date?   I've run <code>find ./ | xargs grep \"theorem\"</code> in the <code>mathlib</code> directory, and adding a <code>grep -c \".\"</code> tells me roughly how many theorems have been proved, but the data is otherwise a bit hard to navigate.  It occurs to me that perhaps this question is most conveniently asked relative to some extrinsic knowledge base or bases, though something intrinsic, like the <a href=\"http://fcgp.sourceforge.net/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fcgp.sourceforge.net/\">pictures of the Linux Kernel</a>, would also be interesting.   In addition to studying the TPiL book,  it's also nice to learn by reading the source.  I look forward to getting to the point where I can contribute!</p>",

        "content": "<p>Brief overview: it's a bit random. Let me stick to maths. For example in ring theory we have rings, modules, and for commutative rings we have localisation, tensor products, and some stuff about Spec of a ring. There's currently a debate ranging about what the correct definition of Euclidean domain should be. For vector spaces we don't even have the equivalence between finite-dimensional vector spaces and k^n and all the consequences (linear maps = matrices etc); we don't have det(AB)=det(A)det(B) or anything like that -- we don't have signature of a permutation. On the other hand we have a bunch of stuff on Pell's equation and on Matiyesevich's proof that Diophantine = r.e. . For measure theory there is a whole bunch of stuff on measurable subsets of the reals -- however we don't have the definition of a differentiable function from R to R. No exp or sin or cos (although there is a PR), no proof that exp is continuous. I should say that I'm sticking here to what's in mathlib -- there are a bunch of random other things floating around, e.g. I have some repo which claims to define schemes (and even prove that an affine scheme is a scheme), and a bunch of students at Imperial College are working on completely random things (like finite-dimensional vector spaces, Sylow's theorems [done], fundamental groups). We're trying for perfectoid spaces but it's been slow going recently.</p>",
