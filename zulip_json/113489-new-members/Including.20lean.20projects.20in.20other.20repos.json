However, since <code>leanproject new</code> creates its own git repository, git won't let me add the directory. Will it work if I simply delete the git info in my project? I understand git submodules are a thing, but from what I have read, that doesn't seem to be what I want. For example, I would much prefer that updates to my Lean project resulted in updates to the larger repo (since there are no dependencies). </p>\n<p>I would appreciate any advice for how to manage this.</p>",
