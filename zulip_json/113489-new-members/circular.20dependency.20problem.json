I have file <code>bernoulli_polynomial.lean</code> depending on <code>bernoulli.lean</code>. Some lemmas I moved from <code>bernoulli</code> to <code>bernoulli_polynomial</code>, because the new proof depends on stuff from <code>bernoulli_polynomial</code>. However there are some other lemmas in <code>bernoulli</code>, which depend on the lemmas that I moved to <code>bernoulli_polynomial</code>.  Should I then just move all the stuff that depends on the moved lemmas to <code>bernoulli_polynomial</code>as well or is there a better way of doing it?</p>",

If you anticipate that we may add a lot more to <code>bernoulli_polynomial.lean</code>, it may make sense to create a 3rd file specific to Bernoulli power series and stuff that depends on those definitions, and at that point we may want to create a directory <code>number_theory/bernoulli/</code> and rename <code>bernoulli.lean</code> to <code>bernoulli/basic.lean</code>, etc.</p>",
