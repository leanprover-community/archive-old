        "content": "<p>To answer your Q1, </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09336\">The Lean Mathematical Library paper</a> is probably the best document on the design of the algebra library, particularly \"4 Type Classes\" and \"5 Linear Algebra\", they explained the design rationale and how it leverages the features available in Lean.</li>\n<li>I also like \"3 Lean and its Mathematical Library\" in the paper <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12320\">Formalising perfectoid spaces</a>, the introduction is concise and exactly for the purpose of explaining the infrastructure to formalize a theory. You'll probably found some other interesting introduction on this in other formalizing papers, that's one good thing that a paper is mandatory to explain some backgrounds, you get a dedicated crash course usually more suited for the preparation to doing something than a general textbook or reference. </li>\n<li>\"2. The Lean interactive theorem prover\" and \"3. The Lean mathematical library\" in  <a href=\"https://pp.ipd.kit.edu/uploads/publikationen/himmel20bachelorarbeit.pdf\">Diagram Chasing in Interactive Theorem Proving</a> is my favorite just found very lately, it has really thorough explanation on developing a theory and proving things about it, it also completely weaves the Lean code with the usual math natural language expression together.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There're usually more than one way to formalize a piece of mathematics and you would not truly know the limitation of an approach until you hit a hard roadblock later when trying to prove something or state something in a natural way. So there would be quite some trial and error involved in the process. I recall an old Zulip chat said that you can only know how to do it right unless you have done it wrong many times. (And internalize such best practices or some intuition during the process)</p>\n<p>Because a good definition can only be learned by bad proofs, it's important to sharpen the proving skill first (or at the some time) when you try to state some definitions and theorems for some mathematics. As a practice, groups etc. are good because they are well known and just abstract enough, but I would recommend something that's not in mathlib yet, such as the todo ones in <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/overview.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/overview.html</a> and try to do them in a similar way as the adjacent mathematical structures that's already in mathlib.</p>\n<p>If you're particularly interested in group theory etc. , you might want to try and improve the <a href=\"https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/group-theory-game\">https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/group-theory-game</a> . But in general, <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/\">#mil</a> is a really good practice which is quite evenly for different areas of (elementary) mathematics so you'll get a hang of anything you might be interested to do very quickly. And to answer your Q2, I guess not, <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/\">#mil</a> emphasize tactics for proving and not how to develop a theory (but I also don't know a general good guideline for that except reading the docs of existing formalized math).</p>\n<p>And the last two paragraphs might have partially answered your Q3.</p>",
