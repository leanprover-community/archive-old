I used leanpackage to just get the most recent community version of Lean (3.16.2, I believe) and when I type the following line : <code>variables (real : Type) [ordered_ring real]</code> I get the above error. I believe I have fixed things by downgrading lean via the leanpkg.toml file, so it should work for now.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to make this work with the more recent community release, though? Did the syntax just change? Is a new <code>open</code> needed now? Thanks!</p>",
