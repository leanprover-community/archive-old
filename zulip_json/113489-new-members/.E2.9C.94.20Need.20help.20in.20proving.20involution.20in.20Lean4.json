I actually realised why I wasn't able to apply any tactic, I wasn't using <code>by</code> I somehow forgot that I need to add <code>by</code>. But I also didn't know about the functional program proof using <code>match</code>.  Also  thanks for explaining the <code>Decidable</code> typeclass. </p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110038\">@Kevin Buzzard</span> , yeah I think I need to work through the exercises. Thanks for pointing out where std4  is I've starred your message to remember what the name is</p>",
