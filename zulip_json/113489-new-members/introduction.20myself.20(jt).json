I have been nosing around the website for a while and thought maybe I should introduce myself. I am currently working through the tutorial. I have in the past played around with coq, using <a href=\"https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/\">https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/</a>, but saw a talk by Kevin Buzzard (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp-mQ3HxgDE\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp-mQ3HxgDE</a>) that pulled me over to Lean. I don't have some grand picture of what I want to contribute, so I am happy to take a look at some of the \"boring but not too hard\" things others just haven't had time for. My PhD work involved algebraic topology, homotopy theory, operads and the like. Those are my interests mathematically, but I also have quite a bit of programming experience now, so I feel there are many ways I can contribute. Anywho, I'll just keep working through the tutorial. If anyone has any suggestions of low-hanging fruit, I'd love to contribute sooner rather than later.</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"Dp-mQ3HxgDE\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp-mQ3HxgDE\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/cff6ae37ab54c74b0cd0ff1841d8d8ad7de97622/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f44702d6d513348786744452f64656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div>",

Anyway, I can move it if need be.</p>\n<p>Main points:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Had a lot of trouble getting types to line up for alg_hom versus ring_hom and for with_bot \\nat versus \\nat. I would love some help on how to handle this better. Currently there are simple lemmas added in a couple places since that is the try among dozens of things that actually worked. </li>\n<li>Have annihilating_ideal defined. The names are pretty long. I see abbreviations are common in the code, but a lot of them don't make sense to me so I think I need some help on how to name things better.</li>\n<li>I just covered the very basic goal of showing that the minpoly generates the annihilating ideal in the \\bbk [x] case. Surely there are some other things I can add to fill it out a bit more.</li>\n<li>Proofs use only the few tactics I know. They appear longer and accomplish less than most other proofs I have seen. I don't mind it though. I like running through the tactics when they do a little bit at a time. It is fun.
