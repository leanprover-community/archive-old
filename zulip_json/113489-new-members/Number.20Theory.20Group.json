The main steps here would be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ruzsa Triangle Inequality</li>\n<li>Petridis' proof of Plunnecke inequality</li>\n<li>Ruzsa covering lemma</li>\n<li>A couple of elementary facts about vector spaces, that hopefully are already in Lean somewhere anyway.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think probably formalising a proof of the Ruzsa Triangle inequality would be both very useful, and also a not-too-difficult exercise in learning how to use Lean beyond the tutorials you mentioned.</p>",
