I'm a programmer, not a mathematician, and in the search for the right hypothesis checking system, I was only able to gain a foothold here, because all the others were written by mathematicians for mathematicians. However, before I delve into the subject further, I would like to know whether it is really the right tool for me. My work is not about testing mathematical theorems, but rather determining various hyphoteses about certain series of numbers, for example on {1,5,2,8,7 ..}, whether and how often n(x) is even if n(x-1)-n(x-2) &gt; 3. Is it possible with Lean? If not, can you recommend the right tool for me?</p>",
