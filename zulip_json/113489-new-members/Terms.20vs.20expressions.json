What exactly a type is beyond being a term is hard to pin down precisely, an explanation I've seen working well for beginners is to handwave it and say \"its like a set\" although this is of course a lie (that tends to work out well for a while), otherwise we could be doing just set theory</li>\n<li>expression should be disconnected from term and be used a Lean meta programming term (pun intended) we probably don't want to tell new comers right away</li>\n<li>an identifier is a name that has a type attached, identifiers are one of the many kinds of terms.</li>\n<li>object can be seen synonymous with term, we could get rid off it but mathematicians like to talk about mathematical objects and for OOP programmers it is nice to have some familiar name</li>\n<li>variables are placeholders, like in regular mathematics</li>\n</ul>",
