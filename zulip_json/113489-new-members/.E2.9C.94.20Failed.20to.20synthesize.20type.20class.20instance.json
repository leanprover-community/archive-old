        "content": "<p>Learning quickly the difference between a type and a term is useful, and knowing which universe things are happening in is also useful (I tell my students that there are two universes, <code>Prop</code> and <code>Type</code>, although you seem to have already discovered that in fact there are infinitely many universes <code>Type u</code> indexed by the naturals; my feeling is that this is to a large extent of the axiom in type theory saying that everything must have a type, even <code>Type</code> itself; I am not sure this is relevant to mathematics until you get to e.g. etale cohomology and start having to worry about taking limits over things which are not sets). I don't know why we don't have a <code>Prop</code> stating that a type is finite; people have often talked about adding it but it hasn't quite happened yet. </p>\n<p>The type/term thing is happening because \"a subgroup is not a group\". A subgroup of G is a term, of type <code>subgroup G</code>. Of course one sometimes wants to make it into a group, and one does this using that \"promote a term to a type\" up-arrow which you might have spotted in your version of h2: <code>G ≠ ↥(subgroup.center G)</code>.  I suspect that even if G were abelian, <code>h2</code> might still be true, although it would probably also be unprovable. The problem is that if you take a type and then start playing around with it, making it into a term and then back into a type, the new type carries the same data as the old type but it's all wrapped up in a different way so it would probably not <em>equal</em> to the old type. An example which is perhaps less weird would be the statement that if you take a ring <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">R</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.00773em;\">R</span></span></span></span> and then quotient out by the zero ideal, you would get a new ring <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">/</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">{</mo><mn>0</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">}</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">R/\\{0\\}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.00773em;\">R</span><span class=\"mord\">/</span><span class=\"mopen\">{</span><span class=\"mord\">0</span><span class=\"mclose\">}</span></span></span></span> which is not <em>equal</em> to <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">R</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.00773em;\">R</span></span></span></span>, even though it's canonically isomorphic to <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">R</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.00773em;\">R</span></span></span></span>.
