        "content": "<p>IDEs are usually tools that specialize in working as good as possible for one programming language out of the box. Text editors (at least the ones that are somewhat widespread today like VSCode, Emacs, Vim, Neovim, Atom) tend to specialize in extensibility and configurability and in some cases also change the way you input text drastically, most notably here the vim family and plugins for other editors that emulate vim behavior. For example my Emacs is configured to work like vim when it comes to text input, has LSP  things (which basically means auto completion, go to definition etc. for the majority of languages), specialized plugins for lots of languages like Lean, Coq, Python, Octave etc. And other goodies like Magit which is IMO by far the best git frontend there is even compared to all IDEs I've used so far.</p>\n<p>So for me Emacs is just my go to tool for everything when it comes to text editing, as soon as I have an Emacs somewhere I can do all of my work just the way I want it while if I was to use IDEs I'd have to download one for Coq, one for Python, one for C ..... and in the end I would probably only use a small subset of their features anyways so I'm not even getting more features in say Pycharm than in Emacs, simply because I don't have time to learn pycharm in and out because I write in much more than one language.</p>",
