I have a few results that I think would be good additions to mathlib's dihedral group file. Specifically, I have work related to which elements can and cannot be central in a (non-degenerate) dihedral group, since this is a result not already contained in mathlib's dihedral group file that would be commonly desired among people working with them. Now, before I officially ask for permission to make a pull request, I have uploaded the code I wrote in a standalone Lean file to my GitHub page (I am <code>Fontkodo</code> on GitHub), so that it could be reviewed, in case there is something wrong with it. The file can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/Fontkodo/dihedral-center-suggestion/blob/main/dihedral_github.lean\">here</a>. Note that while the code is contained in a standalone file, this is just for presentation purposes, because the intent is that these result would be added to the existing file. Please let me know if there is something that should be improved upon before I submit a pull request.</p>",

It's generally easiest for us to review contributions in the form of a PR since we can easily add comments and suggestions and also have our scripts check whether the code builds, etc.</p>",
