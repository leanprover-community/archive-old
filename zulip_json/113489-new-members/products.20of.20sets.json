Here is what will happen: you will try to write down mathematics, but in many cases to get from one step to the next (e.g. A and B are finite, hence A union B is finite) -- steps which a mathematician would say \"it's obvious\" -- you will need to apply a function. The thousands of lines of code which I linked to above are the community's attempt to write down every function you would ever need. So the main difficulty you will face (when you have learned the basic syntax etc) is that you don't know the names of any functions. There are four ways to deal with this problem. First, you can just ask here. Second, you can learn how to use the tactic which searches the library for the function you need. Third, you can begin to learn the logic which computer scientists use when naming these functions, and then fourth, when it is all beginning to make enough sense for this not to be a terrifying option -- you can just read the library code yourself. This is exactly how I learnt to use Lean (apart from the fact that the tactic which searches through the library didn't exist 2 years ago :-) )</p>",

        "content": "<blockquote>\n<p>Lean does have this <code>set</code> thing, but it really means \"subset\". So if you write <code>s: set alpha</code> then you are really thinking of s as a subset of alpha or a subtype of alpha or whatever you want to call it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think this is a misleading way of explaining this difference, which is biased by our set theoretic foundations background. It's some kind of accident that set theoretic foundations make no difference at all between sets that come up in real life and weird collections like <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math><semantics><mrow><mo>{</mo><mn>1</mn><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">R</mi></mrow><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><mi>sin</mi><mo>}</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\{1, \\mathbb{R}, \\sin\\}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.75em;\"></span><span class=\"strut bottom\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"mopen\">{</span><span class=\"mord mathrm\">1</span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbb\">R</span></span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mop\">sin</span><span class=\"mclose\">}</span></span></span></span>. It's because everything is a set and almost everything can be put inside a set. In type theory you can talk about such sets but you'll have to struggle a bit, which I think is fair. However you won't have to struggle to discuss sets whose elements are real numbers, or sets whose elements are functions from real numbers to real numbers. And you shouldn't think of them as subsets of anythings. They are homogeneous collections of things of the same type.</p>",
