What I've done is set up a Lean environment, and then for each level, I copy the lemma over into my editor, solve it in my local environment, and then bring the solution back into the game. Works great.</p>\n<p>My problem is on the <code>add_mul</code> level I seem to have found a solution that works fine in the game but not in my lean 3 install.</p>\n<p>In-game code:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"lemma\"><pre><span></span><code>begin\ninduction t with t ht,\nrepeat {rw mul_zero},\nrepeat {rw mul_succ},\nrefl,\nsimp,\nrw ht,\nrefl,\nend\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>In my local lean 3 install, <code>simp</code> says it can't simplify the expression any further. Is this just an artifact of the game not using the 'real' natural number support in Lean, and it's own custom class instead?</p>",
