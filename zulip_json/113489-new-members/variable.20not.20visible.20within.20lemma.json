        "content": "<p><code>constant</code> is a synonym for <code>axiom</code>. It's like doing <code>def a : \\R := sorry</code>, but Lean doesn't complain about the <code>sorry</code>.  <code>variable</code> is a mechanism to automatically add additional arguments to new definitions and theorems that reference them.  For a theorem, if the hypotheses or conclusion do not reference a <code>variable</code>, it won't be included as an additional hypothesis so won't be available in a proof.  You can force a variable to be included with an additional <code>include a</code>.  (Make sure to <code>#check</code> the type of a lemma to see what it's doing for yourself.) <a href=\"https://leanprover.github.io/reference/other_commands.html#universes-and-variables\">https://leanprover.github.io/reference/other_commands.html#universes-and-variables</a></p>",
