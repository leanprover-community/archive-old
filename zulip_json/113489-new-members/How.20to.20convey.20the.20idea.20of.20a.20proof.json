Specifically how would you go about not bogging down the reader with trivialities but provide enough detail that it's possible follow what's actually going on? </p>\n<p>E.g. I certainly don't care that you use the left introduction rule for  a disjunction or that you used the iff elimination. But it might be interesting that you show this by functional extensionality, that you use x in a universal quantifier because of a diagonalization argument or that we \"show the forward direction using continuity\".</p>\n<p>I see at least a few various options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>just not care, since it's machine-checked, we know it's correct, so we may as well not bother if others understand it</li>\n<li>break the proofs into lemmas that are somehow semi-meaningful and try to string them together in a way that convey the idea if not the details of the proof.</li>\n<li>format the proof in some clever way.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A few observations: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>pure term-level proofs are virtually unintelligible. When I see them, it tells me \"don't worry about this; it's true, but you won't learn anything studying it\".</li>\n<li>term-level proofs have no proof state visible in the IDE, so that makes them potentially more difficult to follow than tactic proofs.</li>\n<li>pure tactic chains are amazing to study the steps in an IDE but are completely meaningless without it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want me to give an <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mwe.html\">#mwe</a>, what would you like to see?</p>",

I have made mathlib PRs on basic material like Noetherian rings where I'm setting up a basic API and proving trivialities, and then I try and write super-concise proofs in term mode because these proofs are not written to be read, they're written so that we have an API. On the other hand when I'm writing teaching material for undergraduates I write super-lengthy tactic mode proofs with perhaps more lines of comments than lines of code.</p>\n<p>One rule of thumb I tend to use is that if it's mathematically trivial and you're not attempting to teach beginners how the proof works, then why not kill it in as few characters as possible, because nobody cares about the proof.</p>",
