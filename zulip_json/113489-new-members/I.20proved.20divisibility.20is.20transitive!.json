I personally cannot stand all this have have have in the weird mode promoted by TPIL in chapters 2 to 4, I think tactic mode packages it all up in a much more coherent manner. My instinct is to use big tools at all times because then I don't have to think, but I think the only time I used <code>ring</code> I could have used <code>mul_assoc</code> (perhaps my life was easier than yours because I switched the definition of divides?), and both times I used <code>norm_num</code> I could have used <code>refl</code>.</p>",
