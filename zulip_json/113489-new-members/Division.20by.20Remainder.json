It's not obvious because the result is not true for eg the real numbers, so you must be using some non-formal fact about the integers. And it's not true by definition because who are you to decide what the internal definition of the fundamental structures on the naturals are? This is a question for the person who implements &lt;, not the user. But you can trust that the implementor will have made an API for &lt;, to ensure that for all the different definitions of &lt; (and there are many), the theorem which would be true by definition if that were the definition will be in the library anyway. Asking what the definition of something like &lt; is, is not the right question. It's like asking whether lean's reals are Cauchy sequences or Dedekind cuts -- this is not a mathematical question so it shouldn't matter. The important thing is knowing that the API is there. The theorems Kyle mentions break up your goal into a sequence of natural statements which one would expect to be in the library. The knack is to figure out what to expect.</p>",
