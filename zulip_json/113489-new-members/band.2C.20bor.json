When you write computable or noncomputable definitions, they get marked with <code>noncomputable</code> as required, and programs that are computable have code generated for them. For me this is a much more concrete and practically useful notion of computability than intuitionistic mathematics. Of course when you define a program the actual definition of the program matters, and lean reflects this. But proofs are not programs and so lean is happy to identify proofs of the same proposition.</p>",
