I have no background in Type Theory and I am starting to study Category Theory (Steve Awodey's textbook). I noticed in 'Theorem Proving in Lean' there are chapters on Dependent Types and Inductive types so I will start making my way through that book, but are there any course notes or textbooks that someone can recommend?<br>\nThanks. Much appreciated</p>",
