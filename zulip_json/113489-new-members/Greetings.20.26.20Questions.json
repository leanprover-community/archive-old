After going through the introductions, I still have some questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is the status of the mathlib for LEAN4? Are we rewriting it in LEAN4, or are the former libraries simply suited for LEAN4?</li>\n<li>Things like partially ordered sets or domain theory are essential for program analysis. If there is no existing work on this in LEAN, maybe I can help.</li>\n</ol>",
