In fact, It should already be there (and if its not that is a bug). The two caveats are that preprocessor macros don't actually define usable syntax within the DSL (i.e., you can't <code>#define BRACE {</code> and then use <code>BRACE</code> in place of <code>{</code> like you could in C) and that type names need to be manually added to the syntax for disambiguation (see <a href=\"https://github.com/tydeu/lean4-alloy/blob/afa3332a21d34bc832c10f6b1a82173a2e7f3990/Alloy/C/Typedefs.lean\"><code>Typdefs.lean</code></a> for examples).</p>",
