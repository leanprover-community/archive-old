Since each <code>x</code> is an element of <code>S</code> it's of type <code>ℕ × ℕ</code>.  So is it possible to write the sum in a way that automatically deconstructs the pair, rather than having to write <code>x.1</code> and <code>x.2</code> in the summand? I've tried a few things, like <code>∑ ⟨a,b⟩ in S, ...</code>, but nothing has worked so far.</p>",
