The proofs are a bit lengthy though and may need some refactoring before going to the library.

        "content": "<p>It seemed to me that for finite-dimensional spaces, people often think of a basis as a sequence (so order matters), whereas for infinite-dimensional spaces they often think of a basis as a subset. The behaviour of dual spaces depends on whether the space is finite-dimensional or not -- you have basic observations about the dual space which work in general, but then these extra facts coming from the fact that duality is an equivalence of categories for the category of finite-dimensional spaces but this is no longer true for general spaces. So will you make the general theory for general spaces and then put extra theorems in under a finite-dimensionality hypothesis? I guess this is the way to go. Is there an <code>ordered_basis</code> for a finite-dimensional space? The dual of a finite-dimensional space with an ordered basis naturally gets an ordered basis -- usually called \"the dual basis\" but now I see it could really be called the dual ordered basis.</p>",
