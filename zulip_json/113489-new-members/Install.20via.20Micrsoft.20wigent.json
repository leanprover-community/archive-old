As a result, if you want to use different versions of mathlib, you also need different version of lean installed. The <code>elan</code> tool makes this completely transparent.<br>\nFor that reason, many of us don't want a globally installed version of lean, but rather use <code>elan</code>.</p>\n<p>Note that <code>elan</code> was inspired by <code>rustup</code>, afaik. It seems that <code>rust</code> has/had similar \"issues\".</p>",
