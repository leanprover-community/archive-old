However I'm a little unsure how to set it up. The proofs I would be doing would ideally eventually end up in ring_theory/flat.lean file. I don't think messing with that file directly in mathlib folder is a good idea. Should I copy that file to src and work from there? Or should I just create a blank file, import ring_theory.flat and whatever else and work from there?</p>",
