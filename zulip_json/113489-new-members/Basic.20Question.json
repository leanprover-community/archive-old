Directly translating a Coq file into a Lean file will simply prove that Lean is not good at being Coq. The same would work in the opposite direction. You should try to do the same math in idiomatic Coq and then in idiomatic Lean. Your definition of <code>Group</code> is nothing you would see in a Lean file</p>",
