Is there an equivalent formulation in set theory to an inductively defined proposition? If so, what would it be? What would the equivalent formulation in set theory be to a proof by cases on an inductively defined proposition? What would the justification for such a proof in set theory be? Does it follow somehow from the well ordering of the natural numbers?</p>",
