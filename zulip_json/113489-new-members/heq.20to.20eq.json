In the meantime, I've been using <code>\\Sigma x y, path x y</code> for equalities (well, I was first using Ried's method, but some universe variable considerations eventually made me move to sigma types, which you'd mentioned in the thread).  The reason this came up was that I have two different ways of representing paths, and I wanted to show that they were equivalent.  The composition of maps between these representations ends up with types that aren't definitionally equal to the original type (though they are equal) so I spent some time fruitlessly trying to get <code>heq</code> to work before thinking that it might not actually be provable.</p>\n<p>It would be kind of cool if there were a <code>heqi</code>, heterogeneous equality with indices, that could be automatically derived, perhaps given some subset of indices for a given inductive type.</p>",
