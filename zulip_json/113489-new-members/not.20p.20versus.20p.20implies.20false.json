Instead, it selectively unfolds definitions on both sides, and uses heuristics to try to luck out and find that two things are syntactically equal and hence defeq, or that they have different head constructors and cannot be defeq, with some edge cases that involve doing lots of unfolding, potentially as far as the normal form (which is the worst case scenario).</p>",

Roughly, you can repeatedly replace a well-foundness prop by an equivalent one and unroll a computation another step, so that deciding whether you can get to 0 that way is equivalent to deciding the halting problem. You can decide where to lay the blame, but if you want Lean's definitional equality to have the properties above and be transitive, then it is undecidable. </p>\n<p>Thierry Coquand and Andreas Abel went a step further, and showed that you get a failure of normalization: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08174\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08174</a>. To type theory purists, these features are pretty damning (though maybe less shocking than Agda's type in type). But most Lean users aren't bothered by it.
