For me dependent product is intuitive because it's like a \"normal\" product made of pairs <code>(a, b)</code>, just that the type of <code>b</code> may dependent on <code>a</code>. But I've seen other texts calling Pi the dependent product, so I think that's the really confusing thing :) That's why I prefer just Pi/Sigma-type</p>",
