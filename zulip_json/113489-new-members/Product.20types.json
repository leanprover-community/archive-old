In my case I want to define something where the terms are of the form: <code> ((Y : C), (f : Z ⟶ Y)) </code> Where <code> (Z : C) </code> where C is a category and the arrow is hom. How would I go about doing this (is this even possible)? <br>\nhom is defined as a function:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"n\">class</span> <span class=\"n\">has_hom</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">obj</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span> <span class=\"n\">u</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">max</span> <span class=\"n\">u</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">v</span><span class=\"bp\">+</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"o\">))</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span>\n<span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">hom</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">obj</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">obj</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span> <span class=\"n\">v</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>So I thought that I would be OK to define it as a subtype of <code>(C x Type v) </code> but this wont work as I came to realise my terms will have type <code> Z ⟶ Y</code> not Type v which is the type of <code> Z ⟶ Y</code>.</p>",
