A CAS (TI-89, Mathematica, etc.) can help you with computing derivatives symbolically and even isolating some variables given an equation. What isn't quite there yet however is eliminating variables across a set of non-linear equations (i.e. they may involve trig functions, powers greater than one, etc).</p>\n<p>Mathematica can <em>kind of</em> handle some of these cases with its <code>Reduce</code> function (which I heard uses <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylindrical_algebraic_decomposition\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylindrical_algebraic_decomposition\">cylindrical algebraic decomposition</a> under the hood). But it gets pretty slow even on examples that would come up in an undergraduate course.</p>\n<p>So for a physics class, how much calculator should be used? I think the critical piece is for the student to be able to <em>identify</em> which equations are applicable, based on the goal and the information they have.
