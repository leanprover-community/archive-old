IMHO a more suitable introductory Lean kata would be <a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/5c879811bc562909bf65c8e6/lean\">Theorem proving hello world</a>.</p>",

I guess it might not be about finding a syntax error, but that's what I thought when I read the instructions. Copying and pasting the code into VS code and solving it locally makes sense I guess, but I think it defeats the purpose of having katas on the CodeWars site, doesn't it? At that point, it seems like it would be better to migrate all of the katas into the tutorials.</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/QBcT8TNzPkV27FbH5I2xaG--/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/QBcT8TNzPkV27FbH5I2xaG--/image.png\"></a></div>",

As Jalex mentioned, you may wish to think of Codewars as a repository of Lean exercises of varying difficulty, contributed by the community, as opposed to a dedicated online tutorial. For getting up to speed with Lean as a complete beginner, I would still recommend proper tutorials and/or textbooks such as the <a href=\"https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/\">NNG</a>, <a href=\"https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/\">TPIL</a> and/or Patrick's tutorial.</p>",
