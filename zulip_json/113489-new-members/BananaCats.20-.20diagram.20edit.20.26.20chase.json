I am currently the only coder.  We would use probably github (free version) to host the code.  So far it's going to be open source and free to download.  I will put up a please donate button on a <a href=\"http://bubble.is\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://bubble.is\">bubble.is</a> project page that links to github.  So if you're into <a href=\"http://bubble.is\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://bubble.is\">bubble.is</a> (drag-n-drop website creation including database workflows), then also contact me in order to help with the project page.</p>\n<p>BananaCats is a visual diagram editor and chaser.  I can show you a working prototype so far, though it doesn't do any chasing yet.  Just editing.  The editing is rather slick and is a culmination of all my PyQt5 2D graphics skills.  It took two debugging experts (one other coder than me) to fix some of the geometry bugs.  It supports persistent undo/redo stack.  So even if you restart your machine you can undo/redo from whereever you left off in your drawing.  That already works!   It also does copy/paste with DnD and will eventually DnD to other apps (like the browser) text and images for posting questions say on MSE or a forum.  </p>\n<p>My code is very elegant and clean.  I have been coding in PyQt5 for 6 years about.  I have two professional (paid) projects under my belt.  One of which is used by engineers several times a week (it's a tool).  </p>\n<p>I worked on the design last night in my sleep (just kidding).  But when I woke up I felt refreshed and did a lot of design on cardboard (because I ran out of paper).   Anyhow, it's a very nice and simple design. <a href=\"user_uploads/3121/Q5iF1wVNRvLYKkEULdunMlQn/BananaCats_IsomorphismArrow.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"user_uploads/3121/Q5iF1wVNRvLYKkEULdunMlQn/BananaCats_IsomorphismArrow.png\">BananaCats_IsomorphismArrow.png</a> <a href=\"user_uploads/3121/ql0G1nBjvIpdar9xhtQuLMLw/Yoneda_BananaCats1.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"user_uploads/3121/ql0G1nBjvIpdar9xhtQuLMLw/Yoneda_BananaCats1.png\">Yoneda_BananaCats1.png</a> <a href=\"user_uploads/3121/Wy0zM6o2GYQHfiqBvpdRviU9/ZoomspaceScreenshot5.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"user_uploads/3121/Wy0zM6o2GYQHfiqBvpdRviU9/ZoomspaceScreenshot5.png\">ZoomspaceScreenshot5.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"user_uploads/3121/Q5iF1wVNRvLYKkEULdunMlQn/BananaCats_IsomorphismArrow.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"BananaCats_IsomorphismArrow.png\"><img src=\"user_uploads/3121/Q5iF1wVNRvLYKkEULdunMlQn/BananaCats_IsomorphismArrow.png\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"user_uploads/3121/ql0G1nBjvIpdar9xhtQuLMLw/Yoneda_BananaCats1.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Yoneda_BananaCats1.png\"><img src=\"user_uploads/3121/ql0G1nBjvIpdar9xhtQuLMLw/Yoneda_BananaCats1.png\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"user_uploads/3121/Wy0zM6o2GYQHfiqBvpdRviU9/ZoomspaceScreenshot5.png\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ZoomspaceScreenshot5.png\"><img src=\"user_uploads/3121/Wy0zM6o2GYQHfiqBvpdRviU9/ZoomspaceScreenshot5.png\"></a></div><p>Forgot to mention, BananaCats has been through 2-3 rewrites, so it's very well-written in that sense.</p>",
