It's easy to prove  ¬ ¬𝑃 intuitionistically, and it seems you need proof by contradiction to get to P.  Is there a way to convince myself that it really can't be done through intuitionistic reasoning?  Say, using a 3-valued truth table or something?</p>",

Whenever you have a special kind of partial order called a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heyting_algebra\">Heyting algebra</a>, you can interpret intuitionistic logic in it. Exercise 5.3.4 is in fact equivalent to double negation elimination, so your question reduces to finding some element <code>p</code> of some Heyting algebra such that <code>p &lt; ¬¬p</code>. Indeed the 3-element Heyting algebra {0, 1, maybe} does the job.</p>\n<p>One simple way of understanding the 3-element Heyting algebra is by checking more generally that any bounded total order <code>P</code> is a Heyting algebra. Given <code>p q : P</code>, you define logical connectives as follows: <code>p ∨ q</code> is <code>max(p,q)</code>, <code>p ∧ q</code> is <code>min(p,q)</code>, and <code>p → q</code> is <code>⊤</code> if <code>p ≤ q</code> and <code>q</code> otherwise.</p>",

When the proposition is of the form A∨B, the way to prove A∨B must either involve a proof of A or a proof of B, plus the information of which side you chose to prove. This is not true in classical logic, which has A∨¬A as an axiom, which doesn't tell you which of A or ¬A is true or how you'd prove it. The absence of this axiom, the excluded middle, is the defining feature of intuitionistic logic compared to classical logic.</p>\n</blockquote>",
