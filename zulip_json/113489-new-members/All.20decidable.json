Decidability is a core axiom in mathlib, accessed by the <code>open_locale classical</code>. But to say that everything is decidable is to say that the halting problem is not a problem. If everything is decidable, then given an arbitrary calculation (represented by a Turing machine), we can know for sure whether it halts or whether it goes on forever. But Turing proved that this is not the case for arbitrary Turing machines.</p>\n<p>Another example is decidable equality of real numbers represented as Cauchy sequences. If I give you two possibly infinite lists, where each one represents the Cauchy sequence, and I promise that both converge to some number, but possibly not the same one, can you decide whether the two sequences actually converge to the same number? It's very easy to say that whether these two sequences are different -- just keep checking each pair of terms until you hit a pair that has two different terms in it. That means that you know that the sequences are different in at least one place. However, to prove that the sequences really do converge to the same number, you would have to check an infinite number of pairs of terms. And that's not possible. You could say \"OK I'll check until some radius of convergence, and say they're equal to some epsilon difference\", which is useful(!) but not true equality.</p>",

There are two sorts of types, <code>Prop</code> and <code>Type*</code>.  Objects whose type is an inductive type in <code>Type*</code> all have some algorithm backing them, and you're able to figure out which constructor created the object in finite time (so you're able to <code>match</code> on them). Objects whose type is in <code>Prop</code> (propositions) don't have this property.</p>\n<p>The <code>decidable</code> system is a way to <code>match</code> on specific <code>Prop</code>s, and one of the main interfaces is <code>if p then ... else ...</code>.  A <code>decidable p</code> instance is essentially a function you can compute that returns a concrete boolean for whether or not <code>p</code> is true.  That way you can create things in <code>Type*</code> that depend on the truth of a proposition, which you otherwise can't do.</p>\n<p>Even though every <code>Prop</code> is definitely equal to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, there's no general algorithm to evaluate which it is (that's the incompleteness theorem), so Lean/mathlib instead has this decidability system.</p>\n<p>This is useful for when you write programs in Lean (like tactics) since then you can use <code>Prop</code>s for conditions.  It can also be nice to know mathematically whether a proposition is decidable, since it means you've reduced a problem to rote computation.</p>",
