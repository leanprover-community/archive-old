I was collaborating with an instructor remotely, and I downloaded a file they had been editing.  It used the <code>linarith</code> tactic (specifically <code>unknown identifier 'linarith'\n</code>).  However, I have been getting errors from its use, and it does not seem like I can import anything to make them go away.  Is there anything I can do?  Thank you!</p>",
