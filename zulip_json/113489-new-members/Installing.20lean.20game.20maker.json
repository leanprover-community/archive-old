For this reason, the usage guide from A) is recommended. Also, you may need to familiarize yourself with GitHub Actions, GitHub Pages and workflows, which will be required. </p>\n<p>When it comes to the deployment of the website, you should consider these two aspects: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whenever you see the line </li>\n</ul>\n<p>curl <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kha/elan/master/elan-init.sh\">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kha/elan/master/elan-init.sh</a> -sSf | sh -s -- -v -y           </p>\n<p>in the code, you must change it into </p>\n<p>curl <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh\">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh</a> -sSf | sh -s -- -v -y</p>\n<p>which is the new version.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Whenever you see the phrase “python-openssl”, you may need to change it into    “python3-openssl”.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Because the template from B) uses some snippets of code from A), you need to know that A) worked with Lean 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 versions at most, so these are not the latest now. For this reason, Marc Masdeu implemented “curl -s <a href=\"https://api.github.com/repos/leanprover-community/lean/releases/latest”\">https://api.github.com/repos/leanprover-community/lean/releases/latest”</a>    in his code, which uses the files that are needed to deploy the website from the latest version of Lean. If you are you using that latest version, then it is straightforward. However, if you are using Lean 3.45.0, for example, which is in between the latest and the Lean 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 versions, then you will need to go to the file “leanpkg.toml” and change the Lean version, which is written in the code, into the latest which is available at the time of your deployment.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
