This worked okay, except that it told me I needed to run <code>elan default stable</code> before <code>leanproject new</code>.  Unfortunately, when I actually got to the classroom and tried to run it there and load a mathlib file, it gave me a bunch of out of memory errors.  At first I thought maybe the classroom PC wasn't very powerful, but now I'm getting the same errors on my workstation:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">excessive</span> <span class=\"n\">memory</span> <span class=\"n\">consumption</span> <span class=\"n\">detected</span> <span class=\"n\">at</span> <span class=\"bp\">'</span><span class=\"n\">replace'</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">potential</span> <span class=\"n\">solution</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">increase</span> <span class=\"n\">memory</span> <span class=\"n\">consumption</span> <span class=\"n\">threshold</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>any ideas?</p>",
