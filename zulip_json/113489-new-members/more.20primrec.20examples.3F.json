Would mathlib welcome additional theorems like <code>primrec nat.fact</code> or <code>primrec_pred nat.prime</code>? The first one is a short proof that makes use of <code>prec1</code> (not used anywhere else) and I don't know how the 2nd one will turn out yet. I could look and see where other typical textbook examples could fit in to mathlib nicely.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">namespace</span> <span class=\"n\">nat</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">namespace</span> <span class=\"n\">primrec</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">-- proof that taking factorials is primitive recursive</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">theorem</span> <span class=\"n\">fact</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">primrec</span> <span class=\"n\">fact</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span>\n<span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">prec1</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">mul'.comp</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">pair</span> <span class=\"n\">right</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">succ.comp</span> <span class=\"n\">left</span><span class=\"o\">))))</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">of_eq</span> <span class=\"bp\">$</span>\n  <span class=\"bp\">Î»</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"kd\">by</span> <span class=\"n\">simp</span><span class=\"bp\">;</span> <span class=\"n\">induction</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"bp\">;</span> <span class=\"n\">simp</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">mul_comm</span><span class=\"o\">]</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">end</span> <span class=\"n\">primrec</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">end</span> <span class=\"n\">nat</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Also, I noticed some omissions  like <code>primrec.nat_pow</code> despite mathlib having <code>nat.primrec.pow</code>, while <code>add</code>, <code>sub</code> and <code>mul</code> are all synced, which to me looks like missing API..
