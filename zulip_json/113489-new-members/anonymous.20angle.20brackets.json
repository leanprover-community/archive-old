Is this notation for a sigma type (in the Tutorials it looks more like a Cartesian product)? What actually is the full syntax for these angle brackets - when exactly does one use them? But in the example (below) normal parentheses are used for what I think must be a sigma type, so I'm finding this confusing...</p>\n<p>I understand that there are differences between tactics as to how parentheses are used, and then presumably the same again outside tactics mode. So what handle do I need on this to make sense of the different uses? </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">example</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ℝ</span><span class=\"o\">}</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"bp\">∀</span> <span class=\"n\">ε</span> <span class=\"bp\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span> <span class=\"bp\">≤</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"bp\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">ε</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span>  <span class=\"n\">y</span> <span class=\"bp\">≤</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">begin</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">contrapose</span><span class=\"bp\">!</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">intro</span> <span class=\"n\">h</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">exact</span> <span class=\"o\">⟨(</span><span class=\"n\">y</span><span class=\"bp\">-</span><span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"kd\">by</span> <span class=\"n\">linarith</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"kd\">by</span> <span class=\"n\">linarith</span><span class=\"o\">⟩,</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">end</span>\n</code></pre></div>",
