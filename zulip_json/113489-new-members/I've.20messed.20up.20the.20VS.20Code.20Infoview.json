I'm using VS Code, and I guess I pressed some keyboard shortcut (although I've looked at the keyboard shortcuts and can't find anything) or something, because instead of the Infoview being formatted like:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">f</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">g</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>it's suddenly started displaying more like:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">f</span>\n   <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">g</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span>\n   <span class=\"o\">)</span>\n   <span class=\"n\">y</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>and I can see how that could be clearer sometimes to some people, but I don't want it like that.
