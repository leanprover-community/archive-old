I'm a long time vim user who has just started reading about spacemacs &amp; emacs last week in order to use lean.  I found <a href=\"https://github.com/jroesch/layer-lean\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jroesch/layer-lean\">https://github.com/jroesch/layer-lean</a>, but I couldn't get it to work.  I'm probably just making silly errors since I'm still unfamiliar with spacemacs.  I'll keep reading the documentation until I figure it out, but if anyone can speed me along that would be much appreciated.</p>",
