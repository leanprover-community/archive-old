It can be obtained just by combining <code>monoid</code> and <code>has_continuous_mul</code>.  I would just delete it. Second question: in case it is a good idea to keep <code>topological_monoid</code>just for psychological reasons, I do not know how to keep it. If I define</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">abbreviation</span> <span class=\"n\">topological_monoid</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">α</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">topological_space</span> <span class=\"n\">α</span><span class=\"o\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">monoid</span> <span class=\"n\">α</span><span class=\"o\">]</span>\n<span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">topological_semigroup</span> <span class=\"n\">α</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>then any structure, like semiring, extending <code>topological_monoid</code> breaks. Should I then make structures inherit from <code>has_continuous_mul</code> and manually define coercions to <code>topological_monoid</code>? I mean at this point it looks more logic to delete it and just use <code>has_continuous_mul</code>. If I define it like</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">class</span> <span class=\"n\">topological_monoid</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">α</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">topological_space</span> <span class=\"n\">α</span><span class=\"o\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">monoid</span> <span class=\"n\">α</span><span class=\"o\">]</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">extends</span> <span class=\"n\">topological_semigroup</span> <span class=\"n\">α</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Prop</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n\n<p>then, because of protected inheritance, all the files that try to define a <code>topological_monoid</code> with one constructor break. Is there any way to get rid of protected inheritance for this class and make it so that it can be constructed with one constructor? This is the only way I see to try to keep it.</p>",
