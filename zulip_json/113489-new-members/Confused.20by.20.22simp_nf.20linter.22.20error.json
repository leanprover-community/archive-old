I can see why this is undesirable, since the lemma is a simp lemma, so this makes it  kind of redundant. I have two problems, however:</p>\n<p>1) As far as I can tell, my PR doesn't change any files that <code>subalgebra/basic</code> depends on,  so I don't understand why the changes of the PR are triggering the error</p>\n<p>2) I'm not sure what the appropriate response is - should I just delete the lemma that's causing the problem?</p>",
