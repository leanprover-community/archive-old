And I think Lean would be a good match to implement into our Blueprint solution.<br>\nWe are implementing incentive models and since it is built on top of an open marketplace, Users can sell their mathematical equations, chemical recipes and whatnot alongside other products, tools, designs and code. Later stages will include AI that will enable it to build prototypes for us.</p>\n<p>The project aims to enable Industry 5.0, where step 1 is enabling Blueprints that covers all elements, and is reusable back to the industry.</p>\n<p>If someone is interested in joining this project, or give feedback once we have included Lean 4 in the Blueprint, feel free to reach out :)<br>\nWe also have a Discord server: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/XyxtP43xbT\">https://discord.gg/XyxtP43xbT</a></p>",
