        "content": "<p>Hello, I'm a student interested in discrete math and computer proof verification. I enjoyed natural number game but I have little experience in math, so I cannot use lean very well.  As an exercise for combinatorial proofs in lean, I made a lean3 proof for a simple binomial coefficient identity. Although the proof is complicated since it uses combinatorial arguments, I wonder if the result can be contributed to mathlib (data.nat.choose.sum). Also, should I need to learn lean4 instead of lean3? Thank you.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">theorem</span> <span class=\"n\">hockey_stick</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"n\">k</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ℕ</span><span class=\"o\">):</span>\n  <span class=\"bp\">∑</span> <span class=\"n\">i</span> <span class=\"k\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">Ico</span> <span class=\"n\">k</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"bp\">+</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"o\">),</span> <span class=\"n\">i.choose</span> <span class=\"n\">k</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"bp\">+</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"o\">)</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">choose</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">k</span><span class=\"bp\">+</span><span class=\"mi\">1</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>",
