This is a good exercise; the way to do it is perhaps to search the source code for example of proofs of decidability, then figure out how to prove the key lemma (if n&gt;=1 and k divides n then k&lt;=n) and then write the algorithm. If you don't make it efficient then that's OK, you will have trouble working out if 617 is prime, but on the other hand at least the code will work (or it might give you a time-out the moment the numbers get too large to do on your fingers :-) )</p>",
