Just introducing myself.</p>\n<p>I have pretty much 0 experience with online forums of any sort, but I have been programming in Lean for some time now. My latest achievement is a proof of the soundness of classical predicate logic. Then, since some questions about the language have piled up with time, I decided to start being more sociable.</p>\n<p>I am also a computer science undergraduate student at PUC Rio, studying type theory and logic under Professor Edward Hermann Haeusler.</p>\n<p>So anyway, I suppose that 's it, what should I do next?</p>",
