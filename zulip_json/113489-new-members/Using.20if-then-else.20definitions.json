If I've defined a function <code>ℕ → ℕ</code> by making use of the if-then-else construct, how do I go about proving anything about that function? For example, given:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"kn\">definition</span> <span class=\"n\">nat_max</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">m</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"bp\">ℕ</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">m</span> <span class=\"bp\">&lt;</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"k\">then</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"k\">else</span> <span class=\"n\">m</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>How do I prove something like</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"kn\">lemma</span> <span class=\"n\">max_right</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">m</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"bp\">ℕ</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">m</span> <span class=\"bp\">&lt;</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">nat_max</span> <span class=\"n\">m</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">sorry</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>? This seems as though it should be trivial, but I'm struggling. <code>unfold nat_max, by_cases (m &lt; n)</code>gives me two cases, one of which is an easy contradiction. The other then looks like:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"n\">m</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"bp\">ℕ</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n<span class=\"n\">h</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">m</span> <span class=\"bp\">&lt;</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span>\n<span class=\"err\">⊢</span> <span class=\"n\">m</span> <span class=\"bp\">&lt;</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"bp\">@</span><span class=\"n\">ite</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">m</span> <span class=\"bp\">&lt;</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">nat</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"n\">decidable_lt</span> <span class=\"n\">m</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"bp\">ℕ</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"n\">m</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>and at that point I'm stuck.</p>",
