Each leaf of the case tree corresponds to a single row of the truth table, so if you can prove all of them (by simplification, e.g. using rewrites like <code>(false -&gt; true) = true</code>), then that is just saying that all rows of the truth table come out true, and you get a proof as a result.</p>",

The described method obviously doesn't work because it explicitly requires LEM (the principle <code>p = true \\/ p = false</code> is just LEM stated slightly differently), and truth table proving is intrinsically connected to the idea that every proposition has one of a finite number of truth values, which is false in intuitionistic logic</p>",
