One thing I'd like to do is make this an instance of the functor class, however for this it's necessary to prove that map preserves the size of an array. I decided to go the route of creating my own \"map\" for arrays that generated this proof, but to do that I need to pattern match on arrays. Is there any way to do this?</p>",
