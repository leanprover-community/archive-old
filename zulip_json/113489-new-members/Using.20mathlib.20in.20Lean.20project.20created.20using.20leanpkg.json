I've also tried <code>import .._target.deps.mathlib.src.data.real.cau_seq</code>, i.e. using relative paths as described in <a href=\"https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/interacting_with_lean.html#importing-files\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/interacting_with_lean.html#importing-files\">6.1.
