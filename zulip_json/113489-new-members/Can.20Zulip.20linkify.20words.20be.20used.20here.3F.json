If linkify words can be used here, it would be nice for those new to Lean to see such words linkified when used, e.g. <a href=\"#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/getting.20started.20questions/near/245627322\">here</a> Kevin writes</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Did you install the tutorial using <code>leanproject</code>?
