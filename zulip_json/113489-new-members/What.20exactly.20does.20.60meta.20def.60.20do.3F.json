But when we write e.g. a <code>begin ... end</code> block, then Lean parses, compiles <em>and</em> executes the code within the <code>begin ... end</code> block during type checking, just as if e.g. in C++ we would have actually built and run the code. So in a sense, Lean contains a \"compiler and execution environment within a type checker\". After running this code, each <code>begin ... end</code> block produces a non-meta term, which is then type checked as a non-meta term. If it fails this type check, the <code>begin ... end</code> block produces an error.</p>\n<p>Regarding tactic writing (), this means the following:<br>\nWe can essentially think of any <code>begin ... end</code> block as contain code that we will actually compile and run, just like any other language like C++, except this compilation and running will happen automatically, meaning you never have to press the \"Run\" button in your IDE. Moreover, we are not allowed to use terms within the <code>begin ... end</code> blocks that don't have the <code>meta</code> keyword, and conversely, we're only allowed to use terms with the <code>meta</code> keyword within <code>begin ... end</code> blocks. In short, <code>meta</code> terms are treated as objects that one can actually run, whereas non-<code>meta</code> terms are only type checked.</p>\n<p>However, unlike C++, the Lean \"meta-language\" is a functional language, and so should be treated like e.g. Haskell. </p>\n<p>To summarize, Lean essentially consists of \"two separate languages\", and an interface between them: the Lean \"proof-language\" consists of all terms without the <code>meta</code> keyword, and the Lean \"meta-language\" consists of those with the <code>meta</code> keyword. The meta-language behaves like a normal functional language. The proof-language has a special type system designed along the lines of the Curry-Howard isomorphism and is only type-checked but never executed. The interface between the proof- and meta-language are the tactic blocks <code>begin ... end</code> and <code>by</code>, which tell the meta-language compiler to compile and execute the contents of the block as source code in the meta-language, and interpreting the output as source code of the proof-language. It then replaces the <code>begin ... end</code> block with this source code, and leaves it to the proof-language type checker to type check it as code in the proof-language.</p>\n<p><strong>Is this a correct view of how Lean works internally? Will it lead me astray if I would write tactics?</strong> Even if it wouldn't lead me astray, I'd still be interested in where I'm wrong on the details.</p>",

Then, you as a mathematician know that you should not extend the Curry-Howard isomorphism to the types of <code>meta</code> definitions since otherwise you would believe in contradictions.</p>\n<p>Going the other way, every <code>meta</code> definition can use all the (computable) non-<code>meta</code> definitions it wants.</p>",

Keep an eye out for some links soon.</p>\n<p>You have most of it right. Let's set some terminology: meta-Lean is \"Lean with the <code>meta</code> keyword.\" In some sense, all the <code>meta</code> keyword does is disable termination checking. Meta-Lean is an extension of non-meta Lean, in that any non-meta declaration can also be used in meta declarations. Meta-Lean is trivially unsound (see <code>meta def t : false := t</code>) so it's not interesting for writing proofs. </p>\n<p>But you can evaluate meta declarations using <code>#eval</code>. This evaluation happens in the VM, which is not trusted code. So another reading of <code>meta</code> is \"for evaluation only,\" non-meta is \"for evaluation and proof.\"</p>\n<p>The VM overrides certain declarations during evaluation. For instance, nats are not represented as the familiar inductive type in the VM. Importantly, a lot of Lean internals that are exposed as meta constants or defs in Lean (<code>expr</code>, <code>env</code>, all the atomic tactics) are overridden. This is confusing, because it's what \"meta\" should mean. In practice most (but not all) of the reflected Lean stuff has the <code>meta</code> keyword, and some reflected Lean stuff doesn't strictly need to be <code>meta</code>.</p>\n<p>The code that appears between <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> is a meta-Lean expression. It has type <code>tactic unit</code>, effectively a function <code>tactic_state -&gt; tactic_state</code>. (<code>tactic_state</code> is a meta constant in Lean, a C++ data structure in the VM.) <code>begin..end</code> and <code>by</code> are hooks that will construct the <code>tactic_state</code> at the start point, evaluate your tactic script on this tactic state, and deal with the output. Part of the tactic state is a (partially) constructed Lean expression. When this term is fully constructed, it's sent to the kernel to check. Indeed, this term is a result of executing your metaprogram, it doesn't contain the metaprogram you wrote itself. (But it's not necessarily non-meta. You can write a tactic script to produce a meta expr. <code>meta example : expr := by exact expr.var 0</code>) The kernel will never see the script between <code>begin..end</code>, just its output.</p>",

        "content": "<p>(I'm writing this because I have some interest in internals, and I would appreciate being corrected.)</p>\n<p>The stuff about a VM is purely optimization.  Since <code>meta</code> definitions don't take part in mathematical truth, it's OK to evaluate such code in a faster way, even if the VM might be less trusted to be correct.  (Though what Rob was saying about some <code>meta</code> definitions being replaced by C++ implementations might be another reason: it helps keep the Lean kernel smaller and easier to trust if it doesn't also have to be able to reduce general <code>meta</code> terms too?)</p>\n<p>I was looking through some of how the parser works, and <code>begin ... end</code> blocks are (seemingly) parsed into a special term (an external action) that contains a term that should be a <code>tactic unit</code>.  I presume the way it then works is that when the Lean compiler sends parsed definitions to the kernel, these terms, including the external actions, are type checked and, once the context around the external action is figured out as much as can be, the kernel asks the outer-layer compiler to fill in the hole.  In this particular case, this involves the compiler evaluating the <code>tactic unit</code> with respect to the context, producing a term -- some amount of type checking needs to have been done by this point so the goal window has anything to say, so to speak.</p>\n<p>I'm hazy about lots of specifics here, but one conceptual model that seems OK is that you can think of most of the C++ code, the <code>meta</code> definitions, and the non-<code>meta</code> definitions as being the outer-layer compiler, and a subset of the C++ code and the non-<code>meta</code> definitions are the Lean kernel and math.  The overlap is that it's as if each non-<code>meta</code> definition also creates a companion <code>meta</code> definition.  The outer layer is responsible for interfacing with the real world and directs the Lean kernel, and there is some protocol (for example, <code>begin ... end</code> blocks) for the Lean kernel to ask the outer layer for more information during its type checking process.</p>\n<p>I couldn't find the process by which the outer layer checks the types of its meta definitions.  I'm guessing there is some provision in the Lean kernel for this.</p>\n<p>It seems the way disabling termination checking works is (1) that meta definitions are allowed to refer to the function being defined and (2) that the equation compiler is able to construct terms making use of this, whereas non-<code>meta</code> definitions cannot do so and instead need to resolve into the actual recursors for the given inductive types.  For example, compare these two definitions of factorial:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">def</span> <span class=\"n\">f</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span

        "content": "<p>(As if there weren't enough explanations on the thread already:) There are two important and orthogonal properties that a lean term can have. (1) It can participate in the standard consistent CIC dependent type theory (as e.g described in <a href=\"https://github.com/digama0/lean-type-theory/releases/tag/v1.0\">my thesis</a>), and (2) it can be evaluable by the lean virtual machine. These properties are negatively marked: a term lacking property (1) is called <code>meta</code>, and a term lacking property (2) is called <code>noncomputable</code>, and you are required to put these markings as appropriate on all definitions.</p>\n<p>In particular, all four combinations of the two properties are possible: a <code>meta def</code> has (2), a <code>def</code> has (1) and (2), a <code>noncomputable def</code> has (1), and a <code>noncomputable meta def</code> has neither (this last class is basically useless).</p>\n<p>All definitions go through lean's elaborator, which is responsible for inferring all the missing arguments. (This may involve running tactics but we'll get back to that.) From there definitions with (1) go to the small trusted kernel to be re-typechecked, and they also end up in the proof output format, while definitions with (2) go to the compiler to be turned into VM bytecode. A definition with both (1) and (2) gets both kernel typechecked and compiled to VM bytecode.</p>\n<p>Because tactics are meant to be run, they must have property (2), but they need not have property (1). In particular, since most of the core primitives are <code>meta</code>, including the type <code>tactic</code> itself, tactics are always <code>meta</code> meaning they lack property (1). But that doesn't mean that you can't use non-<code>meta</code> definitions, as long as they are computable. A good example of a library with both (1) and (2) is <code>list A</code> and the functions manipulating it. This is used in both proofs (for example, to define finiteness) as well as in computations (running functions to filter <code>list</code>s of hypotheses and the like).</p>\n<p>When the lean elaborator hits a <code>begin ... end</code> block, it elaborates the contents of the block in a special parser mode into a tactic, typechecks it as a <code>tactic unit</code> (not using the kernel, just the elaborator's basic haskell-like typechecker), compiles it to bytecode on the spot (so it needs to be computable, i.e. property (2)), and then runs it, whereupon the tactic will fill in the hole at the location of the <code>begin ... end</code> with a term (which may be non-meta, and is required to be if the definition itself is non-meta).</p>",
