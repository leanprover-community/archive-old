I'm going to post my question again with some details addressing questions on my first post. I'm using Lean mainly to learn formal logic and abstract math for the first time, so I don't want to use tactics because tactics make it hard to see what's actually happening under the hood. Below is MWE example of the problem I'm having. I think there is some issue with the types of my variables, but I can't get anything with Cartesian products to work:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"
