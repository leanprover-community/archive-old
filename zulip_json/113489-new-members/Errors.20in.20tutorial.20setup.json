When I try to run the \"lean\" command on anything inside the directory I get (which has a leanpkg.path to point lean to the vendored mathlib), it runs for a few minutes, consumes a few CPUs, and writes a continuous stream of errors like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>tutorials/_target/deps/mathlib/src/tactic/interactive_expr.lean:265:0: error: unknown identifier 'tc.stateless'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Am I doing something obviously wrong here?</p>",
