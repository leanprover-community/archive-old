        "content": "<p>Hi everyone,<br>\nI find myself interested in learning programming with lean 4. Are there any good resources to get started?<br>\nSpecifically this is not a question about learning syntax but beyond that, how do you go about writing programs.</p>\n<p>About me:<br>\nMy background is in topology and category theory. Whenever I want to learn programming it goes like this: I start out with a python exercise, somehow find myself in Haskell a little while later, then I'm reading about idris, and then before long I'm reading about categorical logic... this is the basic trajectory every time.<br>\nlast year I had a lot of fun going through lean 3 tutorials for theorem proving. Not using tactics, mind you, just writing proof terms. Really cool.</p>\n<p>More recently I have been contributing to a python program again: 'manim'. This is a mathematical animation library used to make maths lecture videos. The videos it can make are great, but the language (python) is infuriating. I have been trying to add typing hints to it and clean up all the errors found by static type checkers ... but ... sigh.</p>\n<p>I have gone through the MIT lectures on \"Programming with categories\". This is basically an explanation of how Haskell fits in with the simply typed lambda calculus and Cartesian closed categories. While fun lectures, they do not teach how to go about structuring a program, how to even start. When I go look at an open source Haskell project in the wild however, I usually find the code impenetrable. There are just too many programming constructs and conventions that I have not learned, not to mention the fact that programmers have their own vocabulary and jargon that partially overlaps with category theory jargon, but with different meanings for the same phrases. </p>\n<p>All that is to say, I would love it if there were programming tutorials / exercises / cookbooks based on Lean 4. Where do I start?</p>",

Whilst lean 4 is definitely nowhere nearly as polished on the UX side as lean 3, it is actually quite competent at being a programming language.

But on the other hand the various syntactical tricks they've pulled makes writing monadic code (something you almost certainly need for anything non-trivial) very nice.</p>\n<p>In fact, in a lot of ways it's quite a lot nicer than Haskell.</p>\n<p>As a programming language it has a quite unique feel to it, since you can't debug anything, really, but you also tend to evaluate during type-checking time. So, in a sense, it almost feels like a dynamic language in a lot of ways.</p>\n<p>If your goal is writing programs, lean 4 is actually a fine choice. Just don't expect you'll be writing many proofs. The tactics and library story is far behind what lean 3 + matlib can offer.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you want to write some kind of program (especially hacking the lean 4 compiler itself), it's really good. You can still enforce some invariants at the type level if you are so inclined.</p>\n<p>But the kinds of invariants you are more likely to express right now in lean 4 are kinds of things you want to carry around in your program. Perhaps, you'd like to prove that you are never going to access an array out-of-bounds. And then you can use that fact to make very efficient code. Stuff like that.</p>",
