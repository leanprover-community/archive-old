My research is in Homotopy Type Theory and I spend much of my time formalising in Agda. This semester I want to have a couple of hands-on 'introduction to computer formalisation' sessions for the mathematics students at the university. I want to make it as useful and as simple as possible, without having to teach them much type theory. Thus I thought that tactics based formalisation in Lean would be the best alternative. So I have jumped on here because I frequently have questions as I am trying to learn it <span aria-label=\"smiling face\" class=\"emoji emoji-263a\" role=\"img\" title=\"smiling face\">:smiling_face:</span></p>",
