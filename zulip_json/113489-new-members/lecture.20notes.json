        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"271218\">@Thorsten Altenkirch</span>, Gabriel Ebner did most of the Sphinx customization for the tutorials, and it works great. As has been suggested, one option is to copy an existing tutorial (<em>Mathematics in Lean</em> is the most recent) and modify it. If you like to have the feeling of knowing what is going on under the hood, another option is to do a standard Sphinx setup, compare it to an existing tutorial, and then modify the Sphinx setup to match. IIRC, the key additions are these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gabriel wrote <code>lean_sphinx.py</code> to make it possible to test all the Lean snippets with <code>make leantest</code>.</li>\n<li>He modified <code>make.bat</code> to add a procedure to install python and pygments. He also changed the <code>SPHINXBUILD = sphinx-build</code> to <code>SPHINXBUILD = python -msphinx</code>. (At one point I thought I figured out why, but now I don't remember.)</li>\n<li>You have to go through the <code>conf.py</code> file and get the settings right. Again, you can do this by comparing line-by-line to e.g. the one in <em>Mathematics in Lean</em>. For example, we use <code>xelatex</code> and the <code>unixode.sty</code> package to handle unicode, and I added some things to the latex preamble. I also tinkered with the fonts and font sizes.</li>\n<li>We use the <code>alabaster</code> Sphinx theme, but I made a small modification to the sidebar, in <code>source/_templates</code>. It is just cosmetic.</li>\n<li>Gabriel wrote a <code>deploy.sh</code> script to deploy the html. The one in <em>Mathematics in Lean</em> is more complicated than the others, since it also sets up the user version of the repository with copies of all the exercises, so that when they open up an exercise, they can modify it and save it in a local folder. For example, for<code>mathematics_in_lean</code>, the source repository is <code>mathematics_in_lean_source</code>, and we deploy to <code>mathematics_in_lean</code> for both the <code>github.io</code> pages and the user version of the repository. (The arrangement is currently imperfect: if users pull a new version of the repository, it overwrites any work they have done.)</li>\n<li>We make the source repository a Lean project (see the <code>leanproject</code> documentation) and install mathlib locally. That way, we can control the versions of Lean and mathlib that users have when they install it on their machine, and we can test the snippets against that version.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Use <code>make html</code> to build / test the html, <code>make latexpdf</code> to build / test the latex, and <code>make leantest</code> to test all the snippets. You can deploy it anywhere: <code>deploy foo bar</code> puts it at <code>foo.github.io/bar</code> (assuming you have set that repository to show pages on <code>github.io</code>. The version for <code>mathematics_in_lean</code> also set <code>github/foo/bar</code> to be the user template. (For example, in <code>mathematics_in_lean</code>, the source repository is <code>mathematics_in_lean_source</code>, and we deploy to <code>mathematics_in_lean</code>) I often deploy pages to a separate test repository (like <code>avigad/mathematics_in_lean</code>) just to check them online and make sure everything looks o.k. before deploying again to the official one (<code>leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean</code>).</p>\n<p>Like I said, the system works great. You have to get used to restructured text conventions, but writing, testing, and deploying goes very smoothly.</p>\n<p>We can imagine some improvements. For <code>mathematics_in_lean</code>, it would be nice to have longer examples stored in the local repository (and in a github repository for the online version) so that we can quote from them in the text and users can click to jump to the corresponding place in a longer file. So we may be playing around with that over the next few months. But for short, self-contained examples, the snippets work great. You can limit what is displayed in the textbook (for example, to suppress repeated import statements and definitions) by putting them between <code>-- BEGIN</code> and <code>-- END</code> comments, as you'll see frequently done in our tutorials.</p>\n<p>One more thing: when users are running VS Code with Lean, they can type <code>Ctrl-Shift P</code> (or <code>Cmd-Shift P</code> on a Mac, I think) to get the menu and then type <code>Lean: Open Documentation View</code>, and that gives them a list of tutorials they can run in the browser. If you want to add yours to the list, you have to add it to the Lean VS Code interface: <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/blob/master/src/docview.ts#L108-L114\">https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean/blob/master/src/docview.ts#L108-L114</a>. I think <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110043\">@Gabriel Ebner</span> doesn't mind merging a pull request, and I am sure Lean users will be happy to have another tutorial to play with.</p>",
