I'm trying to write an equality of real numbers but the terms for the left hand side are causing it to be interpreted as a natural number. How do I coerce it? I'm using division for it, is there some kind of \"real division\" I should be using instead?</p>",

You'll then learn quickly that people usually give very efficient answers on this forum. See <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mwe.html\">#mwe</a> (that's a link) for more details on this technique.</p>",
