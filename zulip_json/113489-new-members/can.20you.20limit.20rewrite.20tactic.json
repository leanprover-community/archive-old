I'm Andrew Parr and I'm currently studying for an MSc in Mathematics at the Open University part time and I'm also trying to learn lean.</p>\n<p>I'm been looking at the excellent formalising-mathemtics by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110038\">@Kevin Buzzard</span>  but am currently stuck on proving the lemma inv_inv in tatic mode (found in week_2\\Part_A_groups.lean).</p>\n<p>After struggling for a while to prove this in tactic mode I found I could prove it in calc mode. I then tried to convert this proof to tactic mode but fail because the rewrite tactic is rewriting both of the <code>a</code> terms.
