To me <code>simp</code> is the best thing since sliced bread, Dafny tries to close every induction-ish goal but doesn't give me much control over the process but in Lean I can write the outline of the induction proof, throw <code>simp</code> at it and move on while I retain fine-grained control!</p>",
