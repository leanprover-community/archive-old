I opened my old project in a newly installed lean and found out, that the automaticly generated names in tactic mode are super weird-looking -&gt; <code> ᾰ </code> ,   <code>ᾰ _1 </code> etc. (instead of <code>a</code>, <code>a_1</code> which were generated before). I dont even know, how to actually write such characters and it also unfortunately messes up my  (quite a long) code. Is there some way how to change that? Thanks, Jachym</p>",
