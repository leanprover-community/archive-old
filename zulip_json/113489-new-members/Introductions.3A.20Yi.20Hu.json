        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"485551\">@Yi Hu</span> ! I had some email exchange with Lafforgue about this idea -- did he forward it to you? I may as well summarize here anyway. As Heather said we are decent in commutative algebra but right now are weak in the more global aspects of algebraic geometry (we only just got fiber products of schemes for example, and still don't have projective or proper schemes, although people are working on them). These things will happen in time, but it's difficult to know how long they'll take because we rely on teams of volunteers who need to know both the mathematics and how to write the code.</p>\n<p>The way big formalisation projects seem to work (these observations are based on empirical experience here) are that to make a project happen you need</p>\n<p>*) either a document containing all details of the proof including ones that mathematicians don't normally write down, or constant access to someone (eg you) who knows all these details and who is available to help out;</p>\n<p>*) One or more \"formalisation leaders\" who take on the task of breaking down the project into reasonable steps, setting milestones etc and driving the project followers (this can take up a <em>lot</em> of time, it might end up being the only research project they work on, and of course this can take implications on someone's career path)</p>\n<p>*) A team of people who are prepared to help out because they believe in the project.</p>\n<p>With the resolution paper my personal opinion is that it's a bit too early to get started, because the human community has not really had time to start making an informed decision about whether the proof is ok. With the Scholze project this also wasn't the case in some sense but it was a much smaller manuscript and the technical point which nobody had checked could be isolated and was only a few pages and in some sense elementary. The other thing i worry about is finding a formalisation leader for the project. Right now because this area is so new it might be difficult to find an appropriate person, especially because the human community haven't really had time to react to the preprint. Can you give some kind of estimate as to how much of the paper is \"essentially comprehensible to an MSc student once they have understood the notation\"?</p>",

The key sections are Sections 4 - 9.</p>\n<p>We finesse Grassmanianns and blowups. Instead, we can replace a Grassmannian by the Plucker projective space together with Plucker equations (or just affine charts of the above). Instead of using general blowup (which requires Proj), we can use the most simple ones: (locally) blowing up an affine space V along a co-dimension two coordinate subspace (x=y=0). This can be realized as V \\times P^1 and a single equation xv-yu=0. For closed subscheme X of V (that is not contained in the center (x=y=0)) with a family of polynomial equations,  the induced blowup on X can be described by proper transforms of  the above family of polynomial equations.</p>\n<p>The above form the core of the proofs of my paper. It is (complicated, a lot of notations) but very elementary in essence.</p>",
