I am going through the Natural number game <a href=\"https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/\">https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/</a>. One of the levels is to construct an element of (P -&gt; Q) -&gt; ((Q -&gt; empty) -&gt; (P -&gt; empty)). As a mathematician, I think of the set P -&gt; empty as being empty. Therefore, the set (P -&gt; Q) -&gt; ((Q -&gt; empty) -&gt; (P -&gt; empty)) should be empty. And yet we seem to successfully construct an element of it. What is going on here?</p>",
