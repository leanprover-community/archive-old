Also, if I try to do ordered ring with {1,2,3} and it doesn't go through, then I have to think harder about ordered rings and if there is a nontrivial finite example and then construct that.  I say <code>nontrivial</code> in the Lean technical sense because it makes it a little more challenging.   I.e. there are probably trivial instances of ordered ring that are provable with less effort, but not in a way that generalizes. I feel like {0,1,2} proofs are more likely to generalize to the ℕ case, so I get more intuition from doing them than from doing proofs for trivial sets.</p>\n<p>I'm trying to firm up my mathematical education by going through these kinds of exercises.  I am building up a vocabulary I haven't yet acquired.  I don't know enough to easily see that  {1,2,3} isn't an ordered ring.  Lean is perfect in that regard because every assumption about an object can be clearly stated and clearly verified.  There is no hand-waving.  I see it as a mental prosthetic which will help me acquire and learn how to work with concepts that were previously too daunting or mysterious to approach, like the construction of the reals or the Lebesgue integral.</p>",

Most of the time I am cargo culting.  I know real mathematicians with larger and proper mathematical training when I see them.  I know I don't have that training.  But I do have a little bit of common sense and I know that I've learned something over the last several weeks by trying to get things to go in Lean, if only that you don't like putting names on things when you don't have to and you like to organize around measurable spaces but you don't like to organize around sigma algebras.  There is no chance, at my age, in my career, with my practical options, that I will have the time or resources to go back to school and get proper training.  Not that any mathematician would want me.  At one point I wanted to pick up the family and go study with Jordan Stoyanov, an itinerant mathematician retired from Newcastle.  My wife threw a fit.  She likes a big house.  So I do what I can.  Lean and Zulip are a gift from God in that respect.  To some extent things like EdX and Coursera can be helpful, and I've been there, but for some reason, the MOOC world is full of interesting exotic topics but a solid and thorough curriculum in core mathematics is just not there.  So I do what I can, and what comes easily.  Printing a graph of Lean definitions and then trying to find concrete instances that satisfy each definition is something that fits my skill set and temperament.  It's not math maybe, but I find it satisfying.  It's what I can do.  It may or not be fruitful for me individually.  It won't matter to anybody else if it is or isn't.  I'm not trying to cure cancer here, just scratch my own personal itch.</p>",
