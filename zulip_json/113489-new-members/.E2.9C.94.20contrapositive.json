The converse,<br>\nthat <code>(¬ Q → ¬ P) → (P → Q)</code> is certainly true, but trying to prove<br>\nit using what we've learnt so far is impossible (because it is not provable in<br>\nconstructive logic). </p>\n<p>My question is this, since I proved <a href=\"https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/natural_number_game/blob/master/src/game/world6/level8.lean\">https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/natural_number_game/blob/master/src/game/world6/level8.lean</a> here <code>lemma contrapositive (P Q : Prop) : (P → Q) → (¬ Q → ¬ P) </code> can I not just apply <code>contrapositive (¬ Q) (¬ P)</code> to get <code>(¬ Q → ¬ P) → (P → Q)</code>?</p>",
