E.g., vscode shows a menu in the upper right as slightly off the screen, so I need to make sure to manually move such \"X11 overlays\" so they are fully visible on screen.  But overall this approach to Linux graphical applications fits into how CoCalc already works, and adds an enormous amount of new functionality.</p>",
