I wanted to ask, whether it has some actual value, can be used somewhere or something? I kind of suppose its nothing complicated (maybe it was even done before?), but still. I also would be very thankful- since i am fairly bad with lean and not at all sure with what i created- if someone would be up for scanning through the code to give me some feedback. Its approximately 800 lines long.  Cheers, Jachym</p>",
