I followed the instructions on my personal laptop, and it all worked fine.  Then I tried it on my office computer, and it works less well.  It's not a complete failure, but as good as.  To test, I'm in mathematics_in_lean going through welcome.lean.  When I \"try it\", it prints Hello World and 2+ 2 : N,  f: N -&gt; N for the checking in the next one. Then I get to the third grey box with a \"try it\" option. It has to import something.  First it says it is loading for a rather long time. Then after a few minutes it gives me lots of error messages like this: </p>\n<p>Error updating: excessive memory consumption detected at 'expression traversal' (potential solution: increase memory consumption threshold).</p>\n<p>Any help much appreciated. Mark</p>",
