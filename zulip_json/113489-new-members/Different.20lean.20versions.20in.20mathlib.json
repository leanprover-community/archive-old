I am quite new to Lean, only started playing around with it the past month or so (worked my way through the tutorial, some small theorems like Cauchy in R iff convergent, and am now working my way through Mathematics in Lean). </p>\n<p>I have a vague eventual goal of being able to add something to the maths library, but my maths is quite rusty so for the moment I plan to simply use this to work through some old textbooks (so I can check I am e.g. getting the exercises correct). This is just something fun for me to do on the side, but I am aware that formalising things can take quite a while so my \"for the moment\" goal may stick around for probably months at least. </p>\n<p>My question therefore is to do with how the different lean versions affect my ability to continue with a long-term project like this. Will mathlib switch over to lean 4 at some point, then to lean 5, 6, etc? If so, how drastic are the changes likely to be between the versions - should it still be backwards compatible enough that I can lift code from one version and run it in another? </p>\n<p>More to the point, can the maths library lift things from one version to run in another? I'd think surely so - you wouldn't all be working on a project that could become obsolete in a matter of years - but maybe there is instead some plan to do a mass rewriting of the library every few years to port it over!</p>",

I suppose that I have my lean 3 and mathlib copy on my computer, so I can keep using that even after the migration until I finish a particular project </p>\n<p>Are the changes always like this? Just feels like it could be increasingly unwieldy the bigger the library gets. </p>\n<p>How are the changes an improvement, out of curiosity?</p>",
