        "content": "<p>Hello, </p>\n<p>I am working on understanding derivatives in Lean, and am trying to use the work done on proving the divergence theorem for Bochner integrals to show the relationship between the derivative and integral form of the continuity equation. To give some background, I am a senior undergrad chemical engineer working on a project to formalize scientific equations.</p>\n<p>The pdf I've attached is an outline of what I'm trying to write. I guess what I still don't fully understand in Lean is exactly how to write out a function, especially since I know functions from a scientific background rather than a general math background. For instance, in my outline, I'm unsure how exactly I should write density and velocity in Lean. I also attached the code I've started on, but it's not correct, I just tried to get everything written down so I could have a starting point. I ran into problems of Lean throwing errors of not having different spaces defined, but even if I try to define them Lean doesn't use them. Or I run into the problem of getting the types to match up, which makes me think I am understanding how to apply the types for my functions wrong. I really appreciate any help you can give!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/JRiFciEM1d_3MvsEUhvX647I/ContinuityFromDivergence.pdf\">ContinuityFromDivergence.pdf</a></p>\n<p>I tried to comment on my thought process. My first question is more about Types. I still have trouble understanding exactly how they translate from my perception of Math. I just wanted to include my code for clarity of what I'm trying to do.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"c1\">--The continuity equation for mass over a control volume</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">data.real.basic</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">analysis.calculus.fderiv</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">analysis.calculus.deriv</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">measure_theory.integral.interval_integral</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">open_locale</span> <span class=\"n\">big_operators</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"kn\">local</span> <span class=\"kd\">notation</span> <span class=\"bp\">`</span><span class=\"n\">ℝ</span><span class=\"bp\">³`</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">fin</span> <span class=\"mi\">3</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">ℝ</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">local</span> <span class=\"kd\">notation</span> <span class=\"bp\">`</span><span class=\"n\">ℝ</span><span class=\"bp\">²</span> <span class=\"bp\">`</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">fin</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">ℝ</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">theorem</span> <span class=\"n\">some_name</span>\n<span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">μ</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">measure_theory.measure</span> <span class=\"n\">ℝ</span><span class=\"bp\">³</span> <span class=\"bp\">.</span> <span class=\"n\">measure_theory.volume_tac</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n<span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">M</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ℝ</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">ℝ</span><span class=\"bp\">³</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">ρ</span> <span class=\"n\">v</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ℝ</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">ℝ</span><span class=\"bp\">³</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">ℝ</span><span class=\"bp\">³</span> <span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\">-- Mass, density</span>\n<span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ℝ</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n<span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">V1</span> <span class=\"n\">V2</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">ℝ</span><span class=\"bp\">³</span><span class=\"o\">))</span>  <span class=\"c1\">-- consider a finite volume V which is defined on ℝ³ FOr Lean we define V as V2 - V1</span>\n<span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">V</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ℝ</span><span class=\"bp\">³</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">hV</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">V1</span> <span class=\"bp\">≤</span> <span class=\"n\">V2</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">F</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">ℝ</span><span class=\"bp\">³</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">ℝ</span><span class=\"bp\">³</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\">-- flux of our fluid</span>\n<span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">F'</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">ℝ</span><span class=\"bp\">³</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">ℝ</span><span class=\"bp\">³</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span><span class=\"n\">L</span><span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">ℝ</span><span class=\"o\">]</span> <span class=\"n\">ℝ</span><span class=\"bp\">³</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\">-- a partial derivatvie of our vector</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">--define how our flux term F relates to density and velocity</span>\n<span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">hF</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">F</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">ρ</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"bp\">•</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">v</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"o\">))</span> <span class=\"c1\">--I feel like I'm using the wrong operator here.
