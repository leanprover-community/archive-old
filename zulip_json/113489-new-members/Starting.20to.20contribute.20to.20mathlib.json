        "content": "<p>I've been doing Lean tutorials in my spare time for the past couple of weeks. I’d like to start taking steps to contribute to mathlib, and I’ll probably have about 1 hour per day to spare for this for now. </p>\n<p>Firstly, my understanding is that the Lean community is interested in formalizing mathematics, and not so interested in formalizing theoretical computer science. Is my impression correct? (though I’ve also seen computability theory as a topic mathlib). </p>\n<p>Regarding math, there are topics that I’m interested in and topics I’m not that interested in: I’m interested in both applied and pure math, but within pure math I’m mostly interested in topics that are foundational for parts of computer science, machine learning, and parts of physics. Also, if it’s more “fundamental”, I’ll be more motivated to work on it. But it doesn’t have to be exotic, and in fact I’d prefer to do quite basic things in Lean.</p>\n<p>Looking at the <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad_todo.html\">Missing undergraduate mathematics in mathlib</a> page, some topics that I’d broadly be interested in working on within Mathlib are:<br>\nLinear algebra<br>\nTopology<br>\nMeasure theory<br>\nMultivariable calculus and differential geometry<br>\nGroup theory<br>\nTopics that are not on that list but that I’d still be interested in working on in Lean, are dynamical systems, theory of computation, high dimensional geometry, and parts of mathematical physics.<br>\nI’m not really currently interested in topics such as: number theory, complex analysis (or mostly complex numbers generally), ring theory, representation theory.</p>\n<p>By the way, I’ve started <a href=\"#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/Starting.20with.20formalizing.20undergraduate.20math/near/201001840\">an earlier topic</a> a number of weeks ago, when I hadn’t gone through the Lean tutorials yet (mostly <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/\">#mil</a> and #TPIL), and this message basically supersedes that one.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that it would be good to start working within Lean on broadly one area so I build knowledge of how that area is formalized in Lean. So before picking my first problem it seems good to think about which area would be the best fit for me given my interests and given how doable it is to work on within Lean, etc. </p>\n<p>So it seems like it would be good to think about on the one hand, which area I should start with and on the other hand, which initial problem(s) to try. Based on the topics that are written in <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad_todo.html\">Missing undergraduate mathematics in mathlib</a>, my initial guess is that linear algebra or group theory would be the best fit, but people on Zulip chat seemed to have strong opinions about what are and aren’t good topics to start with, so I’m curious about people’s thoughts.</p>",

Regarding this, it seems that the (missing undergraduate math in mathlib)[https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad_todo.html] list is quite broad. i.e. it doesn't list pre-stated theorems that need proving, but mostly definitions and general topics.

I think proving that partial derivatives commute (or another suggestion by Gouezel, that  a C^k function is approximated by its k-th Taylor series up to o(norm(h) ^ k) ) is a possibility, but it's currently not the most interesting topic to me. But yes it's a possibility. Another topic from that thread: \"Commuting operators are simultatneously diagonalizable\" is  a possibility, though it seems complicated (I'd prefer to not deal with matrices, i.e. stay at a more abstract level, but it's a possibility).</p>",
