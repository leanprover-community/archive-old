But what got it to work more or less consistently was to add the <code>@[reducible]</code> annotation by the definitions of <code>bounded_stacks</code> etc.</p>\n<p>Also, to answer the original question I had, apparently you can get the inferred instance explicitly using <code>infer_instance</code>, though I don't usually need it anymore since Lean infers the typeclasses correctly.</p>",
