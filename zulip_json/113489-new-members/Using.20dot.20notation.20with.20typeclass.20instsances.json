This is sometimes done for typeclasses that are also props and intended to be used as such (i.e. participating in nontrivial logical positions like negations and disjunctions), like <code>nat.prime</code>. It's also necessary to specify typeclasses sometimes when the one that is inferred is not the one you want, which only happens occasionally, mostly when there is a non-defeq diamond in the typeclass hierarchy (which we try to avoid). Plus sometimes it's just the shortest way to write a proof</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thank you, Mario. I also changed the title of this thread to better reflect the subject it addresses.</p>",
