The problem here is that the goal is a disjunction.  Normally, I know that<br>\n<code> P \\or  Q </code> is equivalent to <code> \\not P \\-&gt; Q</code>, and so I would start with an intro to get <code>\\not P</code> in as a hypothesis, but I can't do that.  I've fiddled around with trying to introduce <code>\\not a \\le b</code> as a hypothesis, or do a by_cases on that, but lean says that it isn't decidable.  I'm stuck -- what am I missing here?  Remember that the natural number game rules are (or should be) restricted to the tactics that are given there.</p>",
