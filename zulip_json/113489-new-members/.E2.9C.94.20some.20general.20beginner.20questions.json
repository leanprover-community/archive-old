In Python world, the code itself is often good documentation! Besides that, I kept googling and poking around the LEAN documentation instead of realizing that mathlib is separate and I should look there too. Thanks! From the mathlib docs <code>tidy?</code> looks the tool I really was hoping would exist and to try with some basic exercises.</p>",
