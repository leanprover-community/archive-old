Now I just get the message \"Lean is busy ...\" because I suppose it's still rewriting \"a + t\" to \"t + a\" and back.  Is there anything I can do to stop or reset Lean?  If I press the reset button, will it reset my progress for just this world, or the whole game?<br>\nThanks in advance for any help.</p>",
