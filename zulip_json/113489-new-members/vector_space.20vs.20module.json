When I try to copy the code there, <code>vector_space</code> doesn't exist. But looking at the docs it looks like <code>module</code> means the same thing? But then the definition of <code>module</code> doesn't mention <code>field</code> like <code>vector_space</code> seems to from old mathlib versions. Are these really the same? Or is there another import where I can find the proper <code>vector_space</code>?</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"cp1AihuYr9k\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp1AihuYr9k\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/0b687d980cc56156fa7e185dc9dbd2f73223453b/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f637031416968755972396b2f64656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div>",
