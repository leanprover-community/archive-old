Can one pull a github dependency to a local machine easily using VS Code? Even that will not solve most of the problems. Both cocalc and my local ICT people have not given me a robust way of being able to add a growing library, and I didn't get this library written over the summer so I am having to write it now in real time.  However I do have a \"homework\" option with cocalc which I think should work. </p>\n<p>The vast majority of students use my Xena.zip set-up on a computer in our computer room, where Lean is installed on all machines by magic via my cheap instructions, and I forgot to put a back door in the zip file and they wrote the script and now it's difficult for me to get the set-up changed.

Hmm.</p>\n<p>I might go for making it all work out of the box on cocalc and then making public github repos for the problem sheets; I won't need to worry about .olean files because the libraries will be very small and easy to compile.
