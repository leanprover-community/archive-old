I'd like to contribute by adding definitions for homology and homotopy groups and proving some main results. I think it would make sense to start by introducing some basic category-theoretic definitions, such as the category of pointed spaces, the category of pairs, and the category of pointed pairs. Where would be a good place to make these definitions? Maybe in topology.category.Top.basic?</p>",
