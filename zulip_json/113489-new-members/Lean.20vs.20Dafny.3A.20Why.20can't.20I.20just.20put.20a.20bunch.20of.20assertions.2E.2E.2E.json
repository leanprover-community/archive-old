If for some reason the SMT solver can't find a proof, I can still add more <code>assert</code> statements to guide the solver. It seems that in Lean I have to do everything explicitly, sure there is <code>simp</code>, <code>omega</code> and <code>ring</code> but I have to explicitly invoke those solvers.  It may seem weird to ask this question but is this an intentional design choice of Lean? And why was that choice made?</p>",

ATP based provers are all about stating intermediate lemmas and letting the SMT backend fill the gaps, while ITPs are more about saying how the proof goes with tactics proving the individual steps (or even directly applying lemmas). The ATP approach is a lot more easy to use on simple problems, it can be almost completely hands off most of the time, but it tends to fail in really hard to predict ways when you start to scale up because you are at the mercy of the black box solver, which might fail because you wrote your hypotheses in the wrong order or something. This is bad for maintainability, and as Johan mentioned it's also really slow if your whole library is written this way</p>",
