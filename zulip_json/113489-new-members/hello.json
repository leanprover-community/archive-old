I think one thing which we are lacking right now but which is probably accessible is a whole bunch of predicates on ring homomorphisms, e.g. being flat, unramified, etale, finite presentation etc, and then transferring all these concepts over to morphisms of schemes. We have the category of schemes but nobody has begun to think about formalising any proofs which involve saying \"this morphism is locally X, therefore it is X\". There is an art to getting the definitions right in a theorem prover; with the wrong definitions, proving stuff is really slow going and painful. If you get the definition right however then it can be a dream. The problem is that in some sense the art of figuring out the correct definition is a very subtle one, and probably prover-dependent, so it's right now quite an adventure trying to figure out this stuff.</p>",

        "content": "<p>mathlib is designed as an integrated library of mathematics in general and that includes geometry. That means, for example, that setting up geometry at all involved first setting up affine spaces - but the work done on affine spaces in order to be able to say anything about geometry has since been used and extended by people working on lots of other things. It also means that other concepts we need in geometry should be set up in a more generally useful way (providing more generally useful definitions and lemmas is better than providing things very specific to Euclidean geometry). And when something is specific to geometry, it shouldn't be only two-dimensional unless the underlying concept is genuinely limited to two dimensions (for example, we have <code>circumcenter</code> defined for an arbitrary simplex, not just a triangle).</p>\n<p>For example, we need to be able to refer to betweenness of points, or points being inside triangles, to even state most IMO geometry problems. Defining that properly means first completing the refactor of convexity to apply to affine spaces, which has been discussed recently, which in turn seems to depend on a refactor of affine spaces so spaces with affine combinations over a semiring underlie a type class asserting those affine combinations agree with those coming from the <code>add_torsor</code> structure. That's also necessary before we can talk cleanly about e.g. the area of a triangle (linking to the measure theory parts of the library).</p>\n<p>For example, for oriented angles (which will probably turn out to be much more convenient for formal proofs than the unoriented angles we have, though IMO problems involving angles are stated with unoriented angles) we should first define orientations of vector spaces in general (again, see discussions on Zulip of how that might be done), rather than doing something ad hoc with complex numbers.</p>\n<p>I don't think the verbosity of geometry problems (compared to an informal statement) is any more than the verbosity of formal versions of results in other areas, once all the required definitions have been added. It's just that at this point, you probably need to write about 10000 lines more API, in geometry and things it depends on elsewhere in the library, before you can do much in the way of applying it to prove IMO geometry problems.</p>\n<p>So \"define orientations of vector spaces and prove a load of trivial lemmas about them\" is the sort of thing that's more practical at this point towards geometry than actually solving an IMO geometry problem.</p>",

In mathlib's graph theory library, we're focusing on encodings useful for theory rather than ones that are useful for efficient algorithms.
