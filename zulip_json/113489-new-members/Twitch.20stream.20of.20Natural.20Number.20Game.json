I mean, natural number game is a video game, right?   If it sounds interesting, please come watch and join the chat.  If this is a success I will try to stream other lean development projects in the future.  <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/ryan_mccorvie\">https://www.twitch.tv/ryan_mccorvie</a></p>",
