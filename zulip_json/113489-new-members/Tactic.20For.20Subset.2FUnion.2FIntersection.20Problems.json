        "content": "<p>For my program verification proof, I'm currently dealing with many simple tautologies that only involve the equality and subset predicate, unions, intersections, and the empty set (for finset). However, these tautologies turned out to be ugly to prove with lean. After I struggled to library_search my way to close the goals, I figured I could just transform all my subset relations to implications and simplify everything to make it a propositional problem. <code>finish</code> was then able to close the goal. However, <code>finish</code> is quite slow in my case and the *_iff rewrites are also not super beautiful. Are there any recommendations on how to tackle such tautologies? Is there even a specialized tactic?</p>\n<p>This is the set-part factored out of my lemma. Do you have ideas to improve this proof? Why is finish so slow here?

I didn't have to look up any of the names of the lemmas I used because these are all well-known to me now. I knew how to rewrite under binders; I also knew the maths proof and indeed I was just refactoring your code. I wasn't immediately sure how to deal with <code>disjoint l1 l2</code> to prove <code>false</code> but the first thing I tried (treating it as [x in things] -&gt; false) worked.</p>",

Originally, the infoview panel title was always \"Lean Messages\", and in February I changed it so that it was either \"Lean Messages\" or \"Lean Goal\" depending on whether it was displaying all server messages or just the tactic state + messages at the cursor. Then when Ed rewrote the infoview to use widgets in July, the title became \"Lean Infoview\". I wonder what the Lean 4 extension writers will settle on...</p>",
