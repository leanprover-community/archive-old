It's clear to all of us that reaching a <code>sorry</code>-free proof of <code>first_target</code> (aka theorem 9.4) is just a matter of time. So I think that we should think big, and look ahead a quite bit further. We now have a very clear idea of how to do homological algebra, and the derived functor RHom in the statement of 9.1 should be well within reach.<br>\nIn line with the Formal Abstracts proposal, we should focus more on definitions and theorem statements, and just <code>sorry</code> our way towards 9.1. We should then steam ahead, define pre-analytic rings and analytic rings, and state theorem 6.5 (that <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\R</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68889em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbb\">R</span></span></span></span></span> is an analytic ring). I'm optimistic that with our <code>sorry</code>-strategy, we can get there in a very short amount of time. We are spending way too much human capital on proving these <code>sorry</code>'s, but we should be leaving those to AIs that are getting better and better. See for example <a href=\"#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/Introducing.20GPT-AF/near/232700710\">GPT-AF</a> that is hot from the presses. In a couple of months these AIs will look at the gaps that we jump over and just fill them in without thinking twice.</p>\n<p>And then the fun begins! Once we have 6.5 stated in Lean, we can start freestyling!
