E.g. the naturality of the snake Œ¥, etc...<br>\nNot saying this is a useful trick right now for LTE. But it's just a thought that occured to me.</p>",

It probably just means you need to prove that some functors commute with the two projection functors from <code>arrow</code>, and the proofs probably end up being similar to proving naturality anyway.</p>",
