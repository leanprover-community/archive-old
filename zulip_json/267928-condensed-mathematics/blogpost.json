        "content": "<p>Here is a draft of a blogpost that we hope to publish really soon:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Completion of the Liquid Tensor Experiment</strong></p>\n<p>We are proud to announce that as of 15:46:13 (EST) on Thursday, July 14 2022 the Liquid Tensor Experiment has been <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid/commit/aa36e06b53778b97ada30c82979ae168521aee7b\">completed</a>. A year and a half after the <a href=\"https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2020/12/05/liquid-tensor-experiment/\">challenge</a> was posed by Peter Scholze we have finally formally verified the main theorem of liquid vector spaces using the Lean proof assistant. The blueprint for the project can be found <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/liquid/\">here</a> and the formalization itself is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>The first major milestone was <a href=\"https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2021/06/05/half-a-year-of-the-liquid-tensor-experiment-amazing-developments/\">announced</a> in June last year. The achievement was described in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01627-2\">Nature</a><br>\nand <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/lean-computer-program-confirms-peter-scholze-proof-20210728/\">Quanta</a>.</p>\n<p>For more information about Lean and formalization of mathematics, see the <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/\">Lean community website</a>.</p>\n<p>&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;</p>\n<p>The success of the project is the result of the hard work of many people in the Lean community. The project was led by Johan Commelin and relied on continuous mathematical support from Scholze himself. Adam Topaz contributed vast amounts of homological algebra and condensed mathematics.</p>\n<p>The other people involved in the formalization effort are as follows:<br>\nReid Barton,<br>\nAlex J. Best,<br>\nRiccardo Brasca,<br>\nKevin Buzzard,<br>\nYaël Dillies,<br>\nFloris van Doorn,<br>\nFabian Glöckle,<br>\nMarkus Himmel,<br>\nHeather Macbeth,<br>\nPatrick Massot,<br>\nBhavik Mehta,<br>\nScott Morrison,<br>\nFilippo A. E. Nuccio,<br>\nJoël Riou,<br>\nDamiano Testa,<br>\nAndrew Yang.</p>\n<p>In addition, the following provided valuable technical assistance:<br>\nMario Carneiro,<br>\nBryan Gin-ge Chen,<br>\nRob Lewis,<br>\nYakov Pechersky,<br>\nBen Toner,<br>\nEric Wieser,<br>\nleanprover-community-bot.<br>\nThe Liquid Tensor Experiment also heavily relied on many parts of <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/\">mathlib</a>,<br>\nthe main mathematical library for the Lean proof assistant.</p>\n<p>The project was completed at the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM) during the week-long workshop <a href=\"https://icerm.brown.edu/topical_workshops/tw-22-lean/\">Lean for the Curious Mathematician 2022</a>. Johan Commelin was supported by a Walter Benjamin position of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) to work on this project.<br>\nKevin Buzzard's work in this project was partially supported by a Microsoft Research grant. The Hoskinson Center for Formal Mathematics at Carnegie Mellon University provided server support.</p>\n</blockquote>",
