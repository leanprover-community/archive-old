We seem to have agreed on a definition involving changing the sign of the d's, so now we can start on the theorems. NB I don't care that we can't shift exact seqences of monoids, they are not the correct objects I don't think, at least right now. My impression is that exact sequences are the correct object when there is some kind of canonical isomorphism between isomorphism classes of subobjects of an object and isomorphism classes of quotient objects of the object (this is what the concept of a short exact sequence encapsulates somehow), and this is true for abelian groups and R-modules but not true for abelian monoids.</p>\n<p>The other point of view: note that for monoids there is only one way to shift -- you don't change any signs. For groups this \"naive shift\" is isomorphic to the proposed (-d) shift, but the analogue of this isomorphism (which is multiplication by -1 on each odd C_i) does not exist for monoids. In some sense this is an argument for not twisting d, on the grounds that it is the more natural construction as it works in more generality. I went through all this hell once, with different people using different notations: class field theory can be normalised in two different ways, so Shimura varieties can be normalised in two different ways, there are geometric and arithmetic frobenius and Tate modules of elliptic curves vs etale cohomology. Writing BDJ was a lot of work because of all these dualities, especially when some people did not clarify which normalisations they were using.</p>",
