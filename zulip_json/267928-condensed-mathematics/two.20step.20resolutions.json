First, I thought to use the resolution for Z and the forgetful functor to <code>AddCommGroup</code>, but this makes working with the terms very clumsy.<br>\nSo now there are two separate sets of definitions and theorems which are unrelated and basically copied over from each other.  I hope this makes working with them better because there will be good defeqs. And let's hope no one needs to comparison morphism too soon :)</p>\n<p>And feel free to suggest other names, <code>two_step_resolution</code> and <code>two_step_resolution_ab</code> were just the first ones that came to my mind.</p>",
