Now that the CI is using the Hoskinson runners (thank you, Johan and Scott!), there shouldn't be any more problems.</li>\n<li>Caches of oleans will now be stored for non-master branches... and the clean-up script is now updated so they won't then get deleted (thanks <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110596\">@Rob Lewis</span>!)</li>\n<li>The recent builds on master don't seem to be finding the right olean caches -- I'll look at this sometime if it persists.</li>\n<li>It would probably make sense to build in CI with a <code>-TXXXXXX</code> flag like mathlib does, even if <code>XXXXXX</code> is something high like <code>400000</code>. Currently we don't specify any <code>-TXXXXXX</code> flag.</li>\n<li>Likewise, when building locally, it might be a good idea to fix slow proofs. You can detect them by building, e.g., like this:</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Bash\"><pre><span></span><code>leanpkg configure\nleanproject get-mathlib-cache\nleanproject clean\nlean -T150000 --make src\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I won't have much time in the next couple of weeks but everything should be working anyway.</p>",
