I first suggested to split all the definitions that are relevant for the statement into a separate directory structure. But that quickly becomes messy. Then Adam suggested to have a directory <code>examples/</code> where we prove that certain gadgets are equal to what you expect them to be, by <code>rfl</code>. I really like this idea.</p>\n<p>Adam is currently preparing <code>examples/pBanach.lean</code>. The nice benefit is that we can also easily show that mathlib got things right, e.g. by having <code>examples/real.lean</code> that shows (thanks <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"127136\">@Alex J. Best</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"387244\">@Yaël Dillies</span>) that the reals form a conditionally complete linearly ordered field.<br>\nSimilarly, we can have <code>examples/measures.lean</code> and <code>examples/Ext.lean</code>.</p>",
