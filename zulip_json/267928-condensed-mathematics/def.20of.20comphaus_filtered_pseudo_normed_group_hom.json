The definition of <code>comphaus_filtered_pseudo_normed_group_hom</code> (in <code>pseudo_normed_group/profinitely_filtered.lean</code>) is supposed to capture the concept of a morphism of <code>comphaus_filtered_pseudo_normed_group</code>s. My memory was that Peter was reluctant to put a topology on the full underlying abelian group (although there are topologies on the filtrands), and right now the definition of a morphism f:M-&gt;N between two such things has to be \"continuous\" in the sense that if f happens to map the filtrand M_c into N_d then this induced map between topological spaces has to be continuous. </p>\n<p>OK so can the following happen: M is a <code>comphaus_filtered_pseudo_normed_group</code> and M=M_1=M_2 (this is the filtration), but the topologies on M_1 and M_2 are distinct, the inclusion from M_1 to M_2 is continuous, but the inclusion from M_2 to M_1 is not. If that's allowed then according to current definitions, the identity function is not continuous, because it happens to map M_2 into M_1 but this map isn't continuous. Is that OK?</p>",
