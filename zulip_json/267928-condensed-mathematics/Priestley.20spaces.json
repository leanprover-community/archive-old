And IMO the proof that schemes are quasi-sober and T0 should be split into proofs that prime spectra are quasi-sober and T0, and that quasi-sobriety and T0-ness are local properties. We currently lack a definition of \"local predicates\" on topological spaces, though we have theorems like <code>quasi_sober_of_open_cover</code>; locally (path) connectedness (are they defined in mathlib?) and semi-locally-simply-connectedness (setup for covering space theory) are also examples but spectrality is not.</p>",

Makkai's conceptual completeness theorem is a strengthening of Gödel's completeness theorem, and says that in some appropriate sense, a first order theory [the \"syntax\"] is determined by its models (with enough extra structure) [the \"semantics\"]. I gather it's in this way also some very souped up version of Birkhoff's representability theorem. In his course, Lurie uses ideas surrounding the pro-etale site etc, and then shows that there's a fully faithful functor from \"first order logic\" (appropriately made into a category) [the \"syntax\" side] to condensed categories [the \"semantics\" side].
