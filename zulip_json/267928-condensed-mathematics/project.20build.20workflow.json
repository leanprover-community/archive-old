Hmm, I've just noticed I'm not on leanproject 1.1.0 on this computer, maybe this has something to do with it; but I don't know <em>anything</em> about python and can never remember how to upgrade leanproject. Why can't I just do <code>leanproject upgrade</code> like I can do with e.g. elan? &lt;/rant&gt;</p>",
