Person A makes up a rule of which sequences of three numbers are \"good\" (the others are \"bad\"). The job of Person B is to figure out the rule. To get started, A gives an example of a good sequence. For example, they might say \"1,2,4\" is good. Then B asks \"is 1,3,6 good?\". A: Yes. B: Is 1,4,8 good? A: Yes. B: Is 1,5,10 good? A: Yes. B: Is the rule that 1,n,2n is good? A: No. B: Is 1,6,12 good? A: Yes. B: Is 1,7,14 good? A: Yes B: But you see, the rule is that 1,n,2n is good! A: No, that is not the rule.</p>\n<p>Apparently people are much rather trying to confirm their idea of what the rule is, then trying to prove it false by finding counterexamples. (In the experiment, A chose the rule \"any increasing sequence is good\", but virtually no person B ever chose any sequence violating that...)</p>\n<p>In the case at hand, I am psychologically predisposed to think that the computer is accurately capturing the mathematics, and your examples are confirming this; sometimes you've added lots of syntactic sugar to make it look seamless. But somehow these are all \"positive\" examples. I'm not exactly sure what I'm asking for; I guess I'm just currently feeling that mathematics remains a human activity, because if I were to truly check that the computer did the right thing, I would have to unravel the whole proof in my head and convince myself that it all adds up. (You might argue that I only need to check your examples file, but I'm not sure; for one, there's too much syntax I don't really understand and where something sneaky might hide; for the other, the examples files don't actually contain the definitions (because those need a lot of background...), so the above tale on confirmation bias becomes relevant, I think.)</p>\n<p>PS: In line 32 of Ext.lean, you say that the example gives the isomorphism of Ext-groups <em>functorially in X</em> (but not Y?). Why is functoriality in X built in? To me the statement reads like a non-functorial isomorphism. (Which probably just confirms that I don't actually understand what the Lean code means...)</p>",

        "content": "<p>I realize that Harris is talking about the translation here, and I agree with the sentiment that mathematics remains a human activity, but I think Harris has missed a key distinction. In mathematics as practiced today, the act of faith is in the <em>proofs</em> of the proposed results. Definitions are (and have been) frequently taken for granted. In fact, we often conflate multiple definitions for convenience by appealing to some notion of equivalence between the two. If I go to a conference on C⋆-algebras and start talking about them, no one will wonder whether or not I'm talking about a different definition than the one they are used to; in this sense, definitions (frequently) are an <em>implicit</em> act of faith.</p>\n<p>In contrast, when formalizing, it is <em>only</em> the definitions that one must take on faith, assuming one can adequately parse the statements of the theorems. In so doing, we have completely eliminated the previously required act of faith, and only now do we (i.e., your everyday mathematicians) realize that the implicit act of faith for definitions really should have been explicit all along. </p>\n<p>Moreover, by formalizing enough theorems, one can verify the usual behavior of a given object, thereby minimizing the possibility that they are defined in a way sufficiently different to cause problems. That is, if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is generally (although admittedly not always) a duck.</p>\n<p>So, does formalization completely eliminate all acts of faith for a human to \"verify\" for themselves the correctness of a certain theorem? No, but it greatly shifts where our faith rests.</p>",

To a human it's easier to convince themselves that there are enough ideas in there to get a proof, than to say with absolute certainty that all the definitions entering the theorem statement are correct.</p>\n<p>Even after your example files, it could be that a lot of things are secretly zero, and it's an absolute impossibility for me to read enough of the Lean code to check all your definitions -- it's just way too much buildup! (And this checking would require me to have a much better understanding of Lean's syntax.)</p>\n<p>Arguably, this issue becomes less pressing once a lot of stuff is in a trusted library like mathlib. So if somebody proves a theorem and formalizes it, then the referee has an easy job if all the definitions entering their main theorem are in that library. But much of the development of mathematics lies in finding good definitions! So in a paper with new definitions and theorems <em>about those new definitions</em>, the refereeing process will be almost as tedious as before, if not more (as now one has to be make sure the definitions are absolutely correct before they can be allowed to enter the library).</p>\n<p>What happened in the first half of LTE is that I could really see how you were following the manuscript line-by-line and, in the process of carefully translating it into Lean, catching a number of small slips. This type of process is certainly something where formal proof verification is doing an excellent job, and it really radically changed my confidence in the argument. However, the second half of LTE has not added anything to my confidence (but it was already at 100% ;-) , so maybe that's not saying much).

I think for an outsider, it's definitely easier to be convinced by reading some of the definitions and examples that you give, in order to trust that you probably have the definitions right, and to read the final statement (which certainly is very clean!). But I'd argue that this process will not get up to 100% confidence, and I feel that in this specific situation for me, the confidence level I can get via this procedure is below the one I have via other means.</p>",
