I'm not following the maths, but I'm assuming these are alternatives... is that right?</p>\n<p>The current linting workflow creates a file <code>all.lean</code> which imports everything in <code>src</code>, i.e., both of these. It seems totally reasonable to me to have alternate implementations on master but I don't know the right way to fix the linter to deal with this. As a temporary fix, I've excluded <code>proetale_site_as_small.lean</code> from being included in <code>all.lean</code>.</p>",
