Notes for others who want to do this for the first time:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I used \"StreamLabs OBS\" which is free and has windows and Mac versions, idk how easy it is to install on linux.</li>\n<li>It took me about 30 minutes of fiddling with StreamLabs settings before I was ready to go live. There are many tutorial videos on youtube.</li>\n<li>It helps to have a second monitor to do the programming on, so you can use your first monitor to watch twitch chat and deal with admin-y things</li>\n<li>If you want Twitch to save a recording of the stream, you have to check a box in your settings before you start</li>\n</ol>",
