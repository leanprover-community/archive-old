And computers are really very very good at dealing with redundancy. And there is some existing meta-mathematics, and some to-be-done meta-mathematics, that can tell us that this redundancy is not an illusion but really is structural. So it <strong>should</strong> be leveraged.</p>\n<p>Thus we should be actively working towards making sure that humans don't have to do work that is automatable. And find ways to augment our meta-mathematics to really use that structure to its fullest.</p>\n<p>If someone decided that the way we're doing things is all wrong, and provided a better, more elegant way to do things, as long as they cite us <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span> , I would consider that a total win!</p>\n<p>It is however very important to differentiate between information obtainable for free, and information that is true but requires a trivial but <strong>non-uniform</strong> proof. For example, that preservation of unit in a group is not needed in the definition of homomorphism, because it is derivable. One should not expect a uniform mechanism to deal with that, as that is not 'free'.</p>",
