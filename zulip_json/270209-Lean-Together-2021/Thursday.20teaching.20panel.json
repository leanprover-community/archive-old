How hard is it to install nix (the package manager)? I've never tried installing the package manager itself (although I did use nixos for a little while)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Btw, my dream for this is that there is nothing to install at all. There should be a script you can <code>curl | sh</code> that downloads a statically linked Nix binary, puts it and its store in a dot directory, and opens a shell that removes all of that again on exit unless you call a command for activating a permanent installation. This should actually be almost in reach <em>on Linux</em> except for a bug on Nix <code>master</code> related to local (user-namespaced) stores. There is no such option on macOS, so that would be still one less platform.</p>",
