Because this event is spread across so many time zones, we think this is important to make the event accessible. And recordings from past events have been surprisingly popular on YouTube. Speakers: if you would prefer us <em>not</em> to record your talk, please tell us before your presentation.</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"channel\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWe5B7Ikr0AI9727doEUxPg\"><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/channel/default.jpg\"></a></div>",
