This is great!</p>\n<p>The reason I mentioned Grassmannians was for the following very silly one. We can now say \"Lean has spheres!\" but of course the HoTT people can reply \"HoTT has spheres and furthermore they're defined in 3 lines and not 1200\". Of course the difference is that a HoTT sphere is synthetic and yours are analytic, but people who are only paying a superficial interest won't be able to tell the difference. My understanding is that it is not known how to make Grassmannians synthetically -- we \"don't know the generators and relations\" in some sense -- so it would be something to tell someone who says \"HoTT has spheres\".</p>",
