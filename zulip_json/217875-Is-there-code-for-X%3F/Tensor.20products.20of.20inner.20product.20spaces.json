Wikipedia does give a universal property for the Hilbert tensor product but it involves weakly Hilbert Schmidt bilinear maps (which means a whole lot of API to add) and I don't think it will be super useful in practice. Another option is proving that we have the universal property of the completion of the algebraic tensor product, but that means defining the inner product on it, at which point it would be simpler to just define the Hilbert tensor product as a completion. So I think the only remaining option is to rely on the characterization by Hilbert bases, which is extremely unsatisfying...</p>",
