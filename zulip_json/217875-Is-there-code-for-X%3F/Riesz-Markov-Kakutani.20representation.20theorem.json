Although the primary goal is to have a topic for a summer project and not necessarily directly contribute to mathlib (we can decide about that later), I think it is nicer to choose a topic that doesn't obviously duplicate work (especially by experts). So: is anyone working / planning to work on that now or during the summer?</p>\n<p>One implementation choice that I will suggest is to treat <code>nnreal</code>-valued functions first (the \"positive linear functional\" part is then naturally baked in, and the measures are usual <code>ennreal</code>-valued measures) and only later extend to real-valued functions and signed measures. This is inspired by how <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/measure_theory.finite_measure.topological_space\">docs#measure_theory.finite_measure.topological_space</a> was done following Heather's suggestion (I realize that I have not yet PR'd the pairing with real-valued functions there, but I will, soon). Comments are of course welcome! And we'd keep asking questions here <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span>.</p>",
