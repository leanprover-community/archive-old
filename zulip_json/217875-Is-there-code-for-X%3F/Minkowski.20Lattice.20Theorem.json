At the time I came to the conclusion that measure theory needed more development to prove some of the key results, <a href=\"#narrow/stream/263328-triage/topic/random.20PR.3A.20.5BWIP.5D.20feat.28number_theory.2Fgeometry_of_numbers.29.3A.2E.2E.2E/near/215254314\">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/263328-triage/topic/random.20PR.3A.20.5BWIP.5D.20feat.28number_theory.2Fgeometry_of_numbers.29.3A.2E.2E.2E/near/215254314</a> I think a lot of this is now possible thanks to the work of many people (lots of credit to Floris and Yury though!). So I definitely think its high time to revive this PR, or rewrite it completely lol. I think I will have more time for lean in the next few weeks (I just submitted my PhD thesis today!) so I'm happy to collaborate on this <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span>.</p>",
