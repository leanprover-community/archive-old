Essentially, I want to define a function or a family of functions that maps elements belonging to a list or a set (say, of natural numbers) to a boolean. So far, I've considered optional types and providing the list in the definition:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">def</span> <span class=\"n\">opt_func</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">nat</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">option</span> <span class=\"n\">bool</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">def</span> <span class=\"n\">dep_func</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">ns</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">list</span> <span class=\"n\">nat</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"bp\">∀</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">nat</span><span class=\"o\">),</span> <span class=\"n\">n</span> <span class=\"bp\">∈</span> <span class=\"n\">ns</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">bool</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>However, I don't know which of these is preferable, or if there is a third option that is better. Any thoughts or references to similar concepts in mathlib would be very helpful.</p>",

If you didn't constrain the junk values like this, then there can be multiple nonequal functions that do the same thing.  This can sometimes be a problem when proving or counting things.</p>",
