I don't trust myself to formalise the statement, because I don't understand the implementation decisions that have been made. I don't want to be making levels, I want to be proving theorems. If the experts could formalise the statement it would be brilliant. If you use an undefined typeclass like [is_smooth_curve] or whatever, then we could just skip the proof that the closed unit disc is a closed curve, for example. If there is more than one possibility for setting this question up, and you think it's worth an experiment, then just guess one and we can try it.</p>",
