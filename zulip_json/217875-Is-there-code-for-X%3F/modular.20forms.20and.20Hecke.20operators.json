Now I was thinking of going a bit further and trying to not just get the definition up and running but also Hecke operators and hopefully proving that Delta and some Eisenstein series are actually modular forms.  Ultimately proving something like multiplicty one would be great.  </p>\n<p>Given I'm pretty new to this area, I wanted to check if  this has already been done/ is being done. I couldn't really find anything, but I also don't know exactly where to look.</p>",

I was just thinking about seeing how far one can get without them.</p>",
