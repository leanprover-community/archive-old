In general, if we don't know what <code>e</code> is, then we have no way to determine <code>eq.rec a e</code>, so <code>h'</code> isn't really useful. On the other hand, for any 'concrete' proof <code>e' : a = b</code>, we can evaluate <code>eq.rec a e'</code> explicitly. And <code>eq.rec a e' = eq.rec a e</code> by proof irrelevance. So in this case <code>h'</code> actually tells us something useful, namely that <code>eq.rec a e' = b</code>.</p>",
