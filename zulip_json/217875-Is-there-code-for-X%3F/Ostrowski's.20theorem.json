I'm really unsure of how much I can get through, even before I try adding Lean to the mix. The course is for â‰¥2nd year PhD students who haven't seen p-adic numbers before, and I was (very ambitiously) hoping to cover Tate's thesis (just over Q, doing adelic Poisson summation and functional equation for zeta and Dirichlet L-functions), followed by Gelfand-Graev-PS (that is, adelic automorphic representations on GL(2), again just over Q). I had in mind for the first lecture to prove Ostrowski, which is very fun, and to me \"explains\" why there're the reals and p-adics and nothing else. But then I was shocked that even that's not in mathlib (yet). I suppose I'll experiment with whether trying to formalize live (with lots of <code>sorry</code>s everywhere) turns out to be a terrifically bad idea... I might abandon the experiment after a lecture or two and reach for the safety blanket of the blackboard...</p>",
