In some sense this could be difficult to formalize because differential equations and their solutions can be understood in many ways.  ODE is often thought as a (smooth) vector field. On the other hand a PDE can be thought as a submanifold in jet spaces, or as a map between for example Banach spaces. Also solutions can be interpreted in many ways, for example as integral manifolds or elements in Sobolev spaces.</p>",

Surely one should define a type of differential equation before talking about Banach spaces? Note that in textbooks differential equations are not really seriously defined in general, see for example Evans, PDE, page 2.</p>\n<p>I see some problems even on very elementary level. Consider x'=Ax+f; even in elementary applications one wants to allow discontinuous f or even Dirac's deltas. But then we have equality only in the sense of distributions (or otherwise weak inequality). But then what kind of operator is A?  If we allow x to be a general (time dependent) distribution, then A is essentially multiplication by a smooth function which is not what we want.  </p>\n<p>Then if L is the laplacian then the fundamental solution is the solution of -Lu=delta, again with equality in the sense of distributions. But here the fundamental solution can be interpreted to be in many different spaces. So again one would need the concept/term/type of differential equation before introducing Banach (or other) spaces. </p>\n<p>So we have the \"formal unknown\" u, and then \"solution\" u which is in some specific space. </p>\n<p>Now I don't know if these speculations are at all relevant or interesting in the context of LEAN. I guess my point is that it would be interesting to see if it is possible to have a reasonable definition of differential equation. But as I said above I'm new to LEAN so I have no idea how to proceed concretely in this direction.</p>",

And in PDE theory as we know it there is a lack of abstraction -- or maybe there are many competing abstractions, none of which actually cover the full theory.</p>\n<p>For now, we just try to develop the theories in <em>some</em> way, and build the usual \"bridges\" between different points of view explicitly, even if they are a bit clunky.
