Yes indeed I was mostly implying that performing it takes very specific knowledge and therefore a very rare specialist to do it. I don't doubt that there's no theoretical obstacle or some insurmountable spike of proof complexity.</p>\n<p>Proving that a general quintic is insoluble in radicals can indeed be considered a milestone. A good showcase for galois theory. But the result is more well-known, so there probably are much more people who'll readily understand it.</p>",

Nobody is talking about an algorithmic approach to computing antiderivatives here.
