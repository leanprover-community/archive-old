As far as I can tell the version you're linking is totally independent of this one which I find strange but I'm sure there's a reason.<br>\nIf you're curious why I care about this version, I'm working with base b expansions of real numbers building on one of <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"110038\">@Kevin Buzzard</span>'s experiments, and from a sequence of digits I get a real number using the cauchy sequence of summing up just the first n digits of the number.
