I'm curious if there's a way to look at 'raw proof terms' as constructed by using tactics. I'm a bit new to this so I might be misunderstanding something, but can I somehow get the low-level, functional lean code from a higher-level proof? To give some context, I'm interested in pattern mining and analysis of proofs in lean, and for that I would like to explore what existing ways there are to actually access things like syntax trees for existing lean code. I'm not quite sure what I would be searching for in order to find this on google... Thanks!</p>",
