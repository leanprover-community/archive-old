Atoms/urelements can be elements of sets, but have no elements themselves.  To keep atoms from being equal to the empty set, extensionality must be weakened to only talk about non-atoms.  These are useful to show the independence of AC from the rest of ZF set thoery.</p>\n<p>It doesn't look like the existing code for ZFC models is well equipped to talk about permutation models; or for that mater any interesting model of set theory not produced by just cutting the universe off at an inaccessible (like L).</p>\n<p>Is implementing these a reasonable first project, or are there some major difficulties I don't see yet?</p>",
