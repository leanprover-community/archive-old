My use case is that I want to convert a finite type involving vectors to a more general one that uses lists. I want the finite type to use vectors so that I can easily get <code>finset.univ</code> and those kinds of things. But in order to prove that my embedding is injective, I need that when two lists of the same length are equal, the corresponding vectors are equal. Maybe there's a better way?</p>",
