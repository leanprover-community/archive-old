(That is, for some ordering A_1, A_2, ... A_k of the sets in <code>S</code>, we have x = a_1 + ... + a_k with a_i \\in A_i). This is of course easy if we replace <code>multiset (set int)</code> with <code>list (set int)</code> as we have a way to index <code>S</code>, but this approach breaks a symmetry in the definition. I can't see how to do this <code>multiset.map</code>, because this requires a function term <code>f : set int → int</code>, which doesn't really exist here.</p>",

The way I stated things is a toy example; what I actually have is a <code>multiset T</code> for some type <code>T</code>, a term <code>X : set T' </code>, and I want to assert the existence of a family of terms of type <code>set T'</code>, indexed by the elements of the multiset, each of which must satisfy some predicate depending on the multiset element, whose union is <code>X</code>. And here, union could be any associative, commutative operation. Could there be a place for a 'dependent multiset folding' at this level of generality in mathlib?</p>",
