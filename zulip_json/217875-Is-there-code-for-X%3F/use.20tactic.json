I just mean that folks don't tend to like qualified imports, or minimizing plopping things in the global namespace, as much as in Python (which seems safe for a language like Lean but requires active energy coming from Python I think to not care about as much. To a Python programmer I'd say \"use <code>from</code> imports as little as possible, and never import lots of stuff into the global namespace\", and in Lean I just get the perspective that the reverse is generally preferred, folks will sometimes comment \"why do you keep writing <code>foo.something</code>, get rid of the <code>foo.</code> with an open.)</p>",

        "content": "<p>A big difference between Python and Lean is how they handle the \"linkage\" problem, which is how do global variables end up actually referring to values?</p>\n<p>The Python system: there are <code>module</code> objects, and a module contains a name-&gt;value mapping. When a module file is loaded it creates a <code>module</code> and (1) each module it imports gets added to this module's mapping (where <code>from foo import x</code> goes and copies the value for <code>x</code> in <code>foo</code> to this module), and (2) each function that gets defined gets a reference to the current module, since that way when that function is evaluated, it's able to evaluate global variables in the context of the module it was defined in. Modules double as a sort of hierarchical namespacing system, since when you import a module the module itself gets added to the current module's mapping, so <code>foo.x</code> turns into \"look up <code>foo</code> in the current module, then ask <code>foo</code> for <code>x</code>.\"</p>\n<p>The Lean system: there are two orthogonal systems, environments and modules. The environment is a name-&gt;value mapping, and each module you import extends the environment (and the name of the module may have no relation to the names it adds to the environment). There is a namespacing system from having hierarchical names. Then the <code>open foo</code> command just adds aliases to the environment for everything with the <code>foo</code> prefix, but any references to aliases get resolved into fully qualified names during elaboration time. There's an expectation that names will never be reused between different modules. This means that when a definition is evaluated, it can evaluate global variables by looking up a declaration by its fully qualified name alone, in any environment that contains that definition. This is useful when it comes to proving things because definitions can be unfolded, and any names you see are ones you can refer to yourself. I imagine this also makes passing things to the Lean kernel for final verification simpler.</p>\n<p>The Lean system is sort of like Common Lisp's, where there are symbol packages (a complicated form of hierarchical names) and each symbol package contains some name-&gt;symbol mapping. Unlike Lean, each symbol directly contains the value it refers to, and the way the <code>open</code> equivalent works is that a reference to the symbol is added to another symbol package. Linkage happens at parse time, so when a function is evaluated it's able to evaluate global variables by just asking the symbol itself for its value.</p>\n<p>In principle, Lean could allow you to do \"tree shaking\" and add only those declarations to the environment that are transitively necessary to work with a given declaration. But, in practice, since you're not supposed to reuse fully qualified names between different modules, I guess you don't need this sort of surgical namespace management.</p>",
