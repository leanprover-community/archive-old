Every definition and inductive in Lean only depends on a finite number of universes, no matter what concrete levels you instantiate the universe parameters with.  A potential definition of <code>cardinal_set.{u}</code> could hence only refer to, say, 3, universes, and therefore <code>cardinal_set.{5}</code> can be interpreted as different sets depending on how you interpret the sequence <code>Type</code>.  (In fact you can think of definitions/inductives as schemes.  Every definition/inductive generates an infinite number of definitions/inductives that only differ by the universe levels.)</p>",
