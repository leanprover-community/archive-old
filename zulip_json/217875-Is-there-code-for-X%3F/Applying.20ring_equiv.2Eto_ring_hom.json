I think perhaps the issue is that <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/ring_equiv.to_ring_hom_eq_coe\">docs#ring_equiv.to_ring_hom_eq_coe</a> should be a simp lemma.  Such things usually are, it might be an accidental omission here.  Then the proof can be <code>by simp</code>.</p>",
