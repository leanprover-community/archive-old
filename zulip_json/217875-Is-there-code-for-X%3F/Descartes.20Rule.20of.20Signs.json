The list of 100 theorems on the Lean community website (<a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/100-missing.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/100-missing.html</a>) lists Descartes' Rule of Signs as still missing. This seems like a possible direction to take my students. Does anyone know if anyone is already working on this?<br>\nThanks.</p>",
