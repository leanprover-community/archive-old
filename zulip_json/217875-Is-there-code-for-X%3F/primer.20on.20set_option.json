I am currently looking for an option to \"see\" the value that Lean assigned to an underscore in the application of a lemma, and some combinations of <code>set_option pp.all true</code> or <code>set_option trace.type_context.is_def_eq_detail true</code> and <code>trace.class_instances true</code> help a bit. Yet, it is completely obscure to me what I am doing, and I wonder how I could get a general picture.</p>\n<p>Also, if I try a \"stupid thing\" like <code>set_option pp.foo true</code>, VSCode tells me <code>unknown option 'pp.foo', type 'help options.' for list of available options</code> and I am stuck with the stupid question : \"<em>Where</em> should I type <code>help options</code>?\"</p>",
