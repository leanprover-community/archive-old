A basis for the Pi.topological_space topology on alpha -&gt; beta is indexed by pairs (a,U) with a : alpha and U in beta an open set, the corresponding open set of functions being the f such that f(a) is an element of U. It suffices to prove that the preimage of this basis element is open in the compact open topology. However a singleton {a} is compact, so in fact the preimage of (a,U) is one of the generators for the compact open topology.</p>",
