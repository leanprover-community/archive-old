What I need is to show that, given a continuous function on [0, 1] with f 0 = f 1 (e.g. the Bernoulli polynomial B_k(x) for k != 1), I can make from it a continuous function on <code>unit_add_circle</code>. My first attempt was to extend f to a periodic function on ℝ by composing with <code>int.frac</code>, show that this is continuous, and then apply <code>continuous_quot_lift</code>. But that involved a great deal of rather painful mucking around with <code>continuous_within_at</code> to show continuity at the bad points.</p>",

The reason I want to do this is because -- in the case when B is the k-th Bernoulli polynomial -- it happens to be the case that the n-th Fourier coefficient of P(x) is (constant) / n^k, and thus if you can show that the Fourier series of P converges pointwise to P, you get values of the Riemann zeta function (and in fact of all Dirichlet L-functions, by taking weighted sums of values at rationals in [0, 1].</p>",
