A <code>triangle</code> bundles three affinely independent points. But neither \"three\" or \"affinely independent\" is needed at all for results on congruence, so those results aren't really about triangles at all, they've about indexed families and should be stated and proved accordingly (unless the triangle result is actually needed separately to derive the arbitrary-dimension result, but I don't think it is).</p>\n<p>You could, for example, probably derive the result (a) from my previous comment using <code>inner_weighted_vsub</code> to show that a subfamily of points in one family is affinely independent iff and only if the corresponding subfamily of points in the other family (with the same pairwise distances) is, and proving further lemmas that apply to any affine space (over a vector space) to deduce the dimension property from that. Then for (b) you might define some concrete isometries that you use in an induction step, to go from an isometric equivalence mapping corresponding points in an affine subspace to one that makes corresponding points in a larger affine subspace match as well. Once you have SSS congruence in such a general form for indexed families of points, you could deduce SAS congruence (i.e. if all distances from a single point in the family, and all angles at that point, match in the two families, then you have congruence under the same conditions as before), because knowing the distances and angles at one point in the family immediately gives you all the other pairwise distances. Again, the result being proved is not restricted at all to triangles (although you may have used the law of cosines to determine the other pairwise distances from the distances and angles at one point).</p>",
