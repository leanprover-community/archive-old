He has long argued that a lot of the time we want to transfer stuff along some notion of \"the same\", there is a more general theorem which transfers stuff along a weaker notion which is reflexive and transitive but not symmetric, and which should not be proved by a tactic. For example when I said \"a machine should prove that if top spaces X and Y are homeomorphic, and X is compact, then Y is compact\", and Mario said \"no. A human should notice, and prove in the API, that if X surjects onto Y and X is compact then Y is compact, and the translation along a homeo is a trivial special case\". The same is true here. Ken has actually proved that if C -&gt; D is a right adjoint and C is filtered then D is filtered, and deduces the result from this and the fact that equivalences (symmetric) are right adjoints (and this concept is not symmetric -- if there's a right adjoint from C to D there might not be a right adjoint from D to C).</p>",
