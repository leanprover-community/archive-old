This year I'm officially teaching an algebra course to very good third year students (at <a href=\"https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en\">ENS Paris-Saclay</a>). These students are frustrated because their curriculum doesn't include a proper course in general topology (they have a detailed course about metric spaces spaces). Some of them repeatedly asked me to teach them general topology. Last week I accepted and gave a first underground topology course by night on our BigBlueButton server. It means I'm totally free to teach it my way and students are free to leave at any time. I couldn't resist running an experiment. So, after some introduction, I started with 20 minutes about lattices and Galois connections, then I moved to filters for about one hour and only after that I defined topological spaces. I'm pretty pleased about how it went and students seemed very happy. We'll see how many come back in Week 2. I'll tell you when I'll move to uniform spaces and Bourbaki real numbers. Note that I didn't use Lean, this is a much sneakier way to sell formalized maths than what I do with my first year undergrads.</p>",

For example could one prove step through the Tychonoff proof using ultrafilters in a painless way in Lean?</p>\n<p>Do we have in Lean that in a compact Hausdorff space there's a unique uniform structure compatible with the topology?</p>\n<p>My memories of the undergraduate course I took was that continuous image of compact is compact, compact subspace of Hausdorff is closed, and closed subset of compact is compact were some pretty cool theorems.
