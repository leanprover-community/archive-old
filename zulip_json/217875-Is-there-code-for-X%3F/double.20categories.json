He will start by creating the definition etc in Lean. However, we were wondering whether there are preferences in the community for the way we do this. The first question is whether we implement them as internal categories in Cat (I think that internal categories still need to be introduced as well) or as a new type of category that has two types of arrows and double cells, etc. Of course one can easily be turned into the other. The other question is whether we can just introduce strict double categories and leave the weaker versions to be developed in the future. (For our current project we only need strict ones.)  I have noticed that for 2-categories and bicategories it seems that the community has taken the approach that bicategories are defined and 2-categories are a special kind of bicategories (please correct me if I have missed something). There are a couple of ways of making double categories weaker and providing all the code to do this is significantly more work (plus that my student is just learning about double categories and I would rather have him become familiar with the strict version before he needs to take care of all the additional structure cells and coherence).</p>",
