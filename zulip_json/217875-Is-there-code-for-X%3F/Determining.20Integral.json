        "content": "<p>Hi,</p>\n<p>I'm working with a group that is trying to formalize scientific equations and I had a question about integration. I'm pretty sure I understand setting up the derivative notation and I understand the general Lebesgue integral notation. I was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction to go about showing that if a function, (f : a -&gt; b), has a second derivative equal to 0, then f must be of the form C1*a+C2. This also leads into another question I had where if I define a function, (f : a -&gt; b), can I then go on to define that f is of the form, say, a^2+2? Also, how would this work if I had a function that took in two varaibles, like (f : a-&gt;b-&gt;c), and I wanted to say f is of the form a<em>b. So far I've run into the problem where Lean expects a</em>b to be of type c, but a is of type a and b is of type b, and it also can't multiply type a by type b. I may be going around this the wrong way, still learning about Lean and math formalization. Thank you for your help! <span aria-label=\"smiley\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f603\" role=\"img\" title=\"smiley\">:smiley:</span></p>",

        "content": "<p>I attached the code I have so far. I defined a function f, and defined its first and second derivative, and that f'' = 0. Our current goal is to derive the four basic kinematic equations from two differential equations, V = dx/dt and a = dV/dt. For instance, I can show from those two equations that v = v0+a*t, which is a function for velocity which is the initial velocity plus the acceleration multiplied by time. My original thought was to define f  as a function that mapped a t --&gt; X, which mapped a time (t) to a position (X), but I think from Junyan's response, I am understanding the meaning of f : t--&gt; X wrong. Also, with the code attached below, a problem I am having is how to formulate the statement I want to prove, so I left it as a comment. </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">analysis.calculus.fderiv</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">measure_theory.measure.measure_space</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">universes</span> <span class=\"n\">u_1</span> <span class=\"n\">u_2</span> <span class=\"n\">u_3</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">example</span>\n<span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"kt\">Type</span> <span class=\"n\">u_1</span><span class=\"o\">}</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">X</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span> <span class=\"n\">u_2</span><span class=\"o\">}</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"bp\">𝕜</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span> <span class=\"n\">u_3</span><span class=\"o\">}</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">--Create normed space for each variable</span>\n<span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">normed_group</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"o\">]</span>\n<span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">normed_space</span> <span class=\"n\">ℝ</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"o\">]</span>\n<span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">normed_group</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span> <span class=\"o\">]</span>\n<span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">normed_space</span> <span class=\"n\">ℝ</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"o\">]</span>\n<span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">measurable_space</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"o\">]</span>\n<span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">μ</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">measure_theory.measure</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"o\">}</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">--Define f as a function that represents the distance at any time t</span>\n<span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">f</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n<span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">τ</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n<span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">f'</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span><span class=\"n\">L</span><span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">ℝ</span><span class=\"o\">]</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"o\">)}</span>\n<span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">f''</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span><span class=\"n\">L</span><span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">ℝ</span><span class=\"o\">]</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span><span class=\"n\">L</span><span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">ℝ</span><span class=\"o\">]</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"o\">}</span>\n<span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">h1</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">has_fderiv_at</span> <span class=\"n\">f</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">f'</span> <span class=\"n\">τ</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"n\">τ</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\">--Has a first derivative</span>\n<span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">h2</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">has_fderiv_at</span> <span class=\"n\">f'</span> <span class=\"n\">f''</span> <span class=\"n\">τ</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\">--Has a second derivation</span>\n<span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">h3</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">f''</span> <span class=\"bp\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\">--second derivative is 0</span>\n<span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">t0</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"o\">}</span>\n<span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">t1</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">t</span><span class=\"o\">}</span>\n<span class=\"o\">:</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">--f is linear</span>\n<span class=\"o\">:=</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">begin</span>\n<span class=\"gr\">sorry</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">end</span>\n</code></pre></div>",
