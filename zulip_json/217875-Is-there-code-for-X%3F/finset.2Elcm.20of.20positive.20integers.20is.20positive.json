I'm almost done proving the equivalence of the two definitions (via minimal n such that g^n=1 for all g and lcm of order). The only small sorry that is missing is that the lcm of a finset of positive integers is positive. Is this somewhere or at least something close enough? I'm also not sure what the right generality of such a result is apart from natural numbers.</p>",
