The reals and complexes, or, more precisely, normed fields which are isomorphic to the complexes (sometimes we don't know which way is up) are sometimes called local fields or archimedean local fields, but some authors use local field to mean nonarchimedean local field. Some proofs really do really on the nonarchimedean property of the norm. And then there's the issue that some people allow nonarch local fields with infinite residue field and others don't, depending on whether they're doing something geometric (where it often doesn't matter) or arithmetic (where it can be crucial). Langlands goes out of his way to make \"unified\" statements whenever he can, including the reals, p-adics, and characteristic p local fields, and their finite extensions, but often in the proofs you split into cases depending on whether the norm is nonarchimedean or not. It's a bit of a mess :-/ In nonarchimedean analysis we care much less about finiteness of residue field and then the situation is much closer to what you describe, typically you just need completeness and the existence of an element of norm strictly between 0 and 1 so you can scale. The open mapping theorem comes under that category because it's analytic rather than arithmetic.</p>",
