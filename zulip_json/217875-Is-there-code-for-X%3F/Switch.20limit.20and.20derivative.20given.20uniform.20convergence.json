(I'm not sure if Morera's Theorem is already proved in the library or not.) IIRC, they both eventually invoke the mean value theorem a couple of times. I'd be curious how you're handling that (as it seems a bit of a pain in the butt :-) ).</p>",

(at least how I did it), but we have <code>tendsto_integral_of_dominated_convergence</code> which does the hard bit.  </p>\n<p>So I don't think there is a mean value theorem in the complex case (or at least what I think of the MVT to be saying, but in the real case there is, and so this is how I would do it), so I just commute the limit and integral and then show one can differentiate under the integral. The big inputs in this case come from the Cauchy integral formula.</p>",
