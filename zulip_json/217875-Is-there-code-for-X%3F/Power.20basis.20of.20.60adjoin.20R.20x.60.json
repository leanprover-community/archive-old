I think you can show relatively easily that the R-minpoly of an integral element in S is the same as the K-minpoly: both are monic, and the latter always divides the former (<a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/minpoly.dvd\">docs#minpoly.dvd</a>).</p>\n<p>To get the power basis, you need that the kernel of the map R[X]-&gt;S sending X to x is generated by the R-minpoly. For any element in the kernel, if you take the remainder modulo the R-minpoly, you get something of lower degree which is still in the kernel, so the K-minpoly divides it, so it's either zero or has degree at least the degree of the K-minpoly, which is the same as the degree of the R-minpoly, so it can only be zero.</p>",
