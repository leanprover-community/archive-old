After searching a bit I found <a href=\"https://coq.inria.fr/refman/addendum/nsatz.html\">Nsatz</a>, a Coq tactic that seems to do this sort of thing. I am not too familiar with the Nullstellensatz, but I see there is a file on it in mathlib. Does something like the Nsatz tactic exist for Lean? Does anyone have thoughts on how easily this algorithm could be implemented based on what already does exist?</p>",
