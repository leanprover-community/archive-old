I only found related code in <code>number_theory/pell.lean</code>, but inside it only proves the special case <code>d = a^2 - 1</code> for <code>x^2 - dy^2 = +-1</code>. If not, I would like to make progress on this! However, it seems like a large project to me, so if anyone can give me some directions on where to start then that will be great. Do I just follow some textbook / notes and grind through the lemmas one by one? Thanks! :)</p>",

It's now rather difficult to contribute to mathlib as an undergraduate; perhaps the best idea might be to choose something from the <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad_todo.html\">undergrad todo list</a>, although please open a discussion before embarking on something because there will be opinions about how to set up definitions, or half-finished work you can build on etc. The other situation is that adding anything to mathlib right now is kind of tricky because we are in the middle of porting the entire library to lean 4. I would encourage you to work on standalone projects (like your Mersenne project, which is a great way to get into Lean) and just formalise what the heck you want, e.g. just do Pell -- who cares if someone else did Pell. Do it, add it to the Mersenne stuff, write a little write-up about it and stick it online. This will buy the community some time to get the port done ;-)</p>",
