I'm trying to write statements about the (anti)dual space of <code>n → ℂ</code> consisting of antilinear maps from <code>n → ℂ</code> to <code>ℂ</code>. For example, a sesquilinear form defines for every element <code>x : n → ℂ</code> a (anti)dual <code>⟪x,⬝⟫</code>, so that the (anti)dual of a map may be identified with the conjugate transpose of the corresponding matrix. A set of theorems may then be stated for the antidual space similar to those for <code>module.dual</code>, <code>basis.dual_basis</code>, and <code>linear_map.dual_map</code>. Or would that be redundant?</p>",

In the later case all the stuff that got implemented is in <code>linear_algebra/sesquilinear_form</code> and <code>linear_algebra/bilinear_maps</code>,<br>\nthe issue for <code>bilin_form</code> is just that the file is extremely large and is used in quite a lot of places.</p>",
