While this is justified in the mathematical context, it is much more confusing for the CS context of the stdlib (at least in my view). As such, I think it would be a good idea to rename this folder to something more general (like <code>Meta</code>, <code>Lang</code>, or <code>Elab</code>) and/or split the folder into many (e.g., <code>Tactic</code>, <code>Command</code>, <code>DSL</code>, etc.) as stdlib is likely to have an even larger variety of metaprogramming utilities than mathlib.</p>",
