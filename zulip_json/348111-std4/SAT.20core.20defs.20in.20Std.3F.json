So realistically the library would need to include something like <code>PersistentCnf</code> and <code>Cnf</code>, like <code>List</code> vs <code>Array</code>.

A data structure that represents the LLVM/MLIR syntax is surely an improvement over a string, but I'd argue not a terribly big one. If we'd want some sort of semantic representation of the LLVM/MLIR code to be able to e.g. typecheck some of the code, which I think we'd need for your points (a) and (b) perhaps above, although I don't fully understand those. For your point (c) a semantic embedding sounds indispensable, whereas for (d) this probably would already be very useful just to be able to code generate something opaque.</p>",
