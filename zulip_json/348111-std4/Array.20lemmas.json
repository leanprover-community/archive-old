But other than that, I'm having a hard time comparing the list of List (haha <span aria-label=\"neutral\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f610\" role=\"img\" title=\"neutral\">:neutral:</span>) lemmas that are not known for Array).</p>\n<p>It'd be nice to collect a list of big targets that we should aim for to get feature parity between arrays and lists, and I'd be curious to see what other results people would like to see. After a couple days I'll compile the stuff from this thread and make an issue in <code>std4</code> to give myself/others goals to work towards.</p>",
