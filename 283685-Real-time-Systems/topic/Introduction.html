<p>With Lean 4 focused on being a good programming language, I have an aspirational goal of being able to use Lean 4 in more systems oriented programs.   This channel is to discuss that.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110994">@Joe Hendrix</span>  From my understanding, systems programming and real-time systems are two <em>very</em> different fields. How do <em>you</em> view the cross-over between the two and how exactly does this channel fit in?</p>

<p>I'm not sure if there is a formal definitions, but personally view real time systems programming is an subtype of systems programming.  Sometimes people might refer to systems programming as writing an operating system or writing an application somehow tied to a system.</p>
<p>I certainly don't have any objection to making the channel broader if there are non-realtime systems programing that people are actually doing.  The  continuation of the Lean robotics IR&amp;D at Galois got put on pause.</p>
