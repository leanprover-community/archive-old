<p>Hi all. I am a Berkeley undergraduate working on a research project in lean. Prof. Wesley Holliday referred me to your group to learn more about lean, and in attending one of your meetings I received some great advice. </p>
<p>I've reached a design problem in my research relating to the lean type system (<a href="#narrow/stream/217875-Is-there.20code.20for.20X.3F/topic/Generic.20Types/near/222204604">here is a link to my related question</a>) and I was wondering if any of you would be willing to give me some advice. My understanding of type classes and type parameters is not at the level to properly be able to design this critical part of the work. If any of you are available to talk to me about this or have any ideas, please let me know. I'm greatly appreciative of your time. Thanks.</p>

<p>You're definitely welcome to come to the Friday meeting again any week (it's still happening regularly). Also, I tried answering the question you linked to</p>

<p>Oh! I just presumed it had stopped with the semester. I'll definitely continue to join in.</p>
