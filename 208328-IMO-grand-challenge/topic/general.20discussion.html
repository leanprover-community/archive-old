<li>Other domains.<br>
It is well known that IMO problems are of four categories: "Geometry / Algebra / Number Theory / Combinatorics" (a friend of mine once came with a nice comparison to "Imagination / Computation / Knowledge / Thinking" :-) ). The problem statements are relatively monotonous inside a single domain unless there is a combinatorial flavour. The most difficult problems from both formalisation perspective and the problem solving perspective are imho problems from Combinatorial Geometry. I am for example curious about the formalisation of the windmill problem (2011-2, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M64HUIJFTZM" target="_blank" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M64HUIJFTZM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M64HUIJFTZM</a>).</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I am not concerned that formalizing the problem statement, or formalizing the solution would be impossible, I just find it somewhat challenging, so I would like to see it. Of course, if an automated system (not designed for solving this particular problem) could find a solution of it, I would be super-impressed. However, I feel the following issue of the formalization of the problem statement. There are some facts about the problem that are so obvious (but really nontrivial to formally proof) that it is unclear whether they are actually a part of the problem statement, or a part of the solution. I mean for example "given any initial line, there is exactly one windmill process".</p>

<p>It makes sense. Note that although there is no public document for the IMO marking scheme, the judges prepare it and agree on the marking scheme before checking the solutions.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="133339">@Miroslav Olšák</span> I agree that these are big challenges. One approach might be to have a DSL for geometric processes, and then to encode the windmill process as a program in the DSL. </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>windmill(S, s, l) =
  while true:
    l \gets rotateUntil(l, s, CLOCK_WISE, fun l =&gt; exists s&#39; \in S, s \neq s&#39; /\ on(s&#39;, l))
    s \gets choose({s&#39; \in S : s&#39; \neq s /\ on(s&#39;, l)})
</pre></div>


<p>Here it would be provable that the <code>{s' \in S : ...}</code> set always has exactly one element (since by assumption |S| &gt; 1 and no three points are collinear) and thus the process is deterministic. The key insight required to solve the problem could then be cast as discovering an invariant of the program.</p>
<p>I am not sure what kind of semantics such a hypothetical DSL would warrant, probably operational, and bottoming out into some geometric object parameterized by time. I am also not sure whether we would have already had such abstractions before the windmill year, or whether the abstractions we can build now will be good enough for future problems.</p>

<p>Well, putting a human into the loop is fine, it just rather postpones the problem than solves it (but it may be a good thing to postpone it). I also like the idea of whitelist of allowed operations for every individual problem where the problems available so far would help us prepare templates for such whitelists. But if a problem requiring something more complex emerged, we could simply modify the whitelist to allow what is necessary without providing much hints (it is actually also putting a human to the loop but to another place).</p>

<p>By the way, the comments teaching me how to use Zulip look irrelevant from the general perspective. I suggest using rather private messages next time. By the way, can I delete at least my comments of regarding Zulip?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="133339">@Miroslav Olšák</span> I'm very sorry my message may have sounded a bit aggressive. I'm sure Daniel and the whole grand-challenge team is very happy to read your contributions. Experience on this forum suggests things are a bit easier if we somehow try to separate topics, but there are plenty of counterexamples. So please don't let that issue prevent you from contributing.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="230999">@Daniel Selsam</span> I am trying to understand the specifications we are trying to pin down in this community. Inspired by a question on the Intermediate Langauge stream referencing HOList and worrying about portability of the competition if things get tied down to lean, is the goal of the project also to re-implement something like HOList? How is it going to be different? </p>
<p>From the comment on that thread/stream it seems that re-implementing HOList would be a pain (I wish I understood why), but I think it would be important to understand the difference and planning things out before going out and re-implementing a complicated system like HOList. What are your thoughts?</p>

<p>It is not hard to interface with ML systems. Lean has a tactic framework, with excellent meta-programming support, and also a foreign function interface.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="246156">@Brando Miranda</span> I can try to address (narrowly) what I think would need to happen to reimplement HOList in Lean.  I know at least one person here is working on it.  I don’t know what progress they have made.  I’m probably the one who said this  a “pain”.  I should probably backtrack and say it is doable with a good amount of engineering work, and I hope someone builds it!  As I think you have an ML background, I won’t try to cover up the ML terminology.</p>

<p>As I see it, the HOList projects have the following parts that would need to be reimplemented:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>A list of theorems</em> For both training and testing, one needs a list of theorems (and the full context in some nicely parsable form) to train on.</li>
<li><em>Proof recording (optional)</em> If one wants to do supervised learning, then one needs a list of proofs as well to train on.  These proofs will contain the theorem to prove (with the context) as well as the various tactics which have been applied along with their arguments.  This needs to be at some intermediate level which records the name of the tactic and the arguments (so at a higher level than type theory), but probably not at the level of the raw lean code.  I’ve heard from some in the Lean community that the tactic environment could be hacked to provide this information, but I don’t know that it has ever been done.  HOL Light has some advantages here.  It has a simpler tactic framework (I think), it is a larger library (more training data), it is written by one person mostly (so is more uniform), and HOL Light only uses tactics (whereas Lean uses a mixture of tactics and the type theoretic framework).  However, the ASTactic (CogGym) and ProverBot9001 projects also used proof recording for Coq.</li>
<li><em>An interactive environment</em> If one wants to do reinforcement learning and/or tree search, one needs to be able to quickly interact with the system.  For tree search, given a particular state, one needs to be able to try possible tactics, see what the results are and back track if needed (using for example beam search).  Also, for reinforcement learning, one needs to be able to try out a very large number of scenarios (in this case theorems, either real or synthetic, to prove).  This necessitates an even faster back-and-forth between the agent and the system.  Google rewrote HOL Light in C++ for this purpose.  (The various Coq ML projects don’t use reinforcement learning.)</li>
<li><em>A system for scoring tactics and tactic arguments</em>  Scoring the tactics can be done as a probability distribution over the tactics (computed by a neural network), but scoring the arguments to these tactics can be a bit more tricky because of the large number of possibilities.  HOList has one system for doing this.  The two Coq projects have another system.  I don’t know if either is readily adaptable to Lean.</li>
<li><em>Access to neural networks and computer power for training and evaluation</em> The agent will have to compute tactic and argument scores via (graph?) neural networks.  Therefore, it needs access to TensorFlow or PyTorch and a distributed computing system.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some further comments.  One doesn’t need proof recording.  Instead one can train solely with theorem statements and reinforcement learning.  Conversely, if one doesn’t use reinforcement learning, then one doesn’t need as much speed in the interactive environment.  Also, the tree search agent could live inside Lean (as a tactic) making FFI calls to TensorFlow, say.  Alternately it could have the agent in Python or C++.  Then it would have to guide Lean from the outside.  I don’t know which is better.</p>

<p>Are you saying google wrote HOL Light (the entire Theorm prover, idk if that is a lot of work or not but it sounds like it) only so that they could do RL on HOL Light? (trying to repeat it back to you to make sure I got it).</p>
<p>On a very related note, does that mean for someone to re-implement HOList to make LeanList we would need to re-implement Lean in a language that allows for high performance/speed to do RL?</p>
<p>I think the fundamental thing I don't understand is how to do  the IMO-grand-challenge without a system like HOList built already. Why wouldn't that need to be a pre-requisite?</p>

<p>I don't know the answer to that, but this FFI business is relevant because it means it is actually viable to build your ML system in Lean, which gives you direct access to the Lean tactic state and so on as well. For other theorem provers, you'd want to use a different programming language and then you have the problem of importing/exporting data like the tactic state. (Although I'm not sure why you couldn't just use OCaml as the host language for the theorem provers written in it.)</p>

<p>I think one would need the following in a project like this.  </p>
<ul>
<li>A reinforcement learning master algorithm which decides which problems to try to attempt, tells the agent to try to solve them, records the results, and uses these results to train the neural network.  This would also probably be a heavily parallelized application.</li>
<li>A search algorithm which tries to solve a particular problem (repeatedly querying a neural network as an oracle).</li>
<li>The part which actually runs the neural network.  (And for speed it probably needs to batch up calls to the neural network and send them together to make efficient use of the GPU.</li>
<li>The part which trains the neural network.</li>

<p>I think the last two need to be in Python or C++.  The tree search agent could be in Lean with FFI to the part which calls the network, but I don't know how well a purely functional language  does with (non-depth-first) tree search.

<p>I thought a bit more about tree search algorithms in Lean.  In general, reasonably efficient search algorithms can be implemented with maps (hash tables or other lookup data structures) and priority queues (heaps).  I know Lean 3 doesn't have a priority queue/heap but I found a good one in the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Purely-Functional-Data-Structures-Okasaki/dp/0521663504" target="_blank" title="https://www.amazon.com/Purely-Functional-Data-Structures-Okasaki/dp/0521663504">Purely Functional Data Structures</a>.  A few weeks ago I tried implementing both their BinomialHeap and SplayHeap in Lean.  The SplayHeap is about an order of magnitude faster than the Binomial Heap and can do heap sort in Lean as fast as Lean's merge sort.  (I noticed Lean 4 implements BinomialHeaps in the base library, and I wonder if SplayHeaps would be better.)  So maybe if Lean is decked out with the fastest purely functional fastest data structures (or uses FFI to call non-functional C++ data structures), then it wouldn't be a large bottleneck to have the search agent live in Lean.  Then one would have a powerful fast search tactic in Lean (which could be guided by FFI calls to a pre-trained neural network).</p>

<p>What worries me is the "pre-trained" neural net (NN) part. I think if Lean is going to be used besides just a theorem prover, it should allow for training of the NN. Also, another thing to consider is that its going to be hard for people to adopt the challenge or ITP Lean environment/dataset if it all lives in a new programming language that is not "standard" like python. I dont think its going to be able to kick off like the famous large-scale computer vision competition/dataset (ImageNet). It has to be taken into account that if every competitor is forced to learn a new programming paradigm (like functional programming (fp)), note this isn't only a new programming language, it might take some time to people really use it (or perhaps people won't). It takes some time to get good at a new programming language, specially if its a new paradigm. Having things in Python imho will make any ITP challenge more likely to thrive.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="246156">@Brando Miranda</span> I think in some sense one needs both (to (1) be able to run a search algorithm inside Lean with a NN and (2) guide Lean from the outside in something like Python).  Setting aside the IMO challenge and just thinking about improving Lean, from the perspective of a Lean user, they want whatever system one is building to be usable in Lean.  And this is really a problem with the other tools out there.  I don't know if any of the AI/ITP systems currently out there are usable and useful to the practitioners of that ITP system.  However, if Lean had a HOList-like tactic called <code>lean_ist</code> (which admittedly would involve some additional setup), then they could write <code>by lean_ist</code>.  The system would behave similar to the <code>library_search</code> tactic, outputting a proof which can be pasted into Lean.</p>

<p>On the flip side, something that inhibits the growth of these AI for ITP systems is that it is a major engineering feat to link your AI library to your theorem prover (and just as large of a feat to learn the intricacies of the logic).  One thing that has really increased neural network research progress has been environments which are easy to spin up and play with.  These "gym" environments allow you apply the same training algorithm to many different problems which have the same interface.  I think a very useful research project would be the following:  Go through the other AI for theorem proving projects out there, and find a common gym-like interface for interactive theorem provers and related systems, including tableau calculus, constraint solvers, QBF solvers, SMT solvers with tactics, non-classical proof systems.  (I can point one to over a dozen papers, each in a separate system.)   As far as I see they have the following uniform framework:</p>
<ul>
<li>A term and formula language</li>
<li>A local goal state: What one is trying to prove at the moment (as an ordered list of formulas in some formal language)</li>
<li>Premise List: all the possible previously proven theorem statements one could use (which needs to be significantly narrowed down in a process called “premise selection”)</li>
<li>Tactics or inference rules: a fixed finite set of rules one can apply to ones current goal state</li>
<li>Tactic parameters: the possible parameters that can be added to the above tactics.  (This is by far the most inconsistent and flexible part of the framework.  These parameters can include numbers, terms, and premises from the premise list.)</li>
<li>a training and test set: formulas to prove (and possibly proofs for supervised learning)</li>
<li>application: one needs to be able to quickly apply a rule/tactic</li>
<li>persistence/backtracking: So that any tree search algorithm can be applied, one needs a notion of backtracking.  (Practically, this means that states need to be persistent.  If one applies a tactic it creates a new state, without changing the old state.  Think immutable data structures.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now not all systems use all of the above.  A simple logical system, e.g. QBFs, may not use premise selection or tactic parameters.   A fully automatic system (e.g. an ATP like E-prover) may only have one tactic (solve) and the challenge is just premise selection.  Some systems also don’t have the backtracking, but that severely limits how effectively one can search.</p>

<p>Now HOList has basically created a system like this in DeepHOL (although not very well documented) which they make easier to use by burying it in a docker container, so it just becomes a black box (a gym).  I also think they had to do a lot of work to make the persistence/backtracking thing work, but that is also not documented well.  I think the CoqGym and GamePad systems also try to do something similar for Coq.  In some systems like MetaMath, it shouldn’t be terribly hard to just rewrite the logic to make such an environment.  <strong>The question is, can Lean be abstracted into a system like this which is fast (and more importantly, it satisfies the persistence/backtracking requirement).</strong></p>

<p>Getting back to the IMO challenge, I feel the goal is different than developing a training algorithm for an arbitrary neural theorem prover.  However, I agree that it isn’t clear if this project will attract those outside of the established Lean community or Microsoft Research because of the barrier to entry.  However, you are here @Brando, so maybe it is working. :)</p>

<p>lean has always had a backtracking tactic state</p>

<p>speed might be an issue, but possibly lean 4 has solved that problem</p>

<p>But is it useable from the outside.  Could it be wrapped in a black box with a set number of tactics?  (So from the outside it is just like a chess board with a set number of possible moves?)</p>

<p>You can do it with lean --server but there is far too much overhead involved</p>
