<p>Hey, there's a couple papers on openreview for ICLR 2021 that seem relevant to the task of solving IMO problems in Lean that I thought people might be interested in.</p>
<p>Learning Axioms to Compute Verifiable Symbolic Expression Equivalence Proofs Using Graph-to-Sequence Networks - <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=PkqwRo2wjuW">https://openreview.net/forum?id=PkqwRo2wjuW</a><br>
This is learning a map from a pair of trees of symbols to a sequence of rewrite rules that can transform one of the trees into the other. This seems promising, like it could be analogous to a simplification of a Lean formula. Or you could use the probabilities for the first part of the sequence as input into a nondeterministic tactic.</p>
<p>Do Transformers Understand Polynomial Simplification? - <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=yZkF6xqhfQ">https://openreview.net/forum?id=yZkF6xqhfQ</a><br>
The answer here seems to be roughly, "no". My reading is, the authors are basically trying to take an existing polynomial-simplification algorithm and use it to train a transformer to do the same thing, and it doesn't quite work. Not entirely surprising since I believe simpler tasks like long division also cannot be packed into a transfer. But this is useful in terms of the limitations of an AI component of a mathematical process.</p>

<p>Thanks for the summaries!  If you want to add more details about these papers or other ICLR papers, I'd love to see them and discuss them more.  I often post summaries of papers on the <a class="stream" data-stream-id="219941" href="/#narrow/stream/219941-Machine-Learning-for-Theorem-Proving">#Machine Learning for Theorem Proving</a> stream, which has readership both in and outside of the Lean community.  (For example, it is where a lot of HOList questions get fielded.)  It's a lot of work to read and understand a paper so I'm always happy if others want to contribute their insights.</p>
