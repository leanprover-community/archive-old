<p>I was about to write you should hire Reid but, from the website, I see your AI already figured that out. Is the team meant to help encoding IMO problem only, or do they also actively participate in solving the challenge?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="210574">@Patrick Massot</span> Hi Patrick. We may create some kind of official organization in the future that would give this list a precise semantics, but for now, it is just a list of people who think it is a productive grand challenge, and who will work with us on developing the rules and necessary background tools for the competition. We hope that there will be many different teams working on different approaches to solving the grand challenge, and we would like representatives of all of the teams to be part of the IMO-grand-challenge community.</p>
