<p>I looked through the IMO problems looking for ones that would be easy to formalize. At first I thought inequalities might be a good place to focus on, but there really aren't as many as I expected. Number theory seems a bit easier. Maybe I'll try formalizing one up tomorrow. Also, for what's it's worth, I suspect that 1979 problem 1 will be the easiest IMO problem for a Lean-based prover to automatically solve:</p>

<p>1979 problem 1: if p and q are natural numbers such that p/q = 1 - (1/2) + (1/3) - (1/4) + ... + (1/1319), prove that p is divisible by 1979.</p>

<p>The art of this question is of course to prove the result without doing the computation! pari-gp does the sum instantly (unformalised, of course). This is one of those questions where you can read the solution and say "yeah, I guess that's pretty simple", but actually finding it is tough because 1319 is a bit random.</p>

<p>fortunately, the computer is not required to do it the "artful" way ;-) there's just a teeny bit of extra work on top of the brute force to come to the "p is divisible by 1979" conclusion. still, we don't actually have a solver that will solve this whole problem today, right? so it seems like a relatively simple one that should get cracked early</p>

<p>Well, this problem in particular is "only" human infeasible to calculate, but it is quite easy to make it also computer-infeasible, just replace the 1979 by a significantly higher prime number, and 1319 by the appropriate (p+1)*2/3-1.</p>

<p>By the way, the problem reminds me of a discussion we had some time ago -- since p,q are natural numbers, p/q is a natural number as well, right? :-)</p>

<p>I believe technically it's computer-infeasible right now - a computer can calculate the sum, but AFAIK there is nothing that would go from the entire problem statement, to concluding that the sum needs to be calculated, to deducing that p must be divisible by 1979</p>

<p>There are three IMO problems in the mathlib archive, fewer than I thought. I think it might be nice for someone to create and maintain an IMO problem repository, separate from mathlib. We have CI scripts and ways to publicize external projects now. The benefits of an external project are that it can have its own style and doc standards and avoid the overhead of the mathlib PR/review process.</p>

<p>Any Olympiad problems, the more the merrier. We can add directories e.g. <code>src/putnam</code> and <code>src/imc</code>.</p>

<p>To be clear, I wasn't trying to speak for the mathlib maintainers when I suggested this, just my own opinion. But I think IMO problems are a perfect thing to put in their own repo. This kind of thing deserves its own visibility, its own review process, its own style and documentation guidelines. To me it seems better to let it grow on its own then force it through the mathlib bottleneck.</p>

<p>If we do decide to use a separate repository (that covers all olympiads) I can add my British MO solutions there (but the geometry one still requires me to get more pieces into mathlib first). As even if IMO problems are suitable for the mathlib archive, maybe the scope of the mathlib archive shouldn't be extended to cover the much greater number of problems from olympiads all over the world.</p>

<p>Before I add any of my British MO solutions, do people have comments on whether it would be appropriate to add a definition of <code>odd</code> (for <code>nat</code> and <code>int</code>) to mathlib, which <code>simp</code> would rewrite to <code>춻 even</code>, to allow problem statements using "odd" to be expressed more literally?

<p>(I think this ship has sailed, but my preference would have been to follow a suggestion I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="260507">@Heather Macbeth</span> made --- that we should continue to add IMO problems to mathlib, but to think of this as an incubation period, with the intention that once we have about ~100 IMO problems formalised, we will break them out into a separate repository. After this period we can be reasonably confident that the background mathematics to "do the IMO" is largely in mathlib, so we're at less risk from losing good material. In the meantime perhaps we could appoint an IMO-specific maintainer --- e.g. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="230999">@Daniel Selsam</span> --- with the intention that they would also help organise the transition out of incubation.)</p>

<p>(I think this ship has sailed, but my preference would have been to follow a suggestion I think <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="260507">Heather Macbeth</span> made --- that we should continue to add IMO problems to mathlib, but to think of this as an incubation period, with the intention that once we have about ~100 IMO problems formalised, we will break them out into a separate repository. After this period we can be reasonably confident that the background mathematics to "do the IMO" is largely in mathlib, so we're at less risk from losing good material. In the meantime perhaps we could appoint an IMO-specific maintainer --- e.g. <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="230999">Daniel Selsam</span> --- with the intention that they would also help organise the transition out of incubation.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You could easily do 100 IMO problems without having much of the background mathematics needed to do problems involving geometry or graph theory (the weakest areas of IMO mathematics in mathlib at present).</p>

<p>I know there's various graph theory stuff on branches. I'd like to see more PRs of that work so none of it lives on a branch for too long. At present, it would be awkward to formalise solutions of 2019 problem 3 or 2020 problem 3 without duplicating such not-on-master graph theory work (e.g. about connected graphs / connected components). If we try to keep things so that almost all graph theory work is on master, it's easier for problem solutions to build on it (and thus to add lemmas to the graph theory in mathlib when they are found to be useful for problems).</p>

<p>I think there's still a spread of opinion about what belongs in mathlib. I think Rob very correctly wants us to work out how to do development across multiple repositories. He has set up a nice scheme for doing cross-project CI, and we really should try it out (more). With the IMO work having some momentum now, and an obvious lead (i.e. you) it seems like a good candidate.</p>

<p>The IMO Grand Challenge may eventually need some way to mark up the parts of a problem that a solver must fill in, but I'm not even sure of that. (A solver could be presented with a series of definitions, where those defined to <code>sorry</code> must be filled in. If such a definition has a non-<code>Prop</code> type, it must be filled in with a human-acceptable witness for a "determine" problem, while if it has a <code>Prop</code> type (which may reference the non-<code>Prop</code> definitions, for the term proving the witness has the desired property) there are no such requirements on the term.) Beyond that, I'd expect any lemma or definition that's generic mathematics rather than specific to one problem to go in mathlib.</p>

<p>So, I'm happy either way, as I haven't done more than trivial reviewing of IMO problem PRs and don't plan to in the future. But we've been having this discussion about external projects for a year and a half now. I guess my question is, if not now, then when? Yes, there's friction splitting a project off, but we won't find tools or workflows to reduce that friction unless we try. And I stand by what I wrote above (and agree with Daniel's additions) that IMO problems are a perfect case for a separate project.</p>

<p>I don't think there's tension between an IMO repo and mathlib -- the IMO repo depends on mathlib being maintained and growing, and from the mathlib side, it's cool to see fun problems being formalized using the library, not to mention future automation that could come from it. There's plenty of incentive on both sides to get the mathlib-appropriate material into mathlib.</p>

<p>My view: I'm not very concerned with whether a separate repository is used or not, as long as we don't have <code>for_mathlib</code> and have a strong policy to put relevant definitions and lemmas in mathlib proper before using them in an olympiad solution on master. If the scope grows beyond the 368 past IMO problems to a formal version of the AoPS contests collection with thousands of problems from different competitions, that probably belongs outside mathlib, but even then it could reasonably incubate in the mathlib archive for a while until big enough.</p>

<p>Most algebra and number theory problems and many combinatorics problems could probably be formalised now with at most a few small definitions and lemmas arising that are appropriate for mathlib. Geometry and combinatorial geometry are more likely to need hundreds or thousands of lines of preliminaries PRed to mathlib first, especially when a more literal geometrical interpretation is taken of combinatorial geometry problems that means there are lots of trivial-to-humans preliminaries to formalise first. (A good example might be IMO 2004 problem 3. Taken as a problem about <code>fin m 칑 fin n</code>, there would be no particular obstruction to formalising it. Taking it literally as a geometrical problem, you also have to prove that the tiles are all aligned with the grid of squares in the rectangle containing them (obvious to humans) in order to reduce it to a combinatorics problem. I can come up with various suitably general statements about tilings (not just in the plane) that imply this, but that would involve a large amount of work on formalising things about tilings in mathlib before we get to the point of being able to reduce the geometrical problem to a combinatorial one.)</p>

I apologize for any confusion or complication caused by my rash repository-creation. Let's continue to incubate the IMO problems in mathlib for now. Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>At this stage, almost every new IMO problem will require new lemmas, and most mathlibbers seem interested in getting most of these lemmas into mathlib. Almost every PR would need to be a double PR.</li>
<li>The goal right now is less about accumulating IMO problems and prototyping automation, and more about using it as an exercise to fill in important gaps in mathlib.</li>
<li>I prefer not to take a leadership role with the IMO formalizations until Lean4 is in place and we can co-develop the formalizations with the automation.</li>
<li>We can easily port to a separate repository in the future, e.g. once most new problems do not require significant for-mathlib components, and when we can write automation in Lean4.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are 380 past IMO problems and only 30 in the mathlib archive plus 4 more with open PRs; anything not on either of those lists probably hasn't been done yet. Most algebra and number theory problems should be accessible (provided you start with a good mathematical understanding of the informal solution you are trying to formalize, as is always important for formalizing anything), most geometry will be inaccessible because of missing API in mathlib (I'm working towards the API needed for IMO 2019 Q2) and accessibility of combinatorics problems will vary. Note archive/imo/README.md: much of the benefit of such formalizations comes from the resulting additions to mathlib proper, whenever they suggest some missing piece of more generally applicable API.</p>

<p>I have a maximalist view of what's appropriate for mathlib right now - anything adding definitions or proving results that can reasonably be considered known mathematics from the literature should by default be appropriate for mathlib or the mathlib archive (the choice depending on how likely other results are to build on the definitions and results in question), once up to mathlib quality standards - and "mathematics" here broadly covers those mathematical sciences where formalization makes sense (including for software verification). That includes all IMO problems for the mathlib archive.</p>

<p>For geometry, even humans solve the problem by relying on the diagram. Unordered geometry helps with reducing case analysis but not a guarantee. I don't see much value from similar proofs for different cases (e.g.C is inside or outside segment AB) For the IMO grand challenge, wouldn't it make sense to, as 1st goal, relax geometry problems to "Given a problem description and  an accurate diagram (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02590">Krueger 2021</a>), solve it". So now facts like "AB = AC  + CB" or "AB = AC - CB" (similar for angle algebra), ... will be taken from the diagram and used as part of the proof (just like how humans do it).</p>

<p>I don't see any reason to treat geometry differently from other subject areas in IMO Grand Challenge rules - the formal statement should accurately correspond to the informal one, and then it's up to the AI writing the formal proof to fill in all the trivialities that could be skipped over in an informal proof - just as in other subject areas. Of course an AI might well draw a diagram internally and use that to work out conjectures for intermediate steps to prove.</p>
<p>It does seem that when the informal proof is straightforward, proving the trivialities required to apply the formal lemmas corresponding to the steps of the informal proof can actually take up most of the formal proof - that's what I'm finding as I move from building up API anticipated to be needed for IMO 2019 Q2 to actually filling out the formal proof of the problem itself.</p>

<p>In terms of formalizing the problem I completely agree. </p>
<p>On the other hand, I want to understand more what is considered an acceptable "solution" coming from an actual IMO human contestant. When seeing point C lying in between A and B, would it make sense for an IMO contestant to (1) use "AB = AC + CB", or do they have to (2) prove that C is indeed in between A and B, or (3) choose a different path that does not involve such algebra? </p>
<p>My understanding is that it has to be either (2) - which sometimes can be hard and/or tedious, or (1) with additional case analysis where C is not in between AB. Further, if (1) is done without extra cases, how would judges go about evaluating such solutions?</p>
<p>One example I have in mind is<br>
![img](<a href="https://imgur.com/a/RzpLBdr">https://imgur.com/a/RzpLBdr</a>)</p>
<p>Here what to prove is, for example, F being in between B and C; So we need to prove the projection of the intersection of two internal bisectors lies inside the triangle's side. I suppose this is what you mean by:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It does seem that when the informal proof is straightforward, <strong>proving the trivialities</strong> required to apply the formal lemmas corresponding to the steps of the informal proof can actually take up most of the formal proof.</p>

<p>Does forcing the AI going through this make the problem significantly harder than it is for a human? If so, lowering the bar to human-level seems like a reasonable intermediate goal regarding "IMO grand AI challenge". Of course, if we can do away with this and AI can go all the way then this will be a distraction, but is it?</p>

<p>Typically recent IMO geometry problems will include e.g. betweenness conditions in the problem statement to avoid contestants needing to deal with multiple configurations, and contestants won't be expected to prove e.g. a betweenness property that is obvious from a diagram of the one permitted configuration.</p>
<p>Of course a contestant's solution might introduce its own configuration dependence. I'm formalising solution 1 to IMO 2019 Q2, but solution 2 involves a case distinction on whether two lines are parallel, and contestants using that approach <em>did</em> have to deal with both cases (rather than just using the intersection point of those lines and ignoring or not noticing the case where they are parallel) to get full marks.</p>
<p>Or sometimes the use of configuration information is nontrivial and important to the problem in some way. E.g. IMO 2002 problem 2, where the angle condition was needed to get the incentre rather than the excentre and failing to say anything about the use of that condition lost a mark.</p>
<p>In the example you mention, "an intouch point is in the interior of a face" (for a general simplex, not just the two-dimensional case) seems like a result appropriate for mathlib proper (just as in any area of mathematics, there are many trivial lemmas to put in mathlib to get a good API).</p>
<p>The IMO Grand Challenge being F2F does indeed make some things harder than for humans, but I don't think requiring geometrical trivialities to be justified is any different from requiring trivialities in other subject areas to be justified in the F2F IMO Grand Challenge.</p>
<p>An I2I version (AI receives the paper in up to three human languages, as provided to contestants, writes an informal solution and has it graded by coordinators familiar with the mark scheme and how it was applied in coordination of human solutions) would be perfectly reasonable - any AI that can achieve enough points in that (on a future IMO, using a version of the AI from before contestants started sitting that IMO's papers) to reach the gold medal boundary for that IMO would have made a very major achievement in AI.</p>
<p>But F2F has obvious advantages for people developing such an AI, that may well outweigh needing to prove trivialities (which it might well be possible to write tactics to prove). The mark schemes aren't generally public and aren't systematically collected anywhere. If you find willing coordinators from past IMOs to grade I2I attempts, the number of attempts they can grade is limited, whereas an F2F AI can have millions of attempts graded automatically, as well as getting instant feedback while working on a problem about what is or isn't a valid argument. You still need conventions about how to translate the informal problem to the formal one, but those can be written in a very detailed and objective way (and conventions for other proof assistants could be written and agreed to be equivalent to the Lean ones in the sense of giving the AI the same information).</p>

<p>I would say the scalable way to deal with this kind of case analysis is to remember the order in which you compare segments. E.g. when you say CJ = KC, what you really mean is the one bit stronger statement that CJ maps to (a translate of) KC after reclection in HC. I don't know any situation where one still has to do a case analysis <em>after</em> working with directed things in this way (it somehow wouldn't make sense -- when proving a polynomial identity, you never say "if x &lt; 0, then ... else ..."). Students often write arguments with undirected angles where there's some case analysis missing that becomes unnecessary using directed angles. People have different ideas about how to mark such scripts, but many seem to agree it would be unfair to punish students for not knowing about directed angles. But I do think  an AI solver should understand this sort of thing</p>
