<p>A bunch of theorems in that file are true for infinite groups if you define the order of an element of infinite order to be 0. I'm surprised that this was not the convention chosen by Johannes.</p>

<p>Even more are true if you use <code>fincard</code> (the cardinal of an infinite set being 0)</p>

<p>I recently looked at this issue and was confused as to why the order of an element is only defined for finite groups. This seems like it wouldn't scale well in the future.</p>

<p>One issue is that nat is much easier to work with than enat (:= <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="double-struck">N</mi><mo>∪</mo><mo stretchy="false">{</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi><mo stretchy="false">}</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68889em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">N</span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;"></span><span class="mbin">∪</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">{</span><span class="mord">∞</span><span class="mclose">}</span></span></span></span>), and lean likes total functions. The rather esoteric solution of letting elements of infinite order have order 0 looks weird to mathematicians but actually works really nicely, and this is because a conceptual way of thinking about the order of g is the kernel of the map from Z to G sending 1 to g; this kernel has a unique nonnegative generator which one could define to be the order.</p>

<p>Another question I had regarding this issue was why the characteristic of a ring is not defined as the order of 1? If one defined the order here as zero if infinite, then this would also agree with characteristic 0.</p>

<p>I agree that this would be a nice way to do it! Perhaps the answer is simply that it was done another way and we now have an API which works, so why change it? It doesn't really matter what the definitions are as long as the API is there.</p>
