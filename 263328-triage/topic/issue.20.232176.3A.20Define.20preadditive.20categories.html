<p>Preadditive categories are defined in <code>category_theory.preadditive.default</code> so I'm guessing we can close this one.</p>

<p>My understanding is that the current definition is just a "temporary" one while we wait for enriched categories</p>

<p>I'm not sure how much progress there has been towards enriched categories. There is <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/enriched_reprise">branch#enriched_reprise</a> which had some recent commits but I don't know what it does.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> would be most helpful here, but my understanding from the last time I asked him was that there's a bunch of tricky questions to ask about how to go about setting up definitions in order to make them useful for concrete applications; and perhaps the right approach for the moment is to consider concrete enriched categories, ie ones where the hom-sets are sets with some extra structure (eg additive groups) rather than replacing hom-sets with objects from any monoidal category</p>

<p>Quoting from him so as to save him some typing:<br>
"We could just enrich over an arbitrary monoidal category V (not necessarily concrete), and then do base change along any lax monoidal functor, and then set up the equivance between Type-enriched categories and ordinary categories.  This is certainly the most "principled" approach. But I don't think it helps anyone who just wants to be able to multiply their morphisms by scalars (and know their functors commute with scalar multiplication, etc, etc"</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/enriched_reprise">branch#enriched_reprise</a> seemed like a promising start on <code>V</code>-enriched categories in the special case where the <code>V</code> is a concrete category <em>and moreover</em> is built using <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/bundled_hom/src">src#bundled_hom</a>. While this works great for <code>V = Group</code> or <code>V = AddCommGroup</code>, it wouldn't work for <code>V = Module R</code>.</p>

<p>I'm not sure it's useful to have a setup where there is a different incantation to talk about an <code>AddCommGroup</code> enriched category and a <code>Module R</code> enriched category. :-(</p>

<p>In any case I think there's going to be a certain amount of boilerplate for each different value of <code>V</code>(e.g. we can't set up instances which a polymorphic in the typeclass, so at the very least we're going to have to say for each separate <code>V</code> that the hom types actually carry the class).</p>

<p>Given that, it may actually just be fine to go the "principled" route.</p>

<p>I think this would consist of a class <code>enriched_category V C</code>, which is actually disconnected entirely from <code>category</code>, which provides an term of <code>V</code> between each <code>X Y : C</code>, even when <code>V</code> is not concrete. We'd further have change-of-enrichment along a lax monoidal functor <code>V ⥤ W</code>. Finally there would be a typeclass <code>enriched_over V C</code>, which would be a mixin for <code>category C</code>, which would contain the data of a <code>enriched_category V C</code>, along with the equivalences that show that when you transport that one to <code>Type</code> you get the original <code>category C</code>.</p>

<p>(When I say "you get the original category" here, you have to do it pretty gorily: the transported thing will be an <code>enriched_category (Type u) C</code>, and the original thing is a <code>category C</code>, and these are not the same gadget, just <code>equiv</code>.)</p>

<p>The problem with going this route is that you have to build a bunch of theory about <code>enriched_category</code>, before you ever get to find out if the design is actually usable in concrete cases like <code>V = Top</code> or <code>V = Module R</code>...</p>

<p>This doesn't sound like a problem to someone like me who cares more about the theory than the concrete examples :D</p>
