<p>It's most definitely still relevant, and a great guide to what we should be doing.</p>

<p>There sure are lots of todos.<br>
Thanks to Kevin for pointing me here.<br>
I think the base change stuff could definitely get some love now that the fibered products of schemes are on the way.</p>

<p>This is just pure ring theory and probably we have base change of ring morphisms along tensor products (I guess?)</p>

<p>nope, we don't really have that so far. There is a def <code>tensor_product.map</code> or something. But no API.</p>

<p>So what do we need -- pullback of finitely-generated is finitely-generated, pullback of flat is flat etc etc? Shall I try to get a PhD student interested?</p>

<p>Yes. I suppose most of the properties we will need in the near future are already on that list.<br>
Though I think showing that some properties are local will also be helpful.<br>
It would be great if someone works on these stuff.<br>
But I'll probably end up doing them if they are not yet done when we need them.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="439483">@Andrew Yang</span> I'll try to find someone to work on the issue. Can you edit the issue and add the properties which you want to be local and perhaps formalise exactly which form you'd like the lemmas to take?</p>
