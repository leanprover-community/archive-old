<p>I still believe that this is important, but also that it requires a lot of material about schemes (and commutative algebra!) to be really "imminent".</p>

<p>By the way I'm (very slowly) working on flatness -- I decided that it would be easier to develop the theory after we had Tor though, so I'm currently thinking about that. I'm completely happy with having this as a long-term issue, I think it's a fine goal, but of course we are a long way from having either of these things.</p>

<p>Kevin, thanks for working on flatness/tors!</p>
<p>I agree with you that this is a long-term project: I intended it more as a way of testing when a satisfactory level of scheme-theory had been developed, rather than an "easy goal that is within reach"!</p>

<p>The proof of ZMT I know (or rather knew) uses sheaf cohomology, so it somehow feels a very long way away. IIRC Hartshorne argues that the cohomological proof is better than older proofs because it's cleaner. Do you have a feeling as to which of the no doubt many proofs will be easiest to formalise? All of these things would sit very well in the issue.</p>

<p>Yes, I agree that it's time to reclaim algebraic geometry from the category guys!</p>

<p>I am giving 4 lectures on algebraic geometry in Lean in November, and I'm looking for topics. I'm going to do sheaves of modules for the first one (in the naive way, the way which everyone knows will work but everyone complains shouldn't be the way to do it because it will involve duplicating lemmas, an argument which never convinces me)</p>

<p>My suggestion of defining the functor of points in your other thread on AG received an answer from Adam that I still am not sure whether it was a joke or not... <span aria-label="man facepalming" class="emoji emoji-1f926-200d-2642" role="img" title="man facepalming">:man_facepalming:</span></p>

<p>About duplicating lemmas, I started out thinking the same as you: copy-paste is easy.  But refactoring lemmas that are copy-pasted across the library is actually not too pleasant.  So now I try harder to avoid copy pasting...</p>
