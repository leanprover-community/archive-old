<p>I haven't really looked at this in a while - the primary sticking point is that it defines a probability on finsets in a naive way:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="sd">/-- `Prob s P` is the probability that a random element from `s` satisfies the predicate `P`. -/</span>
<span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">Prob</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">α</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span><span class="bp">*</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">finset</span> <span class="n">α</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">P</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">α</span> <span class="bp">→</span> <span class="kt">Prop</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">decidable_pred</span> <span class="n">P</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">ℚ</span> <span class="o">:=</span>
<span class="o">(</span><span class="n">s.filter</span> <span class="n">P</span><span class="o">)</span><span class="bp">.</span><span class="n">card</span> <span class="bp">/</span> <span class="n">s.card</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>which is good enough to state and prove the ballot problem, but not really much else of any interest; and isn't linked to the measure theory library. I was thinking about extending it to non-uniform but finite sample spaces which would be enough to do a big portion of probabilistic combinatorics (in particular probabilistic graph theory) but it basically just was the same as weighted sums and center mass in mathlib already so I pretty quickly stopped. At some point I'd like to get back to this and create API for probabilistic combinatorics, possibly moving <code>finset.center_mass</code> out of <code>analysis/convex/basic</code> and adapting <code>measure_theory/probability_mass_function</code>. The sort of API I have in mind would have a structure <code>finite_probability_space</code> containing a finite sample space and a pmf on it, and functions to express the probability of an event and the expectation of a function on it. One of the important things it would need is a definition of the space <code>G(n,p)</code> of graphs with n vertices and each edge present independently with probability <code>p</code> - obviously this is just the product measure of <code>n choose 2</code> bernoulli variables but it's not obvious to me that you can build the resultant probability space to explicitly have its sample space as graphs on n vertices. Perhaps the people who've thought about measure theory and probability theory in Lean can weigh in?</p>

<p>As a concrete example, let X be the number of triangles in a graph from G(n,p), then I'd like to show that E[X] is <code>(n choose 3) * p^3</code> and the variance of X is <code>&lt;= n^3 p^3 + n^4 p^5</code> (if it matters, specifically <code>(n choose 3) (p^3 - p^6) + (n choose 3) * 3 * (n - 3) * (p^5 - p^6)</code></p>

<p>Is your sample space the same as <code>(size-2 subsets of fin n) → Prop</code>?  Can you use the product measure on this, from Floris' work? (if that's not overkill).</p>

<p>I don't think this is overkill, but my concern is that doing it like that could be awkward to work with in practice - <code>(size-2 subsets of fin n) -&gt; Prop</code> is ultimately the same thing as the sample space I want, but doing the translation in Lean of probability spaces to one on <code>simple_graph (fin n)</code> feels like it could get painful?</p>

<p>Maybe it works to make the structure "internal" ... here's one idea:  Define a measure on a finite Boolean algebra by giving each atom <code>i</code> a probability <code>p_i</code>, and then make the measure of any other element the product of <code>p_i</code> for each atom less than it with <code>(1 - p_i)</code> for each atom not less than it.  Then, put a Boolean algebra structure on <code>simple_graph (fin n)</code>, where <code>≤</code> means the edges of the first are contained in the edges of the second.</p>

<p>The math here is completely untested, but you get the idea.  Another way would be (if we have "internal" direct products yet) to put an internal direct product structure on <code>simple_graph (fin n)</code>, allowing you to realize the <code>(size-2 subsets of fin n) → Prop</code> idea "from the inside".</p>
