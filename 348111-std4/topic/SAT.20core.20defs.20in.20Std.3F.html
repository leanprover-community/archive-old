<p>Thoughts on putting the core definitions for SAT (CNF formulas, satisfiability, etc.) in Std?</p>
<p>It's a bit outside the scope. I personally would prefer to put it in a separate library, but I'd like us to settle on one set of core defs for all SAT-related projects, for easy interop.</p>

<p>I think that an obstacle to standardization is that depending on what you want to use the CNF for, there are different requirements on the representation. For example <code>List Clause</code> is okay if you only ever need to fold the whole thing but would be absurdly inefficient for a SAT solver. So realistically the library would need to include something like <code>PersistentCnf</code> and <code>Cnf</code>, like <code>List</code> vs <code>Array</code>. But even then, what if you need a clause-database type representation which isn't an Array but some more specific data structure? I think the one thing we could all agree on is the mathematical model which would just be some inductive datatype of propositional formulas :)</p>

<p>If you want to emit efficient code, it seems the thing to do is parameterize over the <em>literal</em> type e.g. so that it can be <code>UInt64</code> and the first bit denotes the polarity. Parameterizing over the variable type forces a representation <code>Literal ν</code> which afaik Lean will represent as boxed which is a lot of pointer dereferencing when these are accessed often.</p>

<p>I agree with Wojciech, this is an area where you can't really standardize the data representation because that depends a lot on what the solver is doing or how it works. The only thing I would expect could be shared are things like <code>List.all</code> for defining the model</p>

<p>I don't think Lean would be viable for writing high-performance SAT solvers at the moment, so I wasn't really thinking about that as an application. I'm moreso looking for us to maintain something akin to <a href="https://pysathq.github.io/">PySAT</a> which is a library for encoding to CNF and interfacing with external SAT solvers.</p>
<p>Maybe for now I just work on building out the PySAT equivalent library, and then we can see if it's a good place for mathlib's LRAT verifier and Cayden's verified encodings to be housed.</p>

<p>We can probably get decently close (i.e. within an order of magnitude) to high performance SAT solvers with lean code if the compiler doesn't fail us, but to get the last bit of performance requires more control over data layout than we have any intention of providing in pure lean code. In this regime the next best thing is to link to a C function or library and axiomatize its behavior using <code>implemented_by</code>; you could still get pretty close to full verification that way if the model is fine-grained enough.</p>

<p>In C++ we face issues with (a) pointer aliasing, (b) partial evaluating the type-specific variants - the templates become crazy, (c) it is hard to supply proofs that certain low-precision types are sufficient, (d) and we cannot synthesis vector code effectively from C++. Lean's pure nature makes pointer aliasing simple to work with and lean is more modular and flexible such that b&amp;d can be addressed, and (c) is what lean is anyway good at.</p>

<p>Also, if you look at how the simplex algorithm is implemented, it is really rewriting matrices in-place. Hence, the initial algorithm can be nicely written in a purely functional style yet the generated code could be fully in place.

<p>Maybe. I feel that this could be orthogonal. It would be nice if this is verified, but I am unsure finding canonical semantics for everything will be easy. The current c annotations also do not come with semantics and are already very useful. Offering a way to add verification seems to be beneficial as an opt in.</p>

<p>In theory we could supply a string of llvm-it that the llvm emitter than translates. This is easy and maybe just a minor change. I feel it would be nice if we would actually parse the LLVM-IR into lean data structure to be able to check certain properties early on and also to be able to eventually attach semantics.

<p>I guess in the end it boils down to how superficial the Lean data structure is that it represents it. A data structure that represents the LLVM/MLIR syntax is surely an improvement over a string, but I'd argue not a terribly big one. If we'd want some sort of semantic representation of the LLVM/MLIR code to be able to e.g. typecheck some of the code, which I think we'd need for your points (a) and (b) perhaps above, although I don't fully understand those. For your point (c) a semantic embedding sounds indispensable, whereas for (d) this probably would already be very useful just to be able to code generate something opaque.</p>
