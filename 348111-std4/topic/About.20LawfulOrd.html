<p>What should <code>LawfulOrd</code> actually be? This was briefly mentioned in another thread. The current version in <code>Std.Classes.Ordering</code> seems to run against other usages of <code>Lawful*</code> in at least two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The current version applies to a function <code>cmp : α → α → Ordering</code> rather than an instance of <code>Ord α</code>, which is just a wrapper around such a function. This seems to be against other such classes such as <code>LawfulBEq</code> which is about an instance of  <code>BEq α </code> rather than a function <code>beq : α → α → Bool</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The current version of <code>LawfulOrd</code> only requires symmetry,  the extension <code>TransOrd</code> additionally requires transitivity, neither requires that equality is tight in the sense that <code>cmp x y = eq →  x = y</code>. In other cases, <code>Lawful*</code> is not the greatest common denominator but rather "least common generalization".  Using that guidance, it would be better if the symmetry-only version to be called <code>SymmOrd</code>,  then extended to <code>TransOrd</code> as it is now, and finally <code>LawfulOrd</code> should require tight equality on top of symmetry and transitivity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, there are arguments that warrant going against prior usage. That <code>LawfulOrd</code> and <code>TransOrd</code> use a function <code>cmp : α → α → Ordering</code> rather than an instance of <code>Ord α</code> makes these classes more nimble. There is also an argument that <code>Lawful*</code> should actually be the greatest common denominator rather than everything but the kitchen sink.</p>
<p>Personally, I like all  the options here with no preference for one or the other, but we can't have it every way. That said, I do like some uniformity and a mix of  all these options is not uniform at all.</p>

<p>The names are indeed misleading there.  <code>TotalBLE</code> says it requires a total order, but then omits all axioms for the order.  I also think that the name <code>LawfulCmp</code> implies a linear order (since <code>LawfulBEq</code> excludes "non-Hausdorff" equivalence relations as well).</p>

<p>To play devil's advocate, <code>LinearCmp</code> would be much clearer in actual meaning.</p>
<p>Returning to angel's advocate, for typical development process <code>LawfulCmp</code> can be assumed to have all the typical properties I could need, just like any other <code>Lawful*</code> class.</p>

<p>Practically speaking, I don't think we can buy anything by weakening transitivity or reflexivity.  Most of this "lawful" zoo is pointless busywork in my eyes.</p>
<p>The only generalization that I can see practical applications for is weakening antisymmetry (and analogous properties).  We often want to e.g. sort on one field, or use an <code>id</code> field for indexing, etc.  Having <code>LawfulPartialBEq</code> (refl.+trans.+symm.), <code>LawfulPartialOrd</code> ("defined by a total preorder," there must be some slick way to say this), <code>LawfulHashable</code> (<code>LawfulPartialBEq</code> + equivalent elems have the same hash), etc., helps with that.</p>

<p>There is two different potential meaning of <code>Lawful</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>fun a b =&gt; compare a b = .lt</code> satisfies some order laws (such as a partial order)</li>
<li><code>[LE α] [LT α]</code> and <code>a ≤ b ⇔ compare a b ≠ .gt</code> <code>a &lt; b ⇔ compare a b = .lt</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the current <code>LawfulBEq</code> has meaning (2) because it is not about general equivalent relation, rather it requires <code>BEq α</code> aligns with <code>Eq α</code>.<br>
One benefit of (2) is that additional constraints (totality, transitivity) can be added as additional class instance requirements like <code>[PartialOrd α]</code> or <code>[TotalOrd α]</code>.</p>

<p>I'm open to renaming the classes if they seem confusing. I don't really want to take a stand on what <code>LawfulOrd</code> should mean, and these classes exist primarily as internal things for std to be able to state its invariants.</p>

<p>But this kind of bikeshedding over what the classes "mean", or whether <code>cmp</code> should be a regular argument or a typeclass arg to <code>LawfulCmp</code>, are something I would like to avoid. These classes have the shapes that are required for the use cases that exist in std. We talked in the other thread about maybe making <code>RBMap</code> take its <code>cmp</code> argument via typeclass instead of explicitly, and if we do that then <code>LawfulCmp</code> would also change to match.</p>

<p>One other point of possible confusion is that when we say a relation is "symmetric" we usually mean <code>R x y -&gt; R y x</code>, and that is not the kind of symmetry that <code>LawfulCmp</code> is talking about. The requirement of <code>LawfulCmp</code> is more like "this comparator induces an order coherently".</p>

<p>Personally, I think <code>LawfulBEq</code> is not well named. (I would like us to get to the point that we can call it <code>DecidableEq</code>, but we aren't there yet.) <code>LawfulX</code> in my opinion should refer to the weakest requirements under which reasoning is possible, something close to "well formed". I think we should expect the "default case" for <code>BEq</code> is that it represents an equivalence relation, i.e. <code>Setoid</code>. Asking for equality on-the-dot is quite often too much to ask for in programming contexts, so I'm skeptical that <code>LawfulOrd</code> meaning a comparator that induces a (transitive, antisymmetric) linear order will get much use in data structures, although it might show up in instances when you happen to have this stronger property.</p>

<p>Yes, I also think that an antisymmetry-less version could be very useful.</p>

<p>I agree with everything that has been said. After some greping, I noticed that with the exception of  <code>LawfulBEq</code>, all of the <code>Lawful*</code> classes in core are exact characterizations. For example, <code>LawfulFunctor</code>, <code>LawfulApplicative</code>, <code>LawfulMonad</code> are all unambiguously what they should mean. So perhaps the issue is that <code>Lawful*</code> shouldn't be used in contexts where it's not obvious what that means. So neither <code>LawfulBEq</code> nor <code>LawfulOrd</code> should exist because the meaning is too ambiguous?</p>
<p>Since Leo appears to be in favor of Gabriel's redefinition of <code>DecidableEq</code>, the issue with <code>LawfulBEq</code> might disappear on its own in core lean4. In the mean time, perhaps <code>Lawful*</code> should be avoided in  std4 unless the meaning is unambiguous? Does that sound like a reasonable conclusion?</p>

<p>I think that still leaves open the question of what to call <code>LawfulCmp</code> though. I don't think <code>SymmCmp</code> is a good name because I don't think symmetry has the right connotation in this context, even though the axiom itself can be called a kind of symmetry. What about <code>OrderedCmp</code>, in the sense "comparator that induces an order"? Although if it is replaced with a theorem about an <code>Ord</code> implementation then <code>OrderedOrd</code> doesn't make a whole lot of sense.</p>

<p><code>OrientedCmp</code> sounds great to me!</p>
<p>Do you mean <code>Directed</code> in the sense that any two elements have an upper bound?  I don't think that confusion would occur  in this case since any preorder arising from a comparison function must be total, so any subset is automatically directed.</p>
