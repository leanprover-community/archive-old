<p>Hello everyone! I've implemented pairing heaps following <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Std.BinomialHeap#doc">docs4#Std.BinomialHeap</a>. This is my first time programming with lean and I don't have a lot of experience. Currently the namings are also a bit arbitrary. Should I submit it to std4 as a PR?</p>

<p>You can. Just be forewarned that the bandwidth for helping with "not a lot of experience" PRs into std4 is limited at the moment, and depending on resources it may or may not get a prompt review or feedback. :-)</p>

<p>(Historically mathlib3 has been good --- or at least tried to be good --- about helping out with PRs from new contributors. Std4 and Lean4 however have only a few people who can do the reviews for now, and they are very busy!)</p>
