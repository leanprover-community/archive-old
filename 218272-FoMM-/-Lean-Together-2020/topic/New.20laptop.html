<p>The bad news is that I had a minor mishap yesterday which resulted in my laptop getting completely borked. I am hoping to buy a new one at Target when it opens at 8am.  The good news is that that creates an opportunity to observe/debug/improve the process of installing Lean on a Windows machine. Let me know if you're interested in that. I certainly want to get it done today.</p>

<p>I have installed Lean on my new laptop following the instructions at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/install/windows.md" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/install/windows.md">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/install/windows.md</a> as far as possible.  However, some amendments to those instructions will be needed. I have detailed notes and a bunch of screenshots.  I will attempt to go through <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/install/project.md" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/install/project.md">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/docs/install/project.md</a> as well, then I will put together a PR for the documentation.  However, it might be more efficient for interested people to talk about it first while we are in Pittsburgh.</p>
