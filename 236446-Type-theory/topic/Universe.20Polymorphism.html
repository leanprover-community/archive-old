<p>How is universe polymorphism handled in Lean? I have some vague recollection of reading that Lean figures out which levels are needed for each universe polymorphic type and creates a version of the type for each required universe level. I'm guessing this would imply that universe polymorphism doesn't need to be a part of Lean's metatheory. <br>
Is this correct?</p>

<p>It doesn't do this, each kernel declaration has a field containing the level parameters, and downstream uses refer to the polymorphic version.</p>

<p>Top-level constants (i.e. definitions, axioms, etc.), and only top-level constants, have (zero or more) universe variables. Each use of a top-level constant instantiates it at particular values of those universe variables (which may themselves be universe variables of the surrounding definition, or more complicated universe expressions built from them).</p>

<p>Maybe a way to put it is that if you have a declaration with a universe variable, the thing that's in the environment is <code>name := MyThing, universeParams := [u]</code>. There isn't a <code>MyThing [1]</code>, <code>MyThing[2]</code>, <code>MyThing[3]</code> for each concrete use.<br>
When you retrieve the declaration/constant from the environment you substitute the universes that are actually being used (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/bda871da25c72248e6958b32a153c27e2b73f5cb/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp#L84">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/bda871da25c72248e6958b32a153c27e2b73f5cb/src/kernel/type_checker.cpp#L84</a>)</p>

<p>I just found the source of my vague recollection:</p>

<p>... when you write</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">universe</span> <span class="n">u</span>
<span class="kd">constant</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span> <span class="n">u</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>you are really defining a parametric family of constants, denoted <code>a.{u}</code>. It's not like <code>a</code> exists in some particular universe <code>u</code>, rather there is a different <code>a</code> at each universe: <code>a.{0} : Type 0</code>, <code>a.{1} : Type 1</code> and so on. This is the same way that the <code>variables</code> command works: every definition is implicitly universally quantified over <code>variable</code> declarations in scope, and when you use the definition later you can supply different values for the variables.</p>
<p>Universe parameters are usually implicit, so when you write <code>#check a</code> what it really means is <code>#check a.{_}</code>. Lean has to pick some universe variable to fill the <code>_</code>, and it makes up <code>u_1</code> as a universe variable name. So the output is saying <code>a.{u_1} : Type u_1</code>, although the <code>.{u_1}</code> part is hidden unless you set <code>set_option pp.universes true</code>.</p>

<p>I'm guessing I misinterpreted the meaning of this explanation. But now I don't understand how it matches the explanation given by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="228466">@Chris Bailey</span> above.</p>

<p>The environment only contains a single definition <code>a</code>, which is universe-polymorphic.</p>

<p>Lean's metatheory needs to contain some amount of universe polymorphism since in actual practice we have to typecheck universe polymorphic definitions, but lean is a conservative extension of lean with no universe polymorphism (where all universe levels are concrete numerals). Each lean definition is a simple scheme over such theorems, and if you can prove a contradiction in lean then you can instantiate all the variables to 0 to obtain a contradiction in this fixed-universe version of lean. I actually develop this mapping in detail in <a href="https://github.com/digama0/lean-type-theory/releases/tag/v1.0">#leantt</a></p>

<p>To give a concrete example of what I meant, if you have:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">exampleList</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">list</span> <span class="n">punit.</span><span class="o">{</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">list.nil</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>There 's one standalone <code>list</code> declaration in the environment which is the universe polymorphic one <code>name := list, uparams := [u], type := Π (T : Sort S(u)), (Sort S(u))</code>, but when checking the above definition <code>App (Const (list.nil, [S(0)]), Const (punit, [S(S(0))]))</code>, the inference step gets the type of <code>list.nil</code> by referencing the universe polymorphic version with type <code>Π {T : Sort S(u)}, (App (Const (list, [u]), v0))</code>, then subbing in the universes currently being used to get <code>Π {T : Sort S(S(0))}, (App (Const (list, [S(0)]), Var0))</code>.</p>
