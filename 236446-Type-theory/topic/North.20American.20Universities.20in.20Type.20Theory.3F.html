<p>I just graduated from the University of Alberta with a BSC in Math and I plan to apply to grad schools in NA. I'm really interested in math foundations and I've been recently reading the HoTT book, set theory, and math logic books. Are there schools in NA that focus on these areas? My school sadly doesn't teach these in the math department ( but I remember there are math logic courses in the philosophy department). Am I focusing on the wrong area for a math MSC?</p>

<p>Look at the list of authors of the HoTT book. A whole bunch of them are in NA.</p>
