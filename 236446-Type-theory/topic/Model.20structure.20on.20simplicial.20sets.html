<p>My best guess is something like: when you have a category with enough structure, you can interpret logic inside of it, and oftentimes phrasing proofs in the internal logic turns out to be easier (there's lots of examples in Section D of the Elephant, such as D.1.3.13 and D.1.3.14) - this is the internalization part at least.</p>

<p>Speculating even further now, but this idea carries further when you define more internal notions, eg an internal ring or an internal category, and then if you proved your theorems constructively, their proofs should carry over exactly into the internal logic</p>

<p>I think that this process of "internalized logic in a category" is the whole story of how HoTT became a foundation: first it was a category structure, then it grew so many structures that you can do logic in it, then people decided to use it as the metalogic and forget about the ambient logic (whatever it was)</p>

<p>I didn't hallucinate it but I did somewhat misremember it, and it seems to not (yet) be known to be part of a model category. So, at the moment it seems that there is actually one clearly correct way to define the classical model structure with the correct constructive interpretation.</p>

<p>and that's what the HoTT book uses - it is all logic "internal" to HoTT, which can also be interpreted as constructions inside a model of HoTT in a metalogic (classical or otherwise)</p>

<p>In particular, in order to interpret HoTT as having something to do with homotopy theory, you need to be working in a metalogic that can formalize homotopy theory and a suitable category of homotopy types that is a model of HoTT</p>

<p>So there is apparently some model structure on cubical sets that satisfies univalence and can be used to model HoTT, and it's constructive, and I think this is supposed to be related to why cubical type theory satisfies canonicity or whatever.</p>

<p>But there is a whole lot of machinery between the syntax of HoTT and a model category that I don't understand, so it's unclear to me what the exact relationship is.</p>

<p>For the record I'm gonna weaken my position on wanting the hott model to be constructive - though I'd still aesthetically like it I wouldn't have any objection to starting off with going full classical</p>

<p>Actually now I can't find anything about the other structure (with all monomorphisms as cofibrations); hopefully I didn't hallucinate it.</p>

<p>I didn't hallucinate it but I did somewhat misremember it, and it seems to not (yet) be known to be part of a model category. So, at the moment it seems that there is actually one clearly correct way to define the classical model structure with the correct constructive interpretation.</p>

<p>So, what's this supposed model structure? Is it written anywhere?</p>

<p>Interesting. I always thought that the fact that not all simplicial sets are cofibrant is a major drawback of the constructive approach.</p>
