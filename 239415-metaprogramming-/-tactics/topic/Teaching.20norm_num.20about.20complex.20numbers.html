<p>Hi. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="266440">@Shing Tak Lam</span> already gave me some helpful pointers to track this down, but I'm afraid I don't know enough to get it over the finishing line yet.</p>
<p>I noticed that <code>norm_num</code> can't solve arithmetic equations in complex numbers despite its docstring seemingly saying it should (my original example was <code>example : (2 + 3 * I) * (4 + 5 * I) = -7 + 22 * I := by norm_num</code> which does not work without <code>by ext; norm_num</code>).</p>
<p>Two questions:</p>
<p>1) Is this indeed within the intended scope of <code>norm_num</code>? Its docstring does seem to say "Supports the operations <code>+</code> <code>-</code> <code>*</code> <code>/</code> <code>^</code> and <code>%</code> over numerical types such as <code>ℕ</code>, <code>ℤ</code>, <code>ℚ</code>, <code>ℝ</code>, <code>ℂ</code>".<br>
2) Assuming it is, I added the failing <code>example : complex.I ≠ 2 := by norm_num</code> to <code>test/norm_num.lean</code> -- is the right way to fix this say to try calling <code>tactic.ext</code> within <code>norm_num1</code> and if it succeeds recurse into each of the constructors with what's done today? (If so, can I have a hint as to how that's done?) Or should I try to figure out a way to add a <code>@[norm_num]</code> extension to <code>data.complex</code> specific to complex numbers? I can't quite tell whether the latter is precisely meant for this use case, it seems to talk about being used for new functions really, not types.</p>

<p><code>norm_num</code> does not support complex number arithmetic. It supports the operations <code>+</code> <code>-</code> <code>*</code> etc over <code>ℂ</code>, but <code>I</code> is not supported so you can prove <code>(2 + 2 : ℂ) = 4</code> but not <code>(2 + I) * I = -1 + 2 * I</code></p>

<p>One general way to handle it would be to use the grobner tactic (that doesn't exist) to prove ring equalities in C given the equation <code>I * I + 1 = 0</code></p>

<p>Got it, so it's indeed not in the intended scope sounds like, thanks. Would a docstring fix be welcome then, I don't think I was the only one slightly confused by the way it's phrased now. Maybe even just <code>"Supports the operations + - * / ^ and % over numerical types such as ℕ, ℤ, ℚ, ℝ, and partially over ℂ"</code>?</p>

<p>Adding new types to <code>norm_num</code> can be done, but it is tricky if the set of normal forms needs to be expanded. Most of it assumes that normal forms are numerals with maybe a minus sign (for integers) or fraction (for rationals), over any type (i.e. <code>3 / 5 : ℝ</code> is a normal form but not <code>pi : ℝ</code>). Adding complex numbers would require some specific recognizable normal form that matches the existing one for real numbers</p>

<p>Ah interesting ok, so my wording up top isn't appropriate then either -- it's about whether it's a numeric literal moreso than what type it is?</p>

<p><em>nod</em> thanks I think that's making some more sense now -- Though, just because I thought of this playfully yesterday when playing around and you mentioned it -- by "recognizable normal form" -- does that have to be across all types? E.g. if you encode complexes by say concatenating the digits of the real and imaginary parts with some numeric separator like <code>00</code> does that "work" (preserve the type info) or does that mean that now norm_num will think (1 + 2i) = (1002 : R)?</p>

<p>Right I know that works (it was what Shing or Bhavik told me to use instead of <code>ring + simp</code>) I was mostly asking to see whether <code>norm_num</code> <em>should</em> have worked alone, which the docstring to us I think seemed like it should have.</p>

<p>I'm not sure I understand your suggestion. The normal form has to be sound, at least - any expression that can be normalized should normalize to a normal form that is provably equal to the original. Your 1002 example doesn't satisfy that</p>

<p>One example of a normal form is <code>&lt;numeral&gt; + &lt;numeral&gt; * I</code>, but an issue with this representation is that it includes operations that norm_num understands, so it will attempt to add and multiply the components, resulting in added busywork</p>
