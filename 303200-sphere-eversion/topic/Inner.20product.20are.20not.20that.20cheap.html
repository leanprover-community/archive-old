<p>We've finally hit the point where assuming inner product spaces everywhere this was locally more convenient strikes back.</p>

<p>The problem is that we don't have product inner product spaces. See <a href="#narrow/stream/217875-Is-there-code-for-X.3F/topic/Inner.20product.20space.20on.20.CE.B1.20.C3.97.20.CE.B2">this topic</a></p>

<p>When reducing to the non-parametric case we use a product manifold. This is fine if there are no inner product spaces around. But then the localization work uses inner product spaces everywhere. If I understood correctly at that time, this was simply convenient when building diffeomorphisms between balls and whole spaces.</p>

<p>If this is indeed the only reason then the correct fix is clearly to go back to <code>global/smooth_embedding.lean</code> and work harder there.</p>

<p>I feel that it will be easier  to do as much as we can using inner product spaces, and then only at the end transform it to a statement about normed spaces (possibly using the fact that all norms are equivalent on a finite dimensional vector space). Otherwise you are dealing with 2 different norms when dealing e.g. with <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/cont_diff_bump">docs#cont_diff_bump</a>.</p>

<p>Yes, I think that's the current situation. Concrete manifolds are typically constructed using <code>𝓘(ℝ, E)</code>, but abstract theorems should be stated assuming <code>boundaryless</code> because that's stable under products.</p>
<p>If you see ways to improve on this, don't hesitate to do it! You should have played enough with the manifolds to see the weak points of the current implementation and possible improvements, hopefully.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the various quick revisions means that the code quality in <code>smooth_embedding.lean</code> is getting quite low but for now this is a secondary concern.</p>
