<p><a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/sphere-eversion/blueprint/chap-local.html#lem:h_principle_open_ample_loc">Lemma 2.16</a> is essentially done modulo the key <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/sphere-eversion/blueprint/chap-local.html#lem:integration_step">Lemma 2.11</a> and some easy sorries. The blueprint describes this as a "straightforward induction using lemma 2.11" but the Lean proof is still <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/sphere-eversion/blob/56cb9c281db6da7ec91d03cd9c5b069a851b1b42/src/local/h_principle.lean#L296-L305">100 lines long</a> and I wanted to have it to make sure the data and properties flow well.</p>

<p>This proof needs cleaning of course, but it shows a lot of things work well.</p>

<p>It also generated quite a few accessible sorries, in case anyone is tired of Lie algebras.</p>
