<p>There are news about Chapter 3. I decided we should try to take a shortcut. Rather than going through the general vector bundle theory, I <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/sphere-eversion/blob/9f1b864bbf6f4aa8e0d7f3df2643776133291e39/src/global/one_jet_bundle.lean#L32-L33">half defined</a> a <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/basic_smooth_vector_bundle_core">docs#basic_smooth_vector_bundle_core</a>. Here "half" means I defined data but proved nothing.  Hopefully that definition is correct (we won't know for sure until we actually prove the lemmas in that file). A basic smooth bundle  is a vector bundle over a manifold which is trivial over each coordinate chart of the manifold. This is quite a bit simpler than a general vector bundle, but it is sufficient for all bundles we care about in this project. For instance this shortcut is already used to define the tangent bundle. </p>
<p>Assuming this definition of the 1-jet bundle, I was able to define many things that were blocking progress on Chapter 3. But I didn't prove anything. So there are currently 27 sorries in the project, all Prop, no missing data. So now is a very good time to contribute to the project.</p>

<p>Thanks Patrick! I look forward to starting squash them tomorrow :-)</p>

<p>I admit I started with easy ones but those 27 sorries have now become 23.</p>
