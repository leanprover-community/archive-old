<p>Hi! After a year-long break from lean, I came back to my project of formalizing things in graph theory and adapted what I already had to the <code>simple_graph</code> API. I managed to show for instance that graph minors form a transitive relation, but what I wrote feels wrong ... I would be glad if someone had a look at my code here <a href="https://github.com/vbeffara/lean">https://github.com/vbeffara/lean</a> and give me pointers to improve it :-)</p>
<p>I will slice it into smaller bits and submit it to mathlib but as of now there is too much refactoring needed ...</p>

<p>BTW in retrospect, I am defining the contraction of a graph along a collection of edges given as a smaller simple_graph on the same vertex type, but that is probably not the best way to proceed. I now believe it would be better to define a simple_graph structure on any <code>quotient</code> of the vertex type of a graph by a <code>setoid</code>, see what extends to that setting, and then say more specific stuff when the setoid has connected classes. </p>
<p>One slightly annoying aspect of the construction is that there is in general no projection that is also a graph <code>rel_hom</code> (because of the <code>loopless</code> part), so this is one place where working on graphs without the <code>loopless</code> assumption would be more natural. As it is now, for instance proving that the contraction of a connected graph is connected is a bit awkward - at least the way I do it by constructing paths, there is probably a better way.</p>

<p>(Alternatively, a <code>lazy_walk</code> defined as a <code>walk</code> that is also allowed to sometimes stay where it is could be useful when looking at connectivity properties. But then transforming it into a usual <code>walk</code> involves decidable equality AFAICT.)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="242586">@Vincent Beffara</span> One version of a simple graph is known as a "reflexive graph," where the relation is reflexive.  Walks in a reflexive graph are allowed to stay put because of this.  More generally, the image of a graph homomorphism of reflexive graphs is a graph contraction.</p>

<p><strong>Design question time:</strong> should graphs have a <code>connected_graph</code> typeclass, or is it fine carrying around a <code>G.connected</code> proof?</p>
<p>For: connected graphs are sort of the "default" for a lot of theory, so we want to make it easy to pass connectedness around.</p>
<p>Against: if we do pass the <code>hc : G.connected</code> proof around, then we can put lemmas about connectedness in the <code>connected</code> namespace then refer to them with <code>hc.lemma_name</code>, and that's fine.</p>

<p>I maintain. The class is stating that a graph-like object is a graph, but the graph-like object is already graph-like without.</p>

<p>Oops, I really failed to say what the idea was.  If we have <code>connected</code> as a plain old property, then we can also have a class</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="n">connected_graph</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">G</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">simple_graph</span> <span class="n">V</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:=</span>

<span class="kn">export</span> <span class="n">connected_graph</span>

<p>and then if you do <code>G.conn</code>, it tries to obtain the proof of connectedness by some means (typeclass argument, typeclass search, or what have you).</p>

<p>but then the tradeoff is that when you have a graph constructed on-the-fly like Yakov said, you need to <code>haveI</code> or something to be able to use the corresponding lemma/def.</p>

<p>To be fair, the whole reason that there is a <code>connected</code> class in my file is that I once talked with Sébastien Gouëzel about formalizing Cayley graphs, he told me something along the lines of "the best way to do that is to have a graph class and to construct an instance of if on top of a group" and then bridging this to metric spaces made more sense with a class as well for connectivity. No big design idea or anything. (My initial approach was to have a graph structure, rather like it is now in mathlib.)</p>
<p>But then, trying to show that two different Cayley graphs of the same group are quasi-isometric, I struggled a lot with juggling with two instances of the same class on the same object, with code like this,</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">def</span> <span class="n">Cayley</span> <span class="n">gen</span> <span class="n">G</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">G</span>
<span class="kd">instance</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">gen</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="n">G</span><span class="o">}</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">graph</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Cayley</span> <span class="n">gen</span> <span class="n">G</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="gr">sorry</span> <span class="c1">-- actual implementation</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>and casting <code>id</code> into <code>Cayley gen1 G -&gt; Cayley gen2 G</code> and so on. Felt rather unnatural to me, as opposed to having two graph structures on the same underlying type. Going to the mathlib API when it appeared, I kept the typeclass more out of laziness than anything else <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span></p>

<p>BTW, assuming we know how to build an instance like this,</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">instance</span> <span class="n">bla</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">graph_class</span> <span class="n">g</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">h</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">g.connected</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">metric_space</span> <span class="n">g</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="gr">sorry</span>

<p>and within a proof we get <code>(h : g.connected)</code> in the context and need the metric, will typeclass resolution work it out or do we need to <code>letI : metric_space g := bla h</code> by hand?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="242586">@Vincent Beffara</span> I'm not sure if you've had a chance to take a look at them, but the sorts of graph classes that are independently under consideration might not be what you expect. They're classes for the type of graphs themselves, rather than classes for individual graphs (which have the problems you ran into). So it would be, say, that there's an instance <code>graph_class (simple_graph V) V</code>, or something like that, and then that would give you generic functions and lemmas for terms of type <code>simple_graph V</code>.</p>

<p>Your example for <code>metric_space</code> is interesting puzzle... We won't want <code>metric_space V</code>, since multiple simple graphs have the same vertex type, and we probably want to compare metric space structures with varying graphs.</p>
<p>I guess for that, we'll want some function that gets the vertex type from a graph, so it would look like <code>metric_space G.V</code> or something.</p>
<p>This instance is also a point in favor of having this <code>connected_graph</code> class that wraps up a proof of <code>G.connected</code>.</p>
