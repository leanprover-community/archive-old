<p>Hello all! I'm still learning the in's and outs's of lean and it's community, so if this isn't the right place to post this then let me know. I recently set myself the challenge to try to prove a simple statement in lean3, namely that the complete graph on 4 vertices is planar. This is based off of <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="242586">@Vincent Beffara</span> 's definition of planar that I found in an PR linked in this group.</p>
<p>Despite the triviality of the statement, the resulting proof was much longer (and harder) than I expected and it's current form is plagued by deterministic timeout and memory issues. As far as I can tell, the issues stem from my frequent usage of <code>fin_cases</code>, but I am not able to figure out a way around them.</p>
<p>I was wondering if anyone here had any ideas for how to reduce the load on lean?<br>
The proof in it's current form can be found <a href="https://github.com/IEavan/planar-lean/blob/k4/src/graph_theory/k4.lean">here</a>.<br>
Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>I think your life would be a bit easier with <code>def K4 := complete_graph (fin 4)</code> rather than <code>def K4 := complete_graph (finset.range 4)</code>; <code>complete_graph</code> is expecting to eat a type and you're giving it a quite a complex term which is then being coerced to a type, so you're already doomed to a bit of superfluous jumping through hoops.</p>

<p>The definition of planar and the machinery around it are in the rest of the repo which is a fork of Vincent's work <a href="https://github.com/vbeffara/lean/tree/main/src/graph_theory">here</a>. As Kyle mentions the definition of planar is that graph G is planar if  there exists an embedding of G's vertices into the infinite square lattice and an embedding of G's edges into paths in the infinite square lattice such that paths don't intersect.<br>
Although reconsidering this definition now, it is clear that this definition doesn't work for planar graphs with vertices with degree 5 or more.</p>
<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> for the improved definition for the mapping to the plane :)<br>
I'm still a little unclear on the benefit of using <code>fin 4</code> versus <code>finset.range 4</code> as both seem to represent the same idea of <code>{0,1,2,3}</code>?</p>

<p>One is a (definitionally simple) type and one is a (definitionally complex) term. The function expects a type so why not give it a type, as opposed to be something which was designed to be a term and then is being promoted by you to a type via a coercion (the up-arrow which you will no doubt have seen everywhere in your approach and which isn't there in mine). In short "the canonical type with four elements is <code>fin 4</code>". This is just my opinion though and there are plenty of people here who understand definitional issues in lean 3 better than I do.</p>

<p>Yes the definition of planar in that repo is definitely wrong for graphs with degree larger than 4. I was going for saying that planar meant being a minor of Z^2, but the path embedding definition was quicker to write so I used it temporarily then spent a lot of time defining minors, and forgot to  update the definition afterwards. And then I let the code rot, I would actually be surprised if it still compiled with recent mathlib.</p>

<p>I think he goes the triple of permutations way but I am not sure. Minor of Z2 felt like a natural choice but there might be issues for non locally finite graphs or such abominations. The most common definition I found used continuous paths in the plane and that certainly doesn't sound like something we want to use as a definition when formalizing ...</p>

<p>Or we could sidestep the issue and say that a planar graph is a graph that has neither K5 nor K33 as a minor, and prove that such a graph has an embedding in the plane. (That was meant as a joke but not completely.)</p>

<p>Is it possible to have graphs that are non-planar because the cardinality is too high to embed them in R^2? For example, aleph_2 discrete points should almost certainly be planar by a combinatorial definition but you can't embed it in the plane if "without crossings" also implies that no points are coincident</p>

<p>&lt;s&gt;Finite subgraph definition isn't compatible with the Kuratowski definition: consider K5 with each edge replaced by an infinite path.&lt;/s&gt; Edit: no such thing as an infinite path.<br>
Perhaps consider all finite minors instead?<br>
Edit: finite subgraph definition and finite minor definition is equivalent if minor is defined by paths (not sure if any other definition exists) if I'm not wrong.</p>

<p>(that is equivalent to the Kuratowski definition)</p>

<p>Here's an old implementation of combinatorial maps: <a href="https://github.com/kmill/lean-graphs/blob/master/src/maps.lean">https://github.com/kmill/lean-graphs/blob/master/src/maps.lean</a></p>
<p>Planar graphs correspond to combinatorial maps whose euler characteristic (line 257) is equal to the number of connected components.</p>
<p>I think I have another implementation somewhere -- I thought I had started to write a statement of Sperner's lemma for combinatorial maps.</p>

<p>That sounds both true and reassuring :-)</p>
