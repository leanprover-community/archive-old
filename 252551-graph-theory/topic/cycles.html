<p>Hi! (new user to the stream and mostly in general). I want to exhibit a (finite) directed graph and prove it's a cycle, and then prove a thing or two about  paths on it. Is this possibly a reasonable thing to attempt given any of the graph theory code that's been written? I see most of the code is likely on graph-theory-related branches of mathlib right?</p>

<p>Oh, also -- I should mention by "exhibit" I mean "I have a function from X \to (set X)", so I want to get my graph by inducing it from that function.</p>

<p>We don't have directed graphs yet -- most energy has been put into simple graphs because of some basic complications to them that needed solving.</p>
<p>One thing about directed graphs without multiedges is that they're essentially just relations (indeed, <code>X -&gt; set X</code> is equivalent to <code>X -&gt; X -&gt; Prop</code>), so you might get a lot of mileage out of what mathlib already has about those. For example, paths correspond the transitive closure of the relation.</p>

<p>Because of this, directed graphs will probably be with multiple edges, something like</p>

<p>Aha, thanks! That looks like a great breadcrumb, will have a look.</p>
