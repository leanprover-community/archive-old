<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="246273">@Bhavik Mehta</span> would you be willing to update your finite and infinite Ramsey proofs to work with the current mathlib? I tried that with the finite version and fixed a problem <code>exists_mem_of_ne_empty</code> with the <a href="https://github.com/b-mehta/combinatorics/blob/extras/src/ramsey.lean">finite version</a> (see my fix using  <a href="https://gist.github.com/hmonroe/80b4fc7f4cefaf94d6f785f5520dcf44">calc</a>) but could not work out how to fix <code>insert_empty_eq_singleton</code>. It would be good to get some version of your proofs into mathlib which can later be improved upon and generalized.</p>

<p>I can have a go at updating the infinite Ramsey proof, that's pretty much in a maximal generality. For the finite Ramsey proof, I think the approach isn't quite right, and that it would actually be easier to go straight for a more general version</p>
