<p>So I'm currently struggling to put together an mwe for a question I'd like to ask because of the various imports from within the project, like my lemma sort of builds on a lot of different definitions</p>

<p>Since we're all more or less working on the same code, would it be alright if I just posted mwes with imports from within the project? (going to include my own definitions/lemmas in the mwe of course)</p>

<p>I think it's still instructive to try to minimise your code to see exactly where the problem is, but you can probably just post a we anyway</p>

<p>In particular back when I was starting out I sometimes managed to figure out what the actual problem was in the process of minimising, and learnt quite a bit that way</p>

<p>It's not exactly a problem, it's more a question of how I should approach proving a lemma</p>

<p>Ah fair, in that case a we should be fine :)</p>

<p>Like I have the rough outline of how it should go, I just have a specific question about one step of the implementation</p>

<p>just kidding, i realized that there are a lot of differences between what i'm working on and what's in the hedetniemi branch</p>

<p>I've been working on code that's probably more similar to yours, if you want to post anyway</p>
