<p>Hi guys! Can someone recommend some resources to start theorem proving in graph theory in Lean. Some basic topics like defining the graph and simple theorems related to that, some tactics made for graphs etc.</p>

<p>I know <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="429543">@Barrie Cooper</span> made a game for multigraphs here <a href="https://barriecooper.github.io/html/index.html">https://barriecooper.github.io/html/index.html</a></p>
<p>I'm not aware of any pre-written resources about learning Lean graph theory yet -- there really isn't that much of it.  You can read the source code for <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/simple_graph">docs#simple_graph</a>, which is all in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/master/src/combinatorics/simple_graph">this directory</a>, starting with <code>basic.lean</code> (just ignore <code>. obviously</code> if you're not familiar with it).  There's also the <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/archive/100-theorems-list/83_friendship_graphs.lean">friendship theorem</a> as well as a few things in the <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+simple_graph">PR queue</a>, especially incidence matrices and paths/connectivity.</p>
<p>If there's some theorem you might be interested in formalizing, you can mention it here in the <a class="stream" data-stream-id="252551" href="/#narrow/stream/252551-graph-theory">#graph theory</a> stream and we can help plan it out.</p>

<p>There are definitely no graph theory specific tactics right now.  (Maybe the closest, which is a stretch, is in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/8737">#8737</a> when I tried to prove there was no Eulerian trail in the seven bridges of Konigsberg problem using <code>dec_trivial</code>, but it fails to work for a mysterious reason.)</p>

<p>I don't (and I've only read through its source code before -- I haven't tried it myself).</p>
<p>Note that it's about multigraphs, but mathlib only has simple graphs right now.</p>

<p>It would be great if u could provide a snippet of how one would initialise a simple graph (eg a triangle ) using a <code>simple_graph</code> structure. It might make things more clearer for me regarding Lean also :)</p>

<p><code>complete_graph</code> defines a graph using the structure. It's able to skip <code>sym</code> and <code>loopless</code> because the <code>tidy</code> tactic is able to automatically fill in those proofs.</p>

<p>(This is the function of <code>. obviously</code> in the <code>structure</code> definition. It tells Lean to try the <code>tidy</code> tactic if that field is missing.)</p>
