<p>In <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14034">#14034</a>, I took a stab at defining induced graphs to get characterizations of cliques in terms of induced graphs being complete graphs and to get lower bounds on chromatic numbers from existence of cliques.</p>
<p>After messing with things for a while, it seems like the easiest thing is to have two different types of induced graphs. The first is <code>simple_graph.induce</code>, which takes a <code>simple_graph V</code> and produces a <code>simple_graph s</code> by just restricting the vertex set. The second is <code>simple_graph.subgraph.induce</code>, which takes a <code>G.subgraph</code> and produces another <code>G.subgraph</code>.  They both seem useful and have different properties, similar to edge deletion.</p>
<p>With this PR, you can express that a set <code>s</code> of vertices forms a clique by <code>G.induce s = ⊤</code>. This is harder to express using <code>simple_graph.subgraph.induce</code> without, say, introducing an additional <code>simple_graph.subgraph.is_complete</code> predicate.</p>

<p>I wonder if there's a shorter proof for <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14034/files#diff-7010f320595c97e1a7be264585c6cc6350d5af00c4a6d56cfb2cc4198911e374R140">clique_free_iff</a></p>

<p>Me too. The current proof is scary!</p>

<p>(Ping: <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="133584">@Joseph Hua</span> I know you were doing some things with induced graphs a while back, and I started with a bit of code of yours from the Zulip. Let me know if you you have anything that we should try merging, and if you want to be listed as a coauthor feel free to add your name and/or add a <code>Co-authored-by</code> in the PR summary.)</p>

<p>It would be very cool to have induced subgraphs because then I could upgrade our triangle removal to Jacob Fox's graph removal.</p>

<p>Just as a note to the future, some things I started implementing for this PR but deleted:</p>
<ul>
<li>if <code>G' : G.subgraph</code>, the map from <code>G'.coe.subgraph</code> to <code>G.subgraph</code></li>
<li>the map from <code>simple_graph s</code> to <code>G.subgraph</code> by intersecting with the induced subgraph</li>
<li>lemmas for double applications of <code>simple_graph.induce</code> (I didn't want to figure out the right way to handle the subtypes)</li>
<li>vertex deletion for <code>simple_graph</code> (may as well just induce using the complement?)</li>
<li>a <code>simple_graph.subgraph.is_complete</code> predicate (may as well use <code>G'.coe = ⊤</code>?)</li>
</ul>

<p>Hi there, sorry I never actually started working on formalising graph theory, as I got absorbed into other projects! (and sorry for the late replay I haven't checked Zulip in a while)</p>
