<p><a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/12195">#12195</a> moves darts from <code>degree_sum</code> to <code>basic</code>. It's nice to see that they've been finding more uses. (Ping: <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="242586">@Vincent Beffara</span>.)</p>
<p>A breaking change: <code>dart</code> now extends <code>prod</code> so that they're more directly ordered pairs of vertices. I was thinking this made it so that it can interface easier with edges of a simple graph (no need to break apart the underlying pair of an edge to form a dart), but I haven't really tested anything. Thoughts?</p>

<p>I myself wanted this change. Extending <code>prod</code> is nifty <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span> <br>

<p>Indeed, I got the prod idea from having reviewed <code>two_pointing</code></p>

<p>Bikeshed: <code>arc</code> is another term for a directed edge, perhaps more common in graph theory (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph</a>)</p>

<p>Unless the point is to explicitly say "this is an orientation of an undirected edge" (say, if you want to recover the underlying undirected edge in case of multigraphs)</p>

<p>Yes, that's the point -- I think <code>arc</code> should be reserved for graphs with directed edges.  The <code>dart</code> terminology comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_map">combinatorial maps</a>, which are unoriented graphs with an additional "rotation structure" (a cyclic ordering of incident darts at each vertex).</p>

<p>That's fair, thanks for the explanation!</p>

<p>Cool! Also bikeshed: sometimes "half-edge" is used as well to mean something similar (I saw it in models of random graphs using the configuration model, where one first samples vertices with random degrees and the corresponding half-edges, and then pairs the half-edges into the edges of a graph). But dart sounds better in the general context.</p>

<p>How about hypermaps / constellations / rotation systems next?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="242586">@Vincent Beffara</span> Just remembered your suggestion about half-edges, so here's a PR to mention this synonym in the documentation: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/13312">#13312</a></p>
<p>One reason I didn't go with half-edges originally is that it wasn't obvious to me which end of the ordered pair was the half-edge. (I think I've used both possibilities before in non-formalized math!)</p>
