<p>The <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/3458">#3458</a> PR might finally get in sometime soon.  I figure it's better to get that in sooner than later since it's a reasonably solid basic simple graphs library that a number of people seem to have based some work on.  I also figure that, wherever our experiments might lead us, it'll be a manageable amount of work updating things.</p>

<p>actually now it's only waiting for <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="302826">@Aaron Anderson</span> to check that Kyle made the final edit request by Bryan, and then Aaron can hit <code>bors r+</code> to kick it on the queue.</p>
