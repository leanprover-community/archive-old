<p>I've been Leaning for a few months, and don't have an extensive background in type theory or functional programming. I've really enjoyed the codewars platform so far, but I've found that I often get stuck on a codewars problem, spend a long time going through API, finally get to an incredibly messy solution, and then realize there was  a tactic or theorem in a different file that I didn't know about that made the whole process a lot easier. What should be the standard procedure for getting hints for problems? I know some platforms have a system where you can sacrifice a fraction of your total score by getting a hint. I feel like just being told "try using this tactic" would be very helpful on a lot of kata. There's definitely some value in slogging through the mathlib API, it just isn't always fun, and sometimes I spend a LONG time solving an unrelated subgoal that could have been resolved in one line.  I've heard various opinions about how Zulip should be used for codewars problems too. Thoughts?</p>

<p>IMO it should be fine to ask for general hints and tips on this Zulip stream and / or the Discourse of the kata concerned, we can give you hints and general directions as long as it does not immediately spoil the full solution.</p>
