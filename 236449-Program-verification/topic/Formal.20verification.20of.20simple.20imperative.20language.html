<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I have done a translation of the correctness proof in Concrete Semantics with Isabelle/HOL to Lean (well, only the forward direction). I saw before that there was interest in having a similar proof in Mathlib's archive so I'm asking if there is interest in my formalization too. If so I'm willing to put up a PR  (it still depends on LoVelib from Hitchhiker's Guide). The language has addition, boolean expressions, if-statements and while-loops. I haven't put it up on Github yet though.</p>
<p>Edit: I've "removed" the dependency on LoVe Library by copying over the definitions that are necessary. I'm not sure if this is the approach.</p>

<p><code>star</code> is <code>relation.trans_gen</code>. The lemmas about bool, le, and list should either exist or be placed where they should go in mathlib. For the rest, it looks good for the mathlib archive once it is adjusted to mathlib style, although I think you should think about how to turn this into something more reusable so that it can go into mathlib proper</p>

<p>hmm I have mostly thought about this as an example others could study as it is quite specific to a particular compiler. I'm not quite sure in what way it would be reusable by others. What did you have in mind?</p>

<p>Maybe you should just modify your code to follow mathlib conventions and make a pull request. Because this code can't really be made reusable. But it is a very educational example. Be sure to add a docstring mentioning the Logical Verification course!</p>

<p>It's frozen in time. I ported it already to 2021. See <a href="https://github.com/blanchette/logical_verification_2021">https://github.com/blanchette/logical_verification_2021</a> . We don't use much of <code>mathlib</code>; it's easy to port.</p>
