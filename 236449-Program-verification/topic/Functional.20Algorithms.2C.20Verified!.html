<p>A shameless plug for the following Isabelle/HOL-based tutorial, by Nipkow et al. (including one chapter by me): <a href="http://functional-algorithms-verified.org/">Functional Algorithms, Verified!</a>. There was an effort aiming at porting Concrete Semantics by Nipkow &amp; Klein to Lean 3. I thought maybe this new book could have some interesting chapters for Lean 4, where the focus is shifted more towards programming.</p>
