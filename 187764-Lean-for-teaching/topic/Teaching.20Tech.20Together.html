<p>Greg Wilson, who in the software community is known for vocal support of evidence backed development and evidence backed learning has a book called Teaching Tech Together available here: <a href="http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html">http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html</a><br>
It's obviously not Lean specific, but figured I'd share in case others have thoughts on it. I have only just started it, my hope is to read it in the next week or two, but I greatly value Greg's methodologies generally.</p>
