<p>This semester I am teaching an Intro to Proofs course at Johns Hopkins to a mix of first and second year undergraduates and senior high school students. Today we had our install party, and we did some very basic rewrite exercises. </p>
<p>This course takes great inspiration from <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/">Mathematics in Lean</a>  and will be a lot like it, except that in our course functions appear before logic and we do a good deal more abstract algebra, including categories and functors. </p>
<p>If you are or know somebody who is interested in joining this course remotely, there is a Zulip server for this course at <a href="https://introproofs.zulipchat.com/">https://introproofs.zulipchat.com/</a>.  All the course materials can be found on the Zulip server of the course (including link to recorded lectures). If interested, you can DM me and I can send an invite link to this server.</p>
