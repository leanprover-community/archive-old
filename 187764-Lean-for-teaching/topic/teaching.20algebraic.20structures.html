<p>I'm about to introduce my class to groups, rings, and fields. Mathlib's implementations have a lot of noise, for forgetful inheritance reasons. I don't want to introduce my students to this notion yet. So we'll start by defining <code>group</code> on our own, but very quickly I want all the group theorems in mathlib, so we'll have to switch.</p>
<p>How have others dealt with this dissonance? I'll tell them "there are a lot of fields you see when you <code>#print group</code> that you can really just ignore." But it's really ugly, and I don't think there's a clean way to see only the <em>necessary</em> fields of a structure, is there?</p>

<p>If you start with an empty structure <code>{ }</code> the error messages "field ... was not provided" only cover the necessary stuff, which is good. But this isn't a great way to display it and it's annoying to have to go through them one by one.</p>

<p>I absolutely agree with you. I've only dealt with groups in one-off lectures, not in classes, and since the <code>nsmul</code> stuff appeared I've been rolling my own. You even see this problem with <code>preorder</code>, where using the hole command generates <code>lt</code> even though it's <code>:=...</code> and <code>lt_iff_le_not_le</code> even though it's <code>... . order_laws_tac</code>. I would just switch, under the pretence that "we spent an hour proving theorems about groups but clearly we don't want to go through all x thousand lines of code in mathlib about group theory, oh by the way, here's a custom constructor I just made which enables us to make mathlib groups using exactly the same axioms as we used to make those hand-rolled groups last time"</p>

<p>My course was 8 independent short stories. So in the group theory short story I rolled my own groups and subgroups, and then we put them away and never used them again; later on when we needed groups I used mathlib's groups.</p>

<p>I'm ready to handwave it away for now, but some of my students will do math-y final projects and I don't want them to use a handrolled group for that. I trust them to figure it out more or less after I explain the handwaving. But this is a big-ish UI hiccup.</p>

<p>@Rob the mantra I always push is "don't unfold -- use the API", but your audience will be different to mine; probably a bit less scared about computers but also I suspect far happier to take on board the idea that there can be more than one implementation of a structure and that it's not for them to worry about how the devs actually did it as long as they can use it.</p>

<p>Ah, one more question: from your experience, would you recommend having the students be in front of their PC trying to code 100% of the time, or would it be better to have some balance between me showing/coding/teaching "classically" and them trying/coding/getting frustrated?</p>
