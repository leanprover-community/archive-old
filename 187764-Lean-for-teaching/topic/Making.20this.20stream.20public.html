<p>Do you think this stream should be made public? I strongly think it should. Disclaimer: within a few days I will create a thread about how my current course went and if this stream is public I will probably tweet about the thread. But independent of that there is a lot going on right now. There's this thing at the Fields Institute (see recent thread) and this thing at Loughborough (Learning mathematics with Lean thread) and although the Fields Institute thing is supposed to be about theorem provers in general, it is completely dominated by Lean talks. Making this stream public might open the Zulip up to a new crowd some of whom might want to become part of the conversation.</p>
