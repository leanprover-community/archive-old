<p>Hi everyone. I am a student of <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="260507">@Heather Macbeth</span> and I am trying to compile a sphinx repository made by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110865">@Jeremy Avigad</span> (<a href="https://github.com/avigad/mathematics_in_lean_source">https://github.com/avigad/mathematics_in_lean_source</a>) but I am running into a problem. When I build the html files for the project, some of the lean files are not being found through the mkdoc script. Therefore I will get an error such as:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Text only"><pre><span></span><code>source/02_Basics.rst:11: CRITICAL: Problems with "include" directive path:
InputError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'source/02_Basics/01_Calculating.inc'.
</code></pre></div>
<p>I tried fiddling with the mkdoc file and I can get some of the lean file to appear, but then the regular expressions fail to parse some of the lean code and latex. <br>

<p>Hi, Matthew. I am sorry that the process is not well documented. It's not really designed for public use. Improving it and documenting it is on my very long list of things to do.</p>
<p>To build e.g. the html, the following should work, from the top level folder:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">lean_source</span><span class="bp">/</span><span class="n">mkall.sh</span>
<span class="n">make</span> <span class="n">html</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you want the pdf instead, change the second line to <code>make latexpdf</code>. Most of the source material is in the directory <code>lean_source</code>. The first line runs a Python script to generate the Sphinx source, the exercises, and the solutions from the Lean source files.</p>
<p>To start with, you need Sphinx and the readthedocs template:</p>
<p><a href="https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html">https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html</a></p>
<p>Adding a new section requires adding it to the chapter under <code>source</code>, adding it to the list of things to complie in <code>mkall.sh</code>, and then putting the source code in the right place under <code>lean_source</code>.</p>
<p>Adding a new chapter requires creating a new <code>.rst</code> file under <code>source</code>, and adding it to <code>index.rst</code>.</p>
<p>Creating your own textbook follows suit. The file <code>index.rst</code> should list all the chapters, there should be a <code>.rst</code> file under <code>source</code> for each chapter that imports all the sections, there should be a Lean file in <code>lean_source</code> corresponding to each section, and <code>mkall.sh</code> should list all the sections.</p>

<p>P.S. The file <code>README.md</code> is left over from previous incarnations. I'll update it now with the information above.</p>

<p>It's working now, thank you so much for the help.</p>
