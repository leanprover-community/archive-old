<p>I've been reading <a href="https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/lf-current/toc.html">Software Foundations</a>. The authors mention a process for partially automated / partially human-marked assessment of Coq scripts. Does anyone here have knowledge of how that works and/or of how I could do something similar in Lean?</p>
