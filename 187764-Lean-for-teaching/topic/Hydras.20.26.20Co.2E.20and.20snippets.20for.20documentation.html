<p>The camera-ready version of our paper on the "Hydras &amp; Co." project , accepted at JFLA 2022, is now available: <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03404668">https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03404668</a></p>
<p>The project consists of a <a href="https://github.com/coq-community/hydra-battles">Coq repository</a> formalizing the theory of ordinals and other discrete mathematics, and a continuously updated <a href="https://coq-community.org/hydra-battles/doc/hydras.pdf">PDF book</a> that describes both the math and the code.</p>
<p>For the Lean community, we believe our toolchain that allows snippets from "live" proof assistant code  to be executed and be pretty printed with its output using <a href="https://github.com/cpitclaudel/alectryon">Alectryon</a> could be of interest to authors of textbooks. As you may know, Lean already has experimental Alectryon support, and our <a href="https://github.com/coq-community/hydra-battles/tree/master/doc/movies">tooling</a> could be adapted on top of that.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03404668v2/document#page=11">here</a> (Figure 8 in the paper) for a nice example of what snippet-based documentation can look like.</p>
<p>With P. Cast√©ran, J. Damour, C. Pit-Claudel and T. Zimmermann.</p>

<p>Note also that our toolchain was recently used by someone other than the authors to produce <a href="https://gitlab.com/ana-borges/QRC1-Coq/-/blob/ProofSociety/docs/slides/202112_ProofSocietyWorkshop/QRC1-Coq.pdf">slides</a> with Beamer based on code from a "live" Coq development. The corresponding discussion in Coq's Zulip is <a href="https://coq.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/237977-Coq-users/topic/Alectryon.20in.20slides">here</a>.</p>
