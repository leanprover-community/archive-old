<p>Anyone has had success with detecting plagiarism in Lean assignments?<br>
I was thinking that a great aid would be to have Lean output the proof terms constructed by the students using tactic mode, in a way that the output would ignore a student's choice of names.  Any idea how I can get Lean to output this?  (The objective is to detect solutions that are identical up to α-renaming.)</p>

<p>This is a really interesting question, I also am curious if and how anyone has managed this before^</p>

<p>Name-irrelevant content addressing can solve this problem. We are tackling it here: <a href="https://github.com/yatima-inc/yatima-lang/wiki">https://github.com/yatima-inc/yatima-lang/wiki</a></p>

<p>In fact, that part of the stack is already solved. To detect plagiarism between two proofs, one could compare the anon hashes of the respective proof terms.</p>

<p>Is this method defeated by a strategically placed <code>id</code>?</p>

<p>Yes, exact matches between hashes might be too rigid. Maybe a fuzzy match between the respective anon IPLD nodes that we create might work better</p>

</blockquote>
<p>All methods are defeated if the students know what methods you use. That said, some methods are more robust than others (detecting more plagiarism when the students don't know about it).</p>
