<p>I woud like to have tips from people using Lean during courses. I will start a course on discrete mathematics using Lean and I am looking for tools to:</p>
<ol>
<li>assignments and self-grade. GitHub Classroom provides some functionalities, anyone here has used it? Alternatives? Sites like <a href="https://repl.it">https://repl.it</a>?</li>
<li>user-friendly interfaces for the students: many are now very comfortable with notebooks like Jupyter, does anyone tried to make a kernel for Lean in Jupiter?</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li>Not to my knowledge. I'd be happy to help anyone who wanted to start such a project though.</li>

<p>I guess one would first have to decide how to translate the "execution" of Jupyter notebook cells into something compatible with how the Lean server processes Lean files. I played around with embedding Lean in <a href="https://observablehq.com/@bryangingechen/hello-lean-prover?collection=@bryangingechen/lean">a different kind of notebook</a>, but I think a lot more experimentation in this space is needed.</p>

<p>Presumably a good starting point for writing a Lean kernel for Jupyter would be <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span>  and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="115715">@Jason Rute</span> 's <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-client-python"><code>lean-client-python</code></a>.</p>

<p>There is a coq jupyter notebook, might be good to look at that if anyone takes this on.</p>
