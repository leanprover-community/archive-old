<p>I don't think my course counts here.</p>
<p>In a 2nd year course I did very limited experiments, only in a handful of lectures (maybe 10-20% of total lecture time, and given that recorded more standard lectures existed, even this was an obviously optional and experimental component). In particular I did not teach the students any Lean syntax or give them any Lean problems. My main point was that the infoview is a way to follow what is going on in a proof, since this was one of their first exposures to proofs. The students participated, however, by suggesting proof steps in natural language, which I then "translated" to Lean on the spot (at least if they were reasonable), and we saw how the tactic state changed. The following was an example actually done in a lecture towards the end of the course (I was using my custom preliminary lemmas numbered as in my lecture notes, so this will not compile in mathlib, but should give an idea):</p>

<p>In the course feedback questionnaire I asked about the helpfulness of Lean. Very few people had any opinions (very few attended the experimental lectures). The handful who had opinions were polarized: a few said it was very helpful (which probably just meant they enjoyed seeing a new game) and a few said it was very unhelpful. Don't worry, I am stubborn and I have not given up yet... I think the success is very much dependent on the implementation, and mine was a first experiment only.</p>
<p>One implementation issue that I tried but abandoned at the students' request was Observable notebooks such as <a href="https://observablehq.com/@kkytola/metsp2022_lec02">this</a>. They were very slow for using Lean, and typing even ordinary text and math was slow (so I switched to a virtual blackboard). But I think notebooks of this flavor <em>could</em> work very well, with better preparation. I loved <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="123965">@Bryan Gin-ge Chen</span>'s Lean tools for Observable in principle, although I abandoned this format after two lectures, and later only showed Lean in a shared VS Code window.</p>

<p>That's maybe the only idea which worked quite well. Otherwise my implementation requires more than a bit of polishing... (But remote lectures with previous years' lectures recorded did give me freedom to experiment more than usually! I don't think I could have done this if we hadn't been again forced to remote mode by the Omicron surge.)</p>

<p>I also really think the Observable notebooks have potential, because the students can browse them without installing Lean. And they could contain problems. (This time I had other issues.)</p>
