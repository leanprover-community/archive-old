<p>Which version of Lean do you use for teaching? What installation manual do you give your students? Do students often encounter technical obstacles?</p>

<p>So far I teach using Lean 3, and I give them autonomous bundles that can be seen as customized versions of <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html#maybe-a-couple-of-nights">https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html#maybe-a-couple-of-nights</a>  (although technically it's the other way around, the bundles on the website are derived from my teaching setup).</p>

<p>For Logical Verification we use Lean 3 with these installation instructions: <a href="https://github.com/blanchette/logical_verification_2022">https://github.com/blanchette/logical_verification_2022</a> (based on those from the leanprover-community site). A clear majority of students have no technical issues. We also provide a VM, but as far as we know it has gone unused for two years.</p>

<p>Yes (unless, I guess, they already have Python or Git).</p>

<p>Lean 4.  I stick to core and pin it to stable. It makes it painful to incorporate useful facts (like most proofs for int) from either std4 or mathlib4 since those run on nightly but it avoids any breakage of existing code in core.  I assume they will not be installing it on their own machines so provide container config files. We started with just GitPod but now each repository has GitPod and Codespaces config files.  Students seem to generally Codespaces because it is a single click away from the GitHub repository by default. The assignment due today is <a href="https://github.com/UofSC-Fall-2022-Math-300-H01/homework10">https://github.com/UofSC-Fall-2022-Math-300-H01/homework10</a>.</p>
