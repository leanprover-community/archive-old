<p>Is there any way to force the use of braces when there are multiple subgoals, similar to Coq's <code>Set Default Goal Selector "!"</code>?  I find some of my students neglect to use braces and then get completely lost in what part of their proof is supposed to be proving what, and if they'd been forced to use braces from the start they would have a much easier time and develop good habits of structuring their tactics.</p>

<p>According to my reading of <a href="https://coq.inria.fr/refman/proof-engine/ltac.html#goal-selectors">https://coq.inria.fr/refman/proof-engine/ltac.html#goal-selectors</a>, this makes every tactic fail if it is called on a state with multiple goals. Syntactically this could be done by a <code>set_option</code>, but there are a few exceptions which make it difficult to implement generically as part of the glue code holding tactics together: you don't want a proof like</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">example</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">True</span> <span class="bp">/\</span> <span class="n">True</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="kd">by</span>
  <span class="n">constructor</span>
  <span class="bp">.</span> <span class="n">trivial</span>
  <span class="bp">.</span> <span class="n">trivial</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>to fail because the first <code>. trivial</code> was called on a state with two subgoals</p>

<p>To be honest, I've never understood why Coq <em>or</em> Lean even permits unstructured tactic scripts in the first place.  I can understand that maybe it seemed like a good idea decades ago when Coq was first written and now they have a lot of legacy code to support, but why did Lean follow suit?</p>

<p>I can certainly imagine a tactic <code>pretty_smart</code> that looks at 5 goals, of which 2 are real number metavariables, and it figures out which real numbers to assign to those metavariables in such a way that it can prove the other 3 goals.<br>
Such a tactic needs to operate on multiple goals.</p>

<p>The first year I taught using Lean, I explained braces, and after two weeks I promised myself I would hide this piece of syntax to students forever. In principle focusing on one goal is nice. But the huge issue is that Lean 3 gets super confused and displays either nothing or an incomprehensible error message as soon as braces are not balanced or a comma is missing between a closing brace and an opening one.</p>

<p>With the natural number game I just said "tactics act on the top goal" and actively encouraged bad style; I have been in two minds about whether this was a good idea ever since! I think it does make it easier to get started (precisely for the incomprehensible error message reasons Patrick mentioned above -- in testing I had enough trouble with people forgetting commas and this already caused enough problems) but for those that go on to write more lean their code is often hard to read until I teach them out of this bad habit.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112680">@Johan Commelin</span>  I'm not against tactics that operate on multiple goals.  What I object to is tactics that operate on the <em>first</em> goal only but without explicitly focusing on it.</p>

<p>One way to do this that would have pretty uniform impact would be to replace the <code>getMainGoal</code> function with <code>getTheGoal</code> which acts like <code>getMainGoal</code> if the <code>allowUnstructuredProof</code> option is disabled and does your proposed behavior (gets the single goal else fails) when it is enabled</p>

<p>I believe one reason not to ban unstructured proofs by default is that they are sometimes helpful for a first draft that can then be refactored, especially when heavy automation is involved. But that means we could still make them opt-out warnings instead of errors, which is easy to do with a custom linter in Lean 4 minus edge cases I probably didn't think of</p>

<p>To add to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> 's thoughts about their teaching,  completely unstructured proofs are also really helpful to create more interactive learning resources. Been thinking about having a drag'n'drop like feature in our project where the Lean4-code is hidden behind an interface, and for this I'd sometimes wish all (or most) tactics worked without enforcing structure. (Lean4-<code>cases</code> is an example that doesn't really work well without structure (when the new variables should be named), but there's still <code>rcases</code> or even <code>cases'</code> around to avoid it.)</p>

<p>Having a linter telling you how to write nicer code sounds like a good idea though, would love to see that added to the default linters</p>

<p>You can use <code>rename_i</code> for unstructured <code>cases</code> proofs, for what it's worth</p>

<p>Sounds to me a lot like the arguments people make for "dynamic typing"... (-:O</p>
