<p>Today Tobias Nipkow gave a talk including some thought about teaching computer science using Isabelle. Only the last section of his talk was about that topic so I think people interested in teaching can go directly to <a href="https://youtu.be/PAxUO84tUE8?t=3159">https://youtu.be/PAxUO84tUE8?t=3159</a>. Of course this is very much about teaching algorithms and data structures, but I think there is food for thought for mathematics as well.</p>
