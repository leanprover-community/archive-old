<p>I haven't used groups specifically, but in a general sense last semester I found GitHub classroom to be very... unpolished, to be generous, so I wouldn't be surprised if that were the case. A similar thing was true for student rosters, you can't even modify them after a sync with the LMS without blowing a bunch of stuff away.</p>

<p>Asking on the teaching GH discussion board though was helpful in a case or two, if no one knows here you might want to ask there.</p>
