<p>Inspired by <a href="#narrow/stream/113486-announce/topic/High.20School.20ITP.20Workshop.20Instructor.20Needed/near/243622869">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113486-announce/topic/High.20School.20ITP.20Workshop.20Instructor.20Needed/near/243622869</a> I thought I'd write down some thoughts.</p>
<p>It would be difficult for me to be involved in the delivery of material for this, because the dates are weekends, however I do have experience working with this kind of student and would be happy to talk to anyone who is interested in this job about potential ideas. Some things which would probably work well are (1) a natural-number-game-like thing and (2) a discussion of induction including induction on equality (e.g. <a href="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2021/04/03/induction-and-inductive-types/">https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2021/04/03/induction-and-inductive-types/</a> and  <a href="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2021/04/18/induction-on-equality/">https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2021/04/18/induction-on-equality/</a>). Something else which would fit well into this could be an introduction to group theory, up to and including a construction of the Knuth-Bendix confluent rewrite system for group theory a la <a href="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/formalising-mathematics/blob/master/src/week_2/Part_A_groups.lean">https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/formalising-mathematics/blob/master/src/week_2/Part_A_groups.lean</a> , which is a fancy way of saying "make <code>simp</code> solve (a * b) * 1⁻¹⁻¹ * b⁻¹ * (a⁻¹ * a⁻¹⁻¹⁻¹) * a = 1`. Each of these could be run as either one or two sessions I would imagine.</p>

<p>If each of these are short enough to be two sessions each, we'd welcome multiple mini-workshops too! Then we could have one mini-workshop on each of the three weekends (July 3-4, 10-11, 17-18).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="421886">@Monsoon Math Camp</span> I would be very happy to take this up if no one else took it up just yet. I cannot do it on the July 3-4 weekend though.</p>

<p>This is really cool. </p>
<p>Let me shamelessly plug a 5-day, no pre-req class that I and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="252300">@Jalex Stark</span>  taught at <a href="https://www.mathcamp.org/">Canada/USA Mathcamp</a>. That camp had a very similar audience.<br>

Please free to use any of the above notes as you see fit.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these dates are too soon for me to participate. I hope I can help out in a future year.</p>
