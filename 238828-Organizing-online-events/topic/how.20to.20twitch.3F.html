<p>I just did a twitch stream. Notes for others who want to do this for the first time:</p>
<ol>
<li>I used "StreamLabs OBS" which is free and has windows and Mac versions, idk how easy it is to install on linux.</li>
<li>It took me about 30 minutes of fiddling with StreamLabs settings before I was ready to go live. There are many tutorial videos on youtube.</li>
<li>It helps to have a second monitor to do the programming on, so you can use your first monitor to watch twitch chat and deal with admin-y things</li>
<li>If you want Twitch to save a recording of the stream, you have to check a box in your settings before you start</li>
</ol>
