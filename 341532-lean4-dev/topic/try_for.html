<p>I assigned <code>try_for</code> to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="130575">@Siddharth Bhat</span> in Providence thinking it would be a simple tactic, but it turned out to be very complicated and <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/1364">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/1364</a> stalled. What is the status of this feature? Does it need special support from the compiler / interpreter? In short: how do you run programs with a timeout and cancel them later? How does the server handle this (surely it comes up already)?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> Here's the PR which tried to add the feature into the kernel: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/1364">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/1364</a></p>
<p>I didn't have the cycles then to debug what was going wrong with some of the failing test cases [I suspected that perhaps the heartbeat counter was too low, now that we track a heartbeat "accurately". But this guess could be wildly off].</p>
<p>I closed the PR, with the intention of getting back to it post LLVM merge. That's currently dragging on figuring out why the <em>windows</em> build is broken :)</p>
