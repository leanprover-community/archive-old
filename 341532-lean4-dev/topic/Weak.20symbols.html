<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112857">@Leonardo de Moura</span>  at al.</p>
<p>would you mind posting a few more details about the weak symbol project?  I'd like to start looking at it and having a few more details would help me.<br>
Thanks,</p>
<p>Tom</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>Thanks for asking. I see the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find out how to "tell" <code>clang</code> and <code>gcc</code> that we want to use a weak symbol for a function name. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> posted a few links about it, but it would be great to have a solution that works for both <code>clang</code> and <code>gcc</code> in the platforms we care about.</li>
<li>Find out which linker options (if any) we need to use to enable weak symbols.</li>
<li>Create small experiment to ensure the approach works. Examples: a small program with two different .c files that define the same weak symbol, but the final executable contains only one copy of the function.</li>
<li>Write a function in Lean that computes a strong hash for <code>Expr</code>. Recall that each code specialization in Lean is uniquely identified by a <code>Expr</code> that does not contain free variables. We will use the hashcode to name the new function produced by our code specializer. </li>
</ul>
<p>Best,<br>
Leo</p>

<p>The task is to confirm the concrete syntax for enabling weak symbols on the compilers / architectures we target, and make sure that it has the desired effect, such that we can feel safe emitting it in the generated C code.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>That's pretty easy!  Can you just tell me whether we compile the generated code as C or as C++?  My understanding is we emit "C"-like code but C can often be compiled using a c++ compiler and it seems a lot of parts of Lean (including things like the runtime are actually c++).<br>
Depending on which one, I may pick a different approach.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Find out which linker options (if any) we need to use to enable weak symbols</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No linker options required on most "Posix" OSs (Linux/Solaris etc) and up-to-date gcc/clang linkers.  I would have to double-check if something is needed for MSVC but I'm not even sure if we're targeting it right now...?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create small experiment to ensure the approach works</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, I can do that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a function in Lean that computes a strong hash for Expr</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you thinking of something like a recursive sha256 digest of a LCNF function?  That sounds good but this one will probably take me a bit longer than the rest, as I'm not sure if the lean library actually has a sha256 (or similar) hash?</p>
<p>However, I do want to bring up a few possible issue with the last suggestion:</p>
<p>1) Since the hash is very strong and depends on the entire expression, is there a chance we would end up with two different versions of the same function in two different modules if they, for example, had different compilation options/optimizations enabled?</p>
<p>2) This approach will not work for SOs/DLLs; or in general, will break for any form of separate compilation.  <br>
I'm sure you're familiar with it but just for completeness:  Imagine that a lean program says "I want to import a compiled function from an SO"; the whole point is that you <em>don't</em> know the implementation, you only know the signature but without the implementation, you won't be able to know which symbol to bind to.  Typically, one doesn't look for weak symbols in DLLs but I can see it happening for specializations of polymorphic functions.</p>
<p>3) This is related to 2) but a slightly different approach:  Most modern Unix systems support things like "LD_PRELOAD".  This allows the OS to load another library before loading the main executable image.  Since the dynamic linker works "left to right", it will bind to the first symbol it finds.  This allows easy experimentation and "injecting" of e.g. testing or other analysis code into the binary.  <br>
Libraries can use this for things like replacing <code>malloc/free</code> with faster/tracing versions; and e.g. clang/gcc use this mechanism for things like the address, memory and thread sanitizer frameworks.  <br>
The <em>whole point</em> of this mechanism is to replace a function with a different implementation; so clearly the SHA would be different.</p>
<p>I don't know if these usecases are important to you but I would like you to at least tell me a bit more about your view on the above.   However, my understanding is that the Lean compiler already has the ability to import compiled Lean code as a shared object and it this could lead to some breakage.</p>
<p>As such, perhaps we should consider two classes of functions:</p>
<p>"weak", which should be deduplicated (and in which case, their name should be <em>just the SHA</em>, not a "name + SHA + something else, because you are really looking for "content addressability"/functional identity</p>
<p>"strong"/exported symbols, whose names could perhaps be some mangling of the name, the input  and return types?</p>
<p>Anyway, we can discuss this more; once you let me know of the the compilation and whether we want to support MSVC, I'll do the first part quickly.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tom</p>

<p>Both. The generated code is usually treated as C, but it has ifdefs in it so it can be compiled in C++ mode as well</p>

<p>the <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/master/src/include/lean/lean.h">lean.h header</a> is probably where we would set up some macros for the weak attribute that we can apply to generated functions</p>

<p>Two different versions of the same function is okay. We would like to avoid it but it's fine if this happens sometimes, and we should not and cannot rely on deduplication for soundness.</p>
<p>Two versions of the function with different compilation options sounds like a nightmare. I don't think this is a supported configuration.</p>

<p>A specific example of an optimization that would do bad things if we applied it inconsistently is removing unused arguments from a function. If we have already produced .o files for the upstream files then this would probably not be caught at compile time and we would just get UB</p>

<p>I don't see how. At the end of the day you will get a pile of functions, and if some have been deduplicated and you LD_PRELOAD replace it you will also be replacing all the deduplicated copies. If that's not what you wanted, too bad. This isn't supported.</p>

<p>That's one of the examples which explains why we can't guarantee deduplication even if we wanted to. If a specialization has been compiled into two independent dynamically linked libraries, there is nothing we can do to make them have the same address anymore. Same thing if you load an SO into a static executable.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Do you have any source/link for these disclaimers for any of the main C/C++ toolchains (gcc/clang)?  I'd like to read up on it.  <br>
I'm aware that MSVC has potentially multiple incompatible runtimes but that's less of a compiler issue, per se.<br>
I understand care has to be taken when mixing such <code>.o</code>s but have never seen any docs explicitly prohibiting/disclaiming this.  <br>
If this were the case, even loading debug SOs into e.g. a production Lean executable (or, say, into a Python executable built with optimizations on) would cause issues.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I still feel like we're still not understanding each other/I'm not explaining myself properly.  <br>
It's not that important right now so perhaps we can discuss this a bit in person on the call on Friday.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That's one of the examples which explains why we can't guarantee deduplication even if we wanted to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A couple of thoughts: </p>
<p>I am sure you are aware of this so I mention it just for clarity - the "deduplication" still happens.  The (non-hidden) symbols will resolve to the same address:  That's why globals/statics/function statics will have the same address irrespective of which dynamic module you're in.  What doesn't happen is that a duplicate function will still exists in (potentially several) binaries but that's less of an issue; the code will stay cold and likely just paged out by the OS.</p>
<p>But I'm not worried about deduplication in the SO case - I am worried about how to find the symbol in the first place.  I don't know/think this is currently possible in Lean but consider the following scenario:</p>
<p>1) In my SO, have a polymorphic function <code>foo</code><br>
2) The function gets monomophized and then specialized for <code>Nat</code> during the build of the SO (and as such, will be weak and will have a hash in its name)</p>
<p>In an ideal scenario, in order to use the shared library, I would just need the equivalent "declaration" for <code>foo</code> (i.e. without its source) in my executable.</p>
<p>1) I build my executable against this interface (perhaps a module/interface file that Leo alluded to before?)<br>
2) I call <code>foo  3</code>.  But because I don't have the source, I would not be able to find the symbol because I won't be able to generate the hash.</p>
<p>But also, forget about Lean.  It should, ostensibly, be possible to write a SO in lean and then perhaps call it from another language altogether.  Unless we consider the external interface, a change in implementation of the function would break the external API/ABI.</p>
<p>Again, maybe we don't care.  Or, maybe we don't care <em>right now</em>.  Still, sounds like we are effectively discussing at least an informal ABI and so I want to bring these things up.</p>
<p>Hope that makes sense.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>If this were the case, even loading debug SOs into e.g. a production Lean executable (or, say, into a Python executable built with optimizations on) would cause issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most linux toolchains don't explicitly say that these kinds of things are not allowed, but they underspecify what will happen and generally don't put too much emphasis on correctness in the face of such things. In particular, it is a false equivalence to say that just because the behavior is undefined there must be issues. It's quite possible for there not to be issues in the majority of plausible use cases while still not being something the compiler has explicit support for.</p>

<p>I am sure you are aware of this so I mention it just for clarity - the "deduplication" still happens. The (non-hidden) symbols will resolve to the same address: That's why globals/statics/function statics will have the same address irrespective of which dynamic module you're in. What doesn't happen is that a duplicate function will still exists in (potentially several) binaries but that's less of an issue; the code will stay cold and likely just paged out by the OS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is only true if the call to the function is exposed to the linker. If the compiler inlines the function and/or does not give them external linkage then the linker may not be able to find the relocations in order to make them point to the same place.</p>

<p>This is not possible. You would need a custom SO format in order to encode these kinds of properties, and lean already has that - it's the olean file. Loading SOs of unknown provenance is only ever going to work with C FFI style linkage, it will not participate in specialization or other lean-level optimizations.</p>

<p>But also, forget about Lean. It should, ostensibly, be possible to write a SO in lean and then perhaps call it from another language altogether. Unless we consider the external interface, a change in implementation of the function would break the external API/ABI.</p>
<p>Again, maybe we don't care. Or, maybe we don't care right now. Still, sounds like we are effectively discussing at least an informal ABI and so I want to bring these things up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A stable ABI for lean suitable for FFI sounds way out of scope. The lingua franca of FFI is C, and C doesn't have template functions or specialization.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span> It would be great to evaluate the linker's Identical Code Folding: robustness, performance, etc too. BTW, I was expecting the "weak symbol" solution to be simple. If it is not too complicated, I prefer to have our own solution that we fully control.</p>

<p>We should definitely evaluate it first, though for weak symbols we are also dependent on the linker behavior <em>and</em> possibly on the platform behavior as mentioned above. For example, the text I <a href="#narrow/stream/341532-lean4-dev/topic/.5BCompiler.5D.20specialization.20reuse/near/300548693">shared</a> in the other thread seemed to imply that weak symbols may not actually lead to deduplication, though I don't know if that is true.</p>

<p>A slight upside of ICF would be that we can continue to use nice symbol names without hashes, and in fact make them even nicer than right now since every specialization site would use its own symbol name without reuse (or at least reuse limited to the current file). If I understand it correctly, the linker will preserve these symbol names and simply have them point at the same code location.</p>

<p>A good thing in any case is that at least for users we can assume that all Lean code will be linked by the same linker, so if an approach looks good with current lld, it seems improbable that that will change for the worse in the future.</p>

<p>Also interesting part from the mold readme, which is the only other linker I can see us potentially switching to in the future:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similarly, BFD, gold an lld support Identical Comdat Folding (ICF) as yet another size optimization. ICF merges two or more read-only sections that happen to have the same contents and relocations. To do that, we have to find isomorphic subgraphs from larger graphs. I implemented a new algorithm for mold, which is 5x faster than lld to do ICF for Chromium (from 5 seconds to 1 second).</p>

<p>linker's Identical Code Folding</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a good idea!  One thought though - if we fold two different specializations which happen to generate the same code, could this cause any issues with anything to do with "addresses"?  I think lean has an *Ref type, and also allows C/C++ FFI, so I wonder if that could come into play.  (I've not had a chance to read the FFI section of the docs yet, so please forgive my ignorance in this area)</p>

<p>I believe this is the difference between --icf=safe and --icf=all. But I can't think of any reason why we should guarantee that distinct symbols cannot be observed with the same address.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I actually like the hashing approach because it would guard us against (certain) types of ABI breaks and compatibility issues (i.e. what C++ defines at the ODR).  Violations of the ODR are really difficult to catch (and debug) and just lead to undefined behavior.  My discussion with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> is mostly about trying to nail down more of the requirements and get a better understanding of the team's thinking and a potential roadmap in this area.</p>
<p>Also, ICF will only apply when compiling an executable, so we still need a weak symbol story for when linking against SOs.</p>
<p>Finally, if we're concerned about size/linker performance, it's worth considering split dwarf.  For large programs, not constantly loading the massive debug symbol tables from disk cuts on IO significantly and that's a major performance boost for such large programs.</p>

<p>Just stick these into the same directory and then type <code>make</code>.</p>
<p>It will compile four programs, [c, c++] x [clang, gcc]; run all of them and grep out the <code>greeting</code> symbol to show it's weak. </p>
<p>Please LMK if that's what yo had in mind.</p>

<p>ICF applies to any kind of object. While it will not get rid of duplicates across dynamic linking boundaries, some duplication seems acceptable compared to the overhead of going through the GOT.</p>

<p>I just mean that, inadvertently, someone will compile two binaries and link them to Lean and because the symbols will have a hash, they will not be found, rather than being "accidentally" linked.  I think that's good because it stops people from chasing phantom problems.</p>

<p>Weak symbols cannot be <code>static</code> (they need external linkage, which makes sense).  However, the default symbol visibility is set to "hidden", so it doesn't matter!  "weakness" is orthogonal to the GOT/PLT lookup.   See the following example:</p>

<p>I just mean that, inadvertently, someone will compile two binaries and link them to Lean and because the symbols will have a hash, they will not be found, rather than being "accidentally" linked.  I think that's good because it stops people from chasing phantom problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>static</code> prevents accidental linking just as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With weak symbols do we have to pay for indirection even within the same shared library?<br>
With ICF we would keep specializations static like today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weak symbols cannot be <code>static</code> (they need external linkage, which makes sense)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, but what I meant is that with ICF I wouldn't use weak symbols at all.</p>

<p>All good points, and ultimately it's not my call - happy to defer to others.  For the sake of completeness (and something we can perhaps discuss in the meeting), here are a few other thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>icf may not be as portable a weak symbols because not all target platform linkers may not support it (Especially with LLVM on the way)</li>
<li>gcc documents that its icf is behaviorally different from gold's.  Not sure if that could lead to issues (see here: <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html">https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html</a>)</li>
<li>I'm not 100% sure of the impact of ICF on debug symbols (and perhaps stack traces), but I've heard of some issues (which may have been fixed now).  I also cannot say anything about ICF behavior on MSVC, I have no experience there.</li>
<li>(This now enters speculation area on my part so please treat with a pinch of salt).  You suggested <code>icf=safe</code> (so I assume you're referring to gold).  However, the docs say that it will only fold functions whose address is not taken.  My understanding of instances is they are effectively just dictionaries of function pointers; could this lead to issues with functions not getting folded?</li>
</ul>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="515083">@Tom</span> Do you think you could make an example using ICF and comparing results to the weak symbol example above?</p>

<p>Sure, and let me create an example when both are useful <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>
<p>But in summary of the discussion today:  It seemed we were lean-ing (ha!) toward using my suggestion of using both weak symbols and then enabling folding, too, because it gives the compiler more control and is not completely reliant on the implementation details of the various linkers.  Please LMK if I misunderstood.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>I deliberately designed the test so you get both equality (in the case of weak symbols) and structural equivalence (two structurally equivalent  -but nominally different - functions/types.</p>
<p>1) Weak symbols work in all cases<br>
2) gcc's code folding doesn't do anything in this case (even if the symbols are both weak or if the structures are actually structurally equivalent - I tried both)<br>
3) gcc with gold + safe will fold the code, but switches off in the case when the addresses are used (as per the docs)<br>
4) gcc with gold + all works as expected - the code is always folded</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> - any thoughts on the example above?  Does that satisfy what you were looking for?  It'll be easier for me to make any adjustments on the weekend rather than during the week so if there's anything that's not clear, please LMK and I can try to have it ready at least prior to the meeting tomorrow.  Thanks!</p>

<p>It should, assuming we only build with gcc/clang and a recent version of binutils.</p>
<p>However, my understanding of the point of the example your were looking for was to contrast weak symbols and linker folding, so in this case it didn't seem to matter if it's portable or not.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What would that mean here?  Just looking at the resulting Lean binary code size?  </p>
<p>Or is there a collection of benchmarks I can run?  I don't see how this would meaningfully affect runtime performance unless we're looking at some very minor i-cache behaviors which I find unlikely.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>What do you mean?  "Turn it on for code generated by lean"?  Turn it for the lean compiler itself (I assume you mean for stage 1?  Stage 0 seems to have a lot of C++ code and I think enabling that there would lead to problems.</p>

<p>I'm confused by that statement.  </p>
<p>If stage 0 contains a lot of C++ code (and it does - it seems to be e.g. using the C++ standard library; std::string etc) I would strongly consider <strong>avoiding</strong> linker folding, as I've mentioned in previous conversations.</p>
<p>If C code generated by the Lean codegen only creates "C" functions without relying on e.g. C++ templates and the standard library, then I think we are potentially in safe territory (modulo any address comparisons but you and others have said not to worry about it) and we should feel ok about turning this flag on for such binaries.</p>
<p>Which one are we talking about here?</p>

<p>In which case I would just eschew the experiment.</p>
<p>There is a documented history of problems in C++ when enabling linker folding.  MSVC, for one, did it a while back and had to roll back the changes because it broke people's code.  This is what I've been concerned about all along.</p>
<p>Since C++ can always assume that pointer and object identities are preserved between different instantiations of types and functions - and parts of the compiler depend on C++ - I don't see how we can enable it.</p>
<p>Even though it may work <em>today</em>, when you e.g. update the compiler (or its standard library) something might break.  Even more so, now that LLVM is being pulled in, I don't think we can make any claims about the validity of any linker folding as the LLVM implementation could change in arbitrary ways; and part of the problem is that the breakage may well be silent, which seems highly undesirable.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="515083">@Tom</span> Unlike MSVC, we're not trying to defend against issues in arbitrary code, only in the lean implementation. I assert that the issues you are worrying about don't occur in that code because you need to write contrived code to hit the issue, and the lean implementation doesn't do that. This isn't an issue of depending on UB that could break our code in the future - as long as we don't use pointer identity of template functions (which, again, why would one ever think that is okay?) then we're fine AFAICT.</p>
<p>The only way to find out if it's an issue <em>in practice</em> is to do the experiment, and audit the code to be sure that none of those issues might pop up in the future. It's not a black box or something users can extend, so we can just double check that the crazy code you are talking about doesn't happen.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> AFAIU, Tom is arguing arguing that though Lean4 contains no contrived code, some dependency of Lean4 (eg. GMP, LLVM) very well may contain contrived code. Thus, turning on linker folding could cause bugs in a <em>dependency</em> of the Lean compiler (eg. LLVM). Furthermore, this bug could be <em>silent</em> (are we confident that our tests will uncover such a bug?)</p>

<p>We aren't trying to support arbitrary C++ in lean programs. We're trying to support the C++ in the lean core, plus an open-ended amount of lean-generated C code using very particular patterns.

<p>You could say the same thing about linking assembly code - you <em>could</em> link assembly, and there are a ton of observable things that the compiler will stomp all over in that code. If you do that the consequences are on you. I don't see that as a reason to scale back optimizations as long as <em>lean</em> code avoids the issue by construction.</p>

<p>That does seem crazy to me. Comparing function pointers for equality is a fundamentally suspicious operation. The only direction that makes sense to me is that if two function pointers compare equal then calling one is equivalent to calling the other, although even this is suspicious because of pointer provenance. You have to be writing some really sketchy code for this question to even arise.</p>

<p>I'm interested to see ICF first because by all accounts it's a much simpler thing to do, just flipping a switch somewhere. I don't think that the two approaches are in opposition.

<p>I think you misunderstood what I mean by "threat" here. There is some threat / danger that we will have written a bug and that the bug will go undetected. We are trying to assess the risk here, and my point is that the <em>first step</em> is to gather data by doing the most aggressive version of everything in a test and seeing what that unearths. If nothing shows up and the numbers look good then it will already be within our usual margin of error. We do a fair bit of testing on users anyway so it isn't the end of the world if an issue comes up in one of the dependent projects and we have to re-evaluate. And if nothing shows up even then, I think we're golden.</p>
<p>The not-useful direction is to say that because the possibility of a bug persists, we had best avoid the path altogether, because more testing, more auditing, more anything isn't going to eliminate that possibility completely. There is <em>always</em> the possibility of bugs as long as lean remains formally unverified, which is why we have procedures to mitigate the risk and proceed anyway, and backpedal later if it turned out not to be a good idea.</p>

<p>It's worse than I thought - the C++ standard is worded ambiguously on this point. Here's a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26533740/do-distinct-functions-have-distinct-addresses">SO post</a> where people argue over what it means. My reading is that it's legal to put different functions in the same place, and have <code>==</code> do pointer equality, since the wording says that function pointers should compare equal if they have the same address but this is satisfied in this case. However, this is a change to the observable behavior of the program, and that's what the <code>icf=safe</code> vs <code>icf=all</code> thing is about.</p>

<p>No, I don't think so - I understand your points, I was asking for a change in rhetoric.  I have for example not characterized your ideas as being e.g. "cavalier" because you want to turn everything up to 11 and then see what breaks.  It's just a difference in world view.<br>

<p>Ok, I don't want this to stray too far from the topic at hand but my reading of 7.6.10 point 3 implies this:</p>
<p>“ - Otherwise, if the pointers are both null, both point to the same function, or both represent the same address (6.8.2), they compare equal.</p>
<p>— Otherwise, the pointers compare unequal.<br>
”</p>
<p>I don't want to go down the road of giving the subsequents statements of what "same function" etc means.  I have also reached out to a few of my friends on the committee to get some additional input.  I don't think this blocks the progress thought; I'll let you know what they say.</p>

<p>Fwiw, I don't mind being conservative and choosing <code>--icf=safe</code> if there isn't a large binary size difference to <code>all</code>. And I don't mind the weak symbols approach either, in which case ICF savings might be small enough to not justify the additional (linker) effort.</p>

<p>As an aside, I've heard back from some of the people I know that are on the committee/deep in the C++ world and the consensus is that the intent is that distinct functions do, in fact, keep distinct addresses.  <br>
I have a couple of additional "gems", just for general interest:</p>
<p>1) If you enable <code>-flto</code>, in the case when the compiler previously returned "true" for the function identity equality, it will actually go back and "fix it up" to ensure they actually no longer compare equal!<br>
2) There is a defect report (DR1400) that is supposed to specifically address this issue and I feel the wording does clarify <br>
3) This also seems to have been such an issue that some compilers will generate/fold the two functions and just pad one of them with a bunch of <code>nop</code>s to give them distinct addresses despite the code being "the same".  You can test it using the code/makefile I provided above but you may also need to mark <code>reduceX/Y</code> as <code>[[gnu::noinline]]</code> to ensure the LTO doesn't just inline everything <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>

<p>Huh, looks like the binary actually got smaller, i.e. <code>--icf=all</code> was able to remove more code than deactivating the specialization cache added</p>

<p>I didn't try pushing a PR before testing locally, largely because I'm still trying to get to grips with the build system.  There seems to be multiple layers (I read the bootstrapping doc) but also <code>leanc</code> appears to be involved.  After a few failed attempts this is what I came up with:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">cmake</span> <span class="bp">-</span><span class="n">DLEAN_EXTRA_CXX_FLAGS</span><span class="bp">=</span><span class="s2">"-ffunction-sections"</span> <span class="bp">-</span><span class="n">DLEAN_EXTRA_LINKER_FLAGS</span><span class="bp">=</span><span class="s2">"-fuse-ld=gold -Wl,--icf=all"</span> <span class="bp">-</span><span class="n">DLEANSHARED_LINKER_FLAGS</span><span class="bp">=</span><span class="s2">"-fuse-ld=gold -Wl,--icf=all"</span> <span class="bp">../..</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I looked at the linking step for <code>libleanshared.so</code> and I saw the options seemed correct.</p>
<p>I can look at your PR later to see what you've done but if you have any comments on the above/could tell me what I'm doing wrong, that would also help me learn a bit more about the build process.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><code>LEAN_EXTRA_LINKER_FLAGS</code> should subsume <code>LEANSHARED_LINKER_FLAGS</code>. And <code>LEAN_EXTRA_CXX_FLAGS</code> is not really relevant as the C++ code doesn't matter here, you'll want <code>LEANC_EXTRA_FLAGS</code> like in the PR</p>

<p>I had originally tried that and couldn't get them to appear on the <code>leanc.sh</code> command line for stage1 until I added <code>LEANSHARED_LINKER_FLAGS</code>.  It's possible I made a mistake (at that point I had already been at this for a long time) but that wasn't my experience.</p>

<p>So here's my preliminary analysis of these numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just adding <code>-fdata-section -ffunction-sections -Wl,--gc-sections</code> reduces tests/compiler binaries by 37% on average, so we should just make it the default immediately imo. No effect on Lean itself as explained above.</li>
<li><code>--icf=safe/all</code> reduces <a href="http://libleanshared.so">libleanshared.so</a> by 0%/10% and tests/compiler by another 6%/7%. <code>safe</code> not affecting leanshared at all may be explained by the fact that folding exported symbols in a shared library is unsafe, and we export <em>all</em> functions except for initializers. A semi-conservative choice might be to use <code>safe</code> for linking Lean user binaries, as we don't know what else they might be statically linking against, but <code>all</code> for linking leanshared as we assume there's no sufficiently crazy C++ code in there, and we want to reduce it in the future anyway.</li>
<li>Finally, disabling the specialization cache cross-module incurs an unavoidable overhead of 12% compilation time, 4% total build time, and 13% C lines. Which is not great, but might be tolerable in exchange for better separate compilation. The leanshared binary size increases by 14%, which icf=all manages to get down to -2%, i.e. it was able to negate some but not all of the increase compared to the 10% savings in the previous bullet point.</li>
</ul>

<p>Frankly I'm surprised ICF is that effective. Because it definitely can't fold <em>any</em> function that had a closed term extracted, as that leads to a unique global mutable variable the linker definitely can't fold away. What I don't know is whether this would improve with <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/467">https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/issues/467</a> - is the linker able to fold identical <code>.rodata</code> sections?</p>

<p>Wow, thanks for trying that and the write up!  Very interesting numbers.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>That's exactly what I had in mind in the ongoing discussion above</p>
<blockquote>
<p>folding exported symbols in a shared library is unsafe</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this boils down to the argument about function identity</p>
<p>I want to revisit another idea I threw out in the beginning:  What if we used weak functions <em>but</em> only named the implementation using the content addressable hash?  That way we could actually control what gets folded and would not be beholden to the linker doing a "good job".  It's also not going to fall afaul of any C++/linking rules.  One of the objections was the introduction of "non-human" understandable symbols but the Posix toolchains actually provide a capability for symbol aliases.  So, perhaps we could have two symbols: In the code we would invoke the "named" ones - while giving the linker the ability to fully fold the "hashed" weak ones.</p>

<p>I'm not sure anymore if the symbol name is a big issue - we most often see them in stack traces, in which case any kind of folding will basically show a random representative. So as long as the specialized function itself is still included in the symbol name, it's probably fine.</p>

<p>Nice, looks good. So can we rely on gdb/backtrace()/... showing the alias symbol name instead of the original? And folding of weak symbols still works I assume?</p>

<p>Just adding -fdata-section -ffunction-sections -Wl,--gc-sections reduces tests/compiler binaries by 37% on average, so we should just make it the default immediately imo. No effect on Lean itself as explained above.</p>

<p>For the record, at the end of today's meeting we decided that while these experiments were extremely informative, especially for any future work in this direction, at this point we want to keep the deduplication in the compiler, not move it to the linker. We can revisit the topic when it seems likely that we would save more time from improved separate compilation than we lose on redundant compilation.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="515083">@Tom</span> You had more remarks in the chat that we didn't manage to get back to in the meeting, do you want to continue the discussion here so it doesn't get lost? I think you mentioned the "key" that we would use for deduplication. My assumption was that we would keep the current key, which <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/e338d9879a21a5043a5e4fc012abb38550171c2a/src/Lean/Compiler/Specialize.lean#L92">is</a> the full application of the specialized function (just possibly hashed) regardless of where deduplication happens.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110024">@Sebastian Ullrich</span> ,</p>
<p>Thanks for the follow up.  I am happy to leave things as they are for now; the weak symbol project seemed like a good place for me because it would allow me to contribute (and learn more about LCNF e.g. to generate the hashes).  However, if the current decision is to move on, I am not married to it and I don't think I'll forget what we've discussed here.  So, it's really up to you and the other more experienced devs here to help set the direction because I don't know enough yet to be able to decide one way or another.</p>
<p>It seems some of the discussion around separate compilation and modules is related - and quite interesting -  so perhaps this will come up again sooner rather than later.  It might be interesting to look at the C++ module system design because I see a lot similarities coming up so the experience and practical aspects may be enlightening  :  Separate compilation vs graph-based dependencies; specializations/weak symbols and templates being defined and exported by modules etc. etc.</p>
<p>If you're interested in carrying on, or finishing off some of the details, LMK.  In the meantime, I'm happy to move on.  I have plenty to occupy myself with in terms of simultaneously trying to learn the language, the compiler internals etc etc.  If something comes to mind, please don't hesitate to reach out.</p>
<p>Tom</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="515083">@Tom</span> I haven't looked at C++ modules at all yet (except for a few dunks on it on Twitter I believe...), do you know of a good write-up of it regarding separate compilations?</p>
