<p>I need some Nix help to figure out why the new monad documentation is <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/monads/functors.lean.html">not building properly</a>.  I'm looking at doc/flake.nix, seems "examples" folder is handled specially, so perhaps I need to add <code>monads = renderDir "monads" ./monads;</code>, but I don't understand why <code>renderLean</code> is making an examples folder, perhaps that needs to be a variable name?  Another special think seems to be on line 43 with <code>cp -r ${examples}/* examples/</code> which I don't understand, and I don't understand why <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/blob/master/doc/examples/palindromes.lean.md">boiler plate *.lean.md files</a> have to be checked in, is this also a Nix thing?  Anyway, I would love to have this cleaned up and generalized by a Nix expert so that there is no special-casing and we can leaninkify any new folder in the future without having to touch this file.</p>

<p>Okay, I've generalized it to build all .lean files in <code>doc/</code>. Which is way more than are actually reachable from the manual (see <code>NFM2022/</code>), but it's a matter of a few seconds of overhead.</p>

<p>As I said before, it is purely for the benefit of building the docs without LeanInk</p>

<p>It also solves <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/LeanInk/issues/24">https://github.com/leanprover/LeanInk/issues/24</a> in a roundabout way now that I remember</p>

<p>Thanks for fixing it.  <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/monads/functors.lean.html">https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/monads/functors.lean.html</a> looks good now.</p>
<p>Note that <code>mdbook build</code> works fine without the *.lean.md stub files, you just get blank pages there instead which is fine for those who don't want to use leanink.</p>
