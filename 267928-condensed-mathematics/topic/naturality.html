<p>If I'm not mistaken, if <code>ùìê</code> is an abelian category, then <code>arrow ùìê</code> is also an abelian category. I think this means that if we formulate constructions just for objects, but in a random abelian category, then we might be able to get naturality for free by applying the construction to <code>arrow.mk f</code>. E.g. the naturality of the snake Œ¥, etc...<br>
Not saying this is a useful trick right now for LTE. But it's just a thought that occured to me.</p>

<p>Ah, this is a neat idea! I wasn't aware of this argument.</p>

<p>I guess you need to verify that the construction is "functorial" on objects. But that might just be defeq, if we're lucky/careful.</p>

<p>Yeah I thought about something like this as well (when I was working on naturality of the $$\delta$$s), but I don't think this buys you a free lunch. It probably just means you need to prove that some functors commute with the two projection functors from <code>arrow</code>, and the proofs probably end up being similar to proving naturality anyway.</p>
