<p>A general remark about <code>exact_seq</code>. I've come to realise that it's often useful to prove lemmas about <code>(f :: g :: L)</code>, where <code>L</code> is an arbitrary list of arrows. That way you can write things like <code>(hL.drop 3).pair</code>. It's slightly more efficient than using <code>extract</code>.</p>
