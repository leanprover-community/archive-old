<p>What am I doing wrong? I've not looked at this project for a while and I'm now updating it on several computers. I'm on master. I do <code>git pull</code> which works fine, then <code>leanproject get-m</code> fails with</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Lean"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">SHA</span> <span class="n">b'8174bd071fddb63d1b31ea61094342a936fa106d'</span> <span class="n">could</span> <span class="n">not</span> <span class="n">be</span> <span class="n">resolved</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">returned</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">b'8174bd071fddb63d1b31ea61094342a936fa106d</span> <span class="n">missing'</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>so I try <code>leanproject build</code> and this I think changes the mathlib in <code>_target</code> to the commit listed in <code>leanpkg.toml</code>, and then it starts building mathlib from scratch, so I break out of this and type <code>leanproject get-m</code> and now this works (getting cache <code>8174bd071f</code>, a completely different commit) and now I can build. Hmm, I've just noticed I'm not on leanproject 1.1.0 on this computer, maybe this has something to do with it; but I don't know <em>anything</em> about python and can never remember how to upgrade leanproject. Why can't I just do <code>leanproject upgrade</code> like I can do with e.g. elan? &lt;/rant&gt;</p>
