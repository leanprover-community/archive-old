<p>I just created an issue to track this todo. From the issue page <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid/issues/73">https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid/issues/73</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first paragraph of the proof reduces the claim to the case of finite S. This reduction step is not yet formalized. The finite case is done.</p>
<p>The challenge is to connect explicit constructions (such as fin n â†’ M) to abstract categorical constructions (n-fold categorical product of M with itself).</p>
<p>After such connections are made, the rest of the proof should be straightforward applications of general facts from mathlib.</p>

<p>I've pushed the statement to <code>src/combinatorial_lemma/profinite.lean</code>. Anyone looking for a small and self-contained bite of applied category to work can look here.</p>
