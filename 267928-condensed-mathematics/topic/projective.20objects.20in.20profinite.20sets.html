<p>I'm just posting a pointer to this file in a pretty old repo:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/condensed-sets/blob/master/src/extremally_disconnected.lean">https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/condensed-sets/blob/master/src/extremally_disconnected.lean</a></p>
<p>In the near future we'll want to know that extremally disconnected sets are the profinite objects in profinite sets. This file contains one direction.</p>

<p>Do we have profinite objects in arbitrary categories? <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="260921">@Markus Himmel</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> ?</p>

<p>You mean the <em>projective</em> objects</p>

<p>Ooops... to many "pro"words. Edit: fixed.</p>

<p>Projective objects are defined in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7108">#7108</a>, but there isn't any API yet for actually working with them.</p>

<p>Projective modules are in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/6813">#6813</a> which is on the queue, and a first natural test will be to see whether these two PRs can interact fruitfully.</p>
<p>For the mathlib community one huge benefit of projects like this is that it has given us a lot of motivation to actually make stuff like projective objects and modules, and I'm really pleased about this because it conforms to my motto of driving mathlib towards interesting mathematics, which is the only way that software like this is going to be taken seriously by mathematicians in general.</p>

<p>There is also the WIP <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7113">#7113</a>, which is the beginning of the experiment to see if they glue together well.</p>
