<p>I did some cleanup of <code>for_mathlib/split_exact.lean</code>, in the hope of actually, you know, putting it in mathlib. :-) Mostly it is was already in great shape. However there is a <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid/blob/master/src/for_mathlib/split_exact.lean#L358">TODO</a> that I don't understand:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-- TODO: this should be generalized to isoms of short sequences,<br>
-- because now it forces one direction, and we want both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could someone explain this to me?'</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> I think the point is that instead of a map <code>i : B \hom A \b+ C</code> you could also have a map <code>A \b+ C \hom B</code> instead.</p>

<p>But how do "isoms of short sequences" come into it?</p>

<p>Not so sure what I was thinking when I wrote that comment.</p>

<p>Maybe what I really meant is that we should also have the "dual" constructor.</p>

<p>Ooh, maybe if you have a <code>f' g'</code> and some isomorphisms, then you get <code>short_exact f g \iff short_exact f' g'</code>. Maybe I was thinking of that statement.</p>

<p>I PR'd <code>short_exact</code> as <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/14009">#14009</a>. Reviews/merges welcome. :-)</p>

<p>Maybe I'll aim at <code>for_mathlib/exact_seq.lean</code> when I want to do more for_mathlibbing. That one looks close to ready.</p>
