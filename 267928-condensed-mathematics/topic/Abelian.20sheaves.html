<p>We will need a way to go back and forth between abelian group objects in <code>CondensedType</code> and <code>Condensed Ab</code>.<br>
I made some initial definitions along these lines here:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid/blob/master/src/for_mathlib/abelian_group_object.lean">https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid/blob/master/src/for_mathlib/abelian_group_object.lean</a></p>
<p>There are a few sorry's about proving certain presheaves are sheaves. <br>
I think it's important to use explicit products and terminal objects here, so we can feed them into the monoidal category constructor and not have to deal with the trouble of going back and forth between the category theoretic product in the category <code>Type*</code> and the usual type-theoretic product.</p>

<p>But since they are now structures instead of classes, they are probably more useful, because more explicit. And it gives us dot-notation, etc...</p>

<p>For example I'm pretty sure that we could remove all the <code>import deprecated.*</code> from mathlib, if someone could be bothered. I just got tired of it, I pushed the imports much further down the tree but couldn't quite face finishing the job.</p>

<p>well, the cokernels in sheaves involved sheafification, so it's a little more complicated to obtain the isomorphism theorem for sheaves.</p>

<p>Okay, so there is an actual hangup -- we need the fact that sheafification is left exact (in the sense that it preserves finite limits). This follows from the fact that finite limits commute with filtered colimits in <code>Type*</code> (and hence any of the concrete categories we have around in the context of sheafification), but it will require some more serious work to actually get this result.</p>

<p>By pullback I meant the inverse image functor. Not the categorical one.<br>
I'm looking for the left-exactness of the pullback functor, of which the left-exact-ness of sheafification is the final piece missing.<br>
Not that I'll need this result right now though. There's still plenty of things to push into mathlib before I could use it to do more stuff.</p>
