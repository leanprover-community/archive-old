<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="243562">@Adam Topaz</span> I have been snowed under with teaching recently. I am trying to pick up some pieces. A couple of months ago before it all hit wasn't I working on some category theory statement of the form "if it works for initial objects and binary products then it works for finite products". I'm pretty sure I never finished it. I'm wondering whether I should pick it up as an example in my course</p>

<p>I finished it off a few weeks ago ;)</p>

<p>Many thanks! IIRC I was struggling (read : learning a lot about how to do category theory in Lean) even with the simple way.</p>

<p>The argument is not ideal… we have <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/category_theory/limits/constructions/finite_products_of_binary_products.html#category_theory.preserves_finite_products_of_preserves_binary_and_terminal">https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/category_theory/limits/constructions/finite_products_of_binary_products.html#category_theory.preserves_finite_products_of_preserves_binary_and_terminal</a> which should have given this to us for “free”, except that the universes don’t quite match. Maybe someone with more energy than I have could generalize the universes there…</p>

<p>In any case, I did use a variant of <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/fintype.induction_empty_option">docs#fintype.induction_empty_option</a> which worked out quite well!</p>
