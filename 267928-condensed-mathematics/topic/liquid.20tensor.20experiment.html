<p><a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid">https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid</a> together with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="243562">@Adam Topaz</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> I've worked on formalizing the statement that is the goal of the Liquid Tensor Experiment (<a href="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2020/12/05/liquid-tensor-experiment/">https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2020/12/05/liquid-tensor-experiment/</a>).<br>
The main source for this project is <a href="http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/scholze/Analytic.pdf">http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/scholze/Analytic.pdf</a> .</p>
<p>I can now say that I'm confident that we can make this project happen. Succesful completion of this project would be a major success story for mathlib and its community.</p>
<p>As I see it, there are two independent strands that can be worked on:</p>
<ol>
<li>The proof of theorem 9.4 (the statement that is formalized in the repo I linked to above).</li>
<li>
<p>Theorem 9.4 is a crucial building block in setting up liquid/condensed maths. If you want to flex your categorical mathlib muscles, it would be very interesting to build the category of solid modules, and state theorem 6.5.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once that is done, we can start working on connecting 6.5 and 9.4. But that is certainly something that should be postponed for the time being.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>The proof of 9.4 (so, part 1) contains a lot of calculations with normed abelian groups, and inequalities between norms of elements living in complexes of normed abelian groups. So if your background is functional analysis instead of p-adic geometry, please join forces with us!</p>

<p>I agree. I think that there are quite a lot of people in a position similar to mine: we are ready to contribute, but we do not know how to start for such a huge project and we need some guidance.  I am not saying you should coordinate people (that requires a lot of effort and it is probably not that interesting),  just that in a dream world there would be a list of stuff to be done, and we can start working on the easiest. Of course it is super interesting just to read what you have done and play with it.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> The proof of 9.4, that is the main focus right now, is essentially completely contained in Lecture 9 and its appendix in <a href="http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/scholze/Analytic.pdf">www.math.uni-bonn.de/people/scholze/Analytic.pdf</a> ; I think there is almost no backwards referencing (one thing that is relevant is the second appendix to Lecture 8, on completions of normed abelian groups). So everybody who wants to contribute can concentrate on that part.  I think each Lemma that is stated (e.g. 9.7 and 9.8) is something that one can work on.</p>

<p>Say you want to travel from A to B. The convex solution is to just take your car: The cost (as say measured in time) scales pretty much linearly in the distance, and you will simply take the shortest route. If you look at the region you can reach in a given time, you get some convex region -- essentially a circle. The nonconvex solution is to first walk to the bus station, then take the bus to the train station, then take the train to the airport, then fly, and finally reverse those steps. The set of points you can reach via this method in a given time is highly nonconvex.</p>

<p>Peter, a vague idea that floats in my mind is that a baby case of what you are describing is what happens in tropical geometry, where you convert a (usually non-linear) algebraic variety to a piecewise linear combinatorial structure.  The connection happens via valued fields.</p>
<p>I also remember going to a talk (for which I can try to remember more details, if there is the need), where tropical geometry was applied to solve (or at least change) some differential equation into a combinatorial problem.</p>

<p>I kind of view the data of tropical geometry as being packaged by piecewise linear (piecewise convex, in this context) information.  From the point of view of algebraic geometry, tropical geometry is <em>very</em> linear!</p>

<p>I can see that, but I also remember that a "line" is a tripod!  So, linear outside of tropical geometry becomes piecewise linear, but the language allows you to treat is as "more linear than you would imagine"!</p>

<p>Anyway, I intuitively think of tropical geometry as a "first-order approximation" to algebraic geometry and, when you look at it like this, you can see a resemblance of linearity.  The valued fields are really key to this.</p>

<p>I find this genuinely confusing, I was sure that after extracting this kind of "big picture idea" I would finally be able to connect this stuff to what other people are doing over the reals. But it just seems to be different... but coming from the condensed perspective, there's literally nothing else one might be doing over the reals!</p>
