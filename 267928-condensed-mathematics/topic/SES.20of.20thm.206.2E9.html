<p>I am getting closer to finishing the proof of Theorem 6.9 for finite <code>S</code>. Is there already a place where it is <em>used</em> in some form (I guess, either inserted in some homological machinery to extract a LES or in some limit machinery to deduce the SES for profinite <code>S</code>)? I would like to make sure that my final statement will match the required formulation.</p>

<p>No, I don't think it's used yet. So we can adapt the application to what ever final form you come up with (-;</p>

<p>Ok, good to know. I guess at any rate it will be needed in a correct categorial form; do we know that <code>CompHausFilteredblah</code> (the category containing both real and Laurent measures) is abelian?</p>

<p>No, it's not abelian, if I recall correctly.</p>

<p>And for silly reasons: if you take the identity map <code>M â†’ M</code> but you rescale the filtration on one of the two <code>M</code>s, then the <code>id</code> might still be a hom, but clearly not an iso.</p>

<p>You can only scale in the correct direction of course. Because the filtration has to be preserved.</p>

<p>So really, we'll have to push the sequence to <code>Cond(Ab)</code> and start reasoning there.</p>

<p>OK; so we need to take the limit to get to profinite S. But can we say at least it is a sequence (is the category exact)?</p>

<p>Perhaps the best would be if I look more carefully at what the state of the art of the other files is, to see how much category language I can use to express its exactness...</p>

<p>The category <code>CompHausFilt_1</code> may actually be abelian (or close to it).... I'm not sure.</p>
<p><del>Well.... it's probably not abelian (I think colimits would pose an issue), but</del> certainly limits are well behaved in there.</p>
<p>Maybe it's abelian... I should stop guessing until after I have some coffee.</p>

<p>Well, to be honest my question about it being abelian was too much. For the time being I care about being able to write exact sequences (does having zero objects suffice?) and taking limits to pass to profinite sets.</p>

<p>I am very close to a "brutal" version of exactness (I can check that the RHS is surjective and the LHS is injective and that if something goes to 0 under the right map it is in the image of the first) and I am wondering how to translate it in fancy terms that we can give to a colimit functor to produce the nice SES in <code>Cond Ab</code>.</p>

<p>To take a limit, you would need to work in <code>CompHausFilt_1</code>. The category without the <code>1</code> does not have limits (for essentially the reason that Johan mentioned above).</p>

<p>OK, so I need to show that my two morphisms are <code>CompHausFilt_1</code>-morphisms. But has <code>CompHausFilt_1</code> kernels, zero and cokernels so that I can state my ES is a SES (and do mono/epi coincide with set-theoretic injections/surjections)?</p>
