<p>I like that we have some notation for <code>by exactI</code>, but can we change it from a zero-width space to something more reasonable? We could use an English word that hasn't much meaning by itself, like <code>now</code>, <code>so</code>, <code>thus</code>? (though none of these quite sound right in the places we want)</p>

<p>If you can think of a fitting english word that is more reasonable than <code>by exactI</code>, I'm all for it.</p>

<p>Also, I think it's fine to just write <code>by exactI</code> almost everywhere.<br>
I just wanted to avoid in the main statements, because there it's very distracting for outsiders that are reading their first lean code.</p>

<p>after the <code>,</code> of an <code>\exists</code> we could write <code>such_that</code>... but that doesn't fit very well after the <code>,</code> of <code>\forall</code>.<br>
Of course we could have two new symbols.</p>

<p>You could also write it such that you don't need <code>by exactI</code>...</p>
