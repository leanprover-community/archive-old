<p>What is the best way to say that a <code>presieve</code> consists of finitely many maps that are jointly surjective?</p>

<p>The discord is far less serious than this place, it's mostly undergraduates, there's a bunch of other stuff going on (chess, among us, memes), for me the most interesting thing is the live streaming events -- this is the one edge it has over Zulip. A lot of the time when I'm working on Lean I just live stream (often with music on) and people watch and ask questions, and others (Bhavik, Kenny) live stream too. We made it private because we didn't want to have to police the site 24/7, but I'll happily give out invites to people who fit the bill (undergraduate mathematicians with an interest in Lean fit it 100%, and people who don't diverge too radically from that profile are often also welcome).</p>

<p>So maybe there's no harm to just using <code>fintype</code> and having a proper class of covering families</p>
