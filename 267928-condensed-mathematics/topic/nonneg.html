<p>Here is a little (big) project for anyone who's interested. (Maybe Damiano even has some code in this direction already, I think we experimented with this on the toric branch.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Define <code>nonneg A</code>, whenever <code>[has_zero A] [has_le A]</code>. Add a <code>coe</code> to <code>A</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>A</code> is an <code>ordered_add_monoid</code>, so is <code>nonneg A</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>A</code> is an <code>ordered_add_group</code>, then <code>nonneg A</code> is cancellative.</li>
<li>If <code>A</code> is an <code>ordered_semiring</code>, so is <code>nonneg A</code>. In this case <code>nonneg A</code> is also <code>comm_monoid_with_zero</code> (even an ordered one, do we have a class for that?)</li>
<li>If <code>A</code> is an <code>linear_ordered_field</code>, then <code>nonneg A</code> is a <code>linear_ordered_comm_group_with_zero</code></li>
<li>Define an ordered ring equiv between <code>nat</code> and <code>nonneg int</code></li>
<li>Refactor <code>nnreal</code> to use this machinery.</li>
<li>Define <code>nnrat</code> to be <code>nonneg rat</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Actually, this is something that I was planning to do for the <code>ordered</code> refactor.  Once you get to a type with add and mul and \le, multiplication is monotone only by the non-negative elements.  Thus, my plan was to define the type of nonnegative elements of exactly what you said and start proving stuff about this!</p>

<p>... and it did start in order to prove stuff for nnreal, arising from liquid, both from the toric side and from the real inequalities side!</p>

<p>By the way, the first PR in the <code>ordered</code> refactor has already received positive comments from Anne and Floris.  In case anyone is interested in taking a look, this is the current winner:<br>

<p>(and don't feel daunted by the size of the PR: the 442 removed lines are essentially lemmas that changed files.  The PR really only contains fewer than 300 new lines, most of which are doc-strings.)</p>

<p>Now that the PRs splitting the ordered hierarchy have (mostly) taken care of monoids and groups, the next on the list is rings.  In this case, the assumption on monotonicity for addition is already there, but the assumption on monotonicity of multiplication is going to require a non-negativity/positivity assumption on the multiplier.</p>
<p>For flexibility, given the experiment in the liquid project, I would set this up as a function from a Type to a [Type with <code>le</code> and <code>zero</code>] such that the function is injective and the elements in the image are... non-negative?  Positive?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pro of non-negative/Con of positive<br>
mostly, the source could be assumed to be, for instance, a semiring, which could come in handy, e.g. when saying that we multiply a real number by a nnreal number (or a <code>nat</code>!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Con of non-negative/Pro of positive<br>
for roughly half the statements, there would have to be a non-zero assumption on the (image of the) multiplier, instead of a single check when setting up the action.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Which of these two do you think outweighs the other?  Is there something else that you think could be a deciding factor?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>PS  The second refactor is <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/7645">#7645</a>, freshly opened!</p>

<p>The first option is the more flexible/general one, right?</p>

<p>I think so: the first option includes all second options, plus the ones which happen to have zero in the image.  I am just worried of a lot of <code>ne_zero</code> showing up in proofs and names of lemmas.</p>
