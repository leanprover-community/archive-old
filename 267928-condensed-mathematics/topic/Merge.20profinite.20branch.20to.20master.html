<p>Topologies on a finite set are just partial orders on a finite set, that's right</p>

<p>It's not a predicate! It contains data, because it was written by a constructivist. But it is a subsingleton, so if <code>p : fintype X</code> and <code>q : fintype X</code> then <code>p = q</code>.</p>

<p>I once asked Conrad if he'd read the proof and I was stunned to hear that he hadn't! My perception is that it's used in Huber's work, in the following situation: you want to prove some theorem about spectral spaces, and sometimes you say "well, WLOG they're schemes, so we're done by some obscure lemma in EGA 2". And of course the counter argument is "it's only point set topology, how hard can it be?"</p>

<p>I don't think that's right. Well, I haven't checked the proof that all spectral spaces arise as the spectrum of a ring, but I've never seen a use of it. To me, this is mostly a coincidence that has an important historical role as it led Hochster to isolate the right class of topological spaces.</p>

<p>Writing this to you feels incredibly stupid, but I recommend you have a look at Wedhorn's lecture notes on adic spaces. In Section 3.3, every proof starting from Remark 3.21 is as Kevin described.</p>

<p>Thanks for the pointer! When I learned this stuff, Wedhorn's notes didn't exist, so I wasn't aware... I assumed these statement were always proved by direct point-set arguments. (I saw the assertions stated without proof in Huber's book, and they all seemed to be easily provable by a direct attack.)</p>

<p>Actually, recently Akhil Mathew explained an argument about spectral spaces to me by writing it as Spec of a ring, but again I think this was only for linguistic reasons.</p>

<p>it's analogous to all those people in the 40s proving lemmas in homological algebra by chasing elements :-)</p>
