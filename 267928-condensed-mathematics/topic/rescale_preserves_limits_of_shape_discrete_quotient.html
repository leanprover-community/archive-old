<p>How about this for an approach: <code>rescale c</code> is an equivalence of categories, and equivalences preserve all limits -- but I can't find the latter. Do we have it? I'm working on the equivalence. Not sure if it's the quickest way but it seems nice to formalise.</p>

<p>This is so messed up. <code>is_equivalence</code> isn't a Prop! Why can't we use is for props and has for data?</p>

<p>It's because the essential inverse of an equivalence is only unique up to isomorphism.</p>

<p>That's true. I guess we could mimic what we have for limits, where <code>has_limit</code> is a prop, which is then used to get the noncomputable <code>limit  F</code>, while we also have <code>is_limit</code> saying that a certain cone is a limit cone, and a bunch of API giving us the canonical isomorphisms.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm fusing about nothing! I just have this dream that in the algebra hierarchy and beyond you can guess how to make eg Dedekind domains by assuming a base typeclass like <code> comm_ring</code> and then putting Prop-valued typeclasses all called is_something on top</p>

<p>OK I pushed a proof of <code>rescale_preserves_limits_of_shape_discrete_quotient</code>. Basically I had to learn how to steer this stuff; once I got the hang of it all proofs were short. The idea is that when mapping between different <code>rescales</code> every map is <code>id</code> but if you write it as <code>λ m, (rescale.of (rescale.of (rescale.of.symm m))),</code> or whatever (this is how to get from <code>rescale (a * b) M</code> to <code>rescale b (rescale a M)</code>) then you don't get any <code>eq.rec</code>s in definitions and things come out really nicely.</p>
<p>So out of interest, the abstract situation here is that we have an <code>nnreal</code>-indexed family of endofunctors <code>F r : C -&gt; C</code> from a category to itself, and the things I needed to explicitly define were: morphisms in both directions between <code>F 1 M</code> and <code>M</code>, morphisms in both directions between <code>F r (F s M)</code> and <code>F (s * r) M</code>, and finally if <code>r = s</code> a morphism from <code>F r M</code> to <code>F s M</code>. All of these maps are the identity on the underlying type (rescaling is moving around some of the other structure on the type), but it took me a while to understand how to prove that they played well with e.g. the topologies. Once I had these maps I could just compose them together to prove that <code>F r</code> and <code>F r^{-1}</code> were equivalences. There is probably some general story going on here -- monoids acting on categories? Not that it matters, it's all working now.</p>

<p>This stuff can be considered as a monoidal functor from the positive reals (considered as a monoidal category) to the monoidal category of endofunctors. This is actually very similar to how <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/find/category_theory.has_shift">docs#category_theory.has_shift</a> is defined.</p>

<p>In fact, we could probably package these rescale functors into a <code>has_shift</code> instance with <code>nnreal</code> (although has_shift wants an additive monoids whereas here we would use the multiplicative monoid)</p>

<p>I dare you to write <code>@[to_additive]</code> in front of <code>has_shift</code> and see what happens. :-)</p>
