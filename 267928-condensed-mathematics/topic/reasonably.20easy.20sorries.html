<p>In <code>thm95/constants.lean</code> I've marked 3 <code>sorry</code>s as doable (around lines 150--160). This involves proving some inequalities between some real numbers.</p>
<p>In <code>breen_deligne/eg.lean</code> there are 4 <code>sorry</code>s. This involves constructing 2 sequences of nonnegative reals, and proving that they satisfy certain inequalities.</p>
<p>I think both sets of sorries are doable by anyone who has a little bit of experience with Lean and real numbers. So if you are looking to make a small contribution to this project, feel free to try your hand at them.</p>

<p>Johan, I am taking look right now at these <code>sorry</code>s!</p>

<p>The "doable" sorrys in <code>thm95/constants.lean</code> have been done. Half of the Breen-Deligne constants has also been done.</p>

<p>For the record: the remaining sorrys are now also done.</p>

<p>In particular, there are now explicit sequences <code>c_</code> and <code>c'</code> for the explicit BD data.</p>
