<p>Does anybody have an idea how to increase the balance in attribution for this project? In all the media attention only a few people are named. It's very sad, but I'm afraid we can't change what the journalists write.</p>
<p>One idea that might help a bit, is if there is a nice landing page that lists the team that worked on LTE. It this is only one click away, then maybe more people will see it. Currently, the only public listing is probably in Peter's second blogpost, and somewhere in a statistics page on github.</p>

<p>actually I'm writing something that cites LTE now, and I would like a list. What did you post on quanta?</p>

<p>But I'm open to changing that list. The good old "write a paper, list the authors alphabetically" is so much easier. But that doesn't really work with all the media stuff.</p>

<p>Nope, he wasn't. As far as I know, this part of the proof is due to Scholze. But I think Clausen read through it at some point before LTE started.</p>

<p>Well, I think that you are addressing two problems at once, here. One is to understand who is in the set of contributing authors, which looks very hard to me; the second is to order it, which will be an easy matter (I guess easily and quickly agreed by all members).</p>
