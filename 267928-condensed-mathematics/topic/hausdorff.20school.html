<p>In Bonn, we host "Hausdorff schools", which are weeklong workshops for phds and postdocs from around the world. See <a href="https://www.hsm.uni-bonn.de/events/hausdorff-schools/">https://www.hsm.uni-bonn.de/events/hausdorff-schools/</a> for some current ones; we previously had one on the Emerton-Gee stack which I think was a big success. We are always looking for good applications for such workshops. Typically, there are ~3 organizers, and there doesn't need to be a Bonn connection. We are currently looking for proposals for 2022/23, a time when hopefully such things will be able to take place normally again. I wondered whether there'd be any interest in organizing such a school related to Lean? (It's not clear to me how feasible this is given how much this involves computers, but just wanted to air the idea. And I'd be happy to have the chance to attend and learn more.) [If anybody is reading this and has other good ideas for schools, we're always looking for good applications! <a href="https://www.hsm.uni-bonn.de/application/program-proposal/">https://www.hsm.uni-bonn.de/application/program-proposal/</a> , proposals should be sent to Patrik Ferrari <a href="https://www.hsm.uni-bonn.de/about-hsm/management/">https://www.hsm.uni-bonn.de/about-hsm/management/</a> ]</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="369530">@Peter Scholze</span> We are organising a workshop at ICERM in 2022, and some of us have submitted a proposal to MSRI for 2023. So we certainly like having in-person meetings.</p>

<p>OK, Great! Well, please consider applying in Bonn, too, now or at any point in the future. (I'm also happy to be a local organizer in case that helps.)</p>

<p>The MSRI proposal is a summer school, so entirely aimed at PhD students. There's no reason Hausdorff couldn't be happening in the same year.</p>

<p>But Hausdorff is also aimed at PhD's and postdocs, right?</p>

<p>Yes, you're right. I was getting confused with Hausdorff trimesters.</p>

<p>Please apply, too! (But Hausdorff trimesters are obviously much more competitive than Hausdorff schools.)</p>

<p>Also, sorry that everything in Bonn is called "Hausdorff". I like to joke that just calling everything Hausdorff doesn't mean that you can actually distinguish any two things...</p>

<p>FWIW, I think we should host as many in person workshops as possible once this pandemic is over. People will certainly be eager to travel again! </p>
<p>(Another option to keep on the radar is BIRS.)</p>

<p>Here in Orsay everything is called Hadamard and we can't even make jokes out of it, we only get the resulting confusion.</p>

<p>Aren't there even Hadamard postdocs in Ecole Polytechnique to make sure everyone is confused?</p>

<p>Yes, because, although École polytechnique is <em>not</em> part of Université Paris-Saclay, both mathematics departments there (pure and and applied) are part of the Fondation mathématiques Jacques Hadamard, together with Orsay, IHES, Versailles and Évry. Isn't it wonderfully confusing?</p>

<p>It's already nicely confusing for French people who have known this system for ages, so I can't even imagine what this is for foreign PhD students trying to apply for post-docs in France.</p>
