<p>I just pushed the two step projective resolutions for <code>AddCommGroup</code> and <code>Module</code> over PIDs. First, I thought to use the resolution for Z and the forgetful functor to <code>AddCommGroup</code>, but this makes working with the terms very clumsy.<br>
So now there are two separate sets of definitions and theorems which are unrelated and basically copied over from each other.  I hope this makes working with them better because there will be good defeqs. And let's hope no one needs to comparison morphism too soon :)</p>
<p>And feel free to suggest other names, <code>two_step_resolution</code> and <code>two_step_resolution_ab</code> were just the first ones that came to my mind.</p>

<p>For LTE itself, we only need the <code>AddCommGroup</code> version.</p>
