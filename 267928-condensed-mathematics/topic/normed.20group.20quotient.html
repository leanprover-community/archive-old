<p>While trying to work on Johan's optimistic lemma this afternoon, I noticed the normed group quotient file was not super clean. I pushed a modification in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid/tree/normed_group_quotient">this branch</a>, especially <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid/commit/1c6119e8b1e8efef170c0e6e7f55ed61eee9026d">this commit</a>, but maybe the gain is not so clear. What do you think?</p>

<p>github is a bit confused by the diff, looking at the new file is probably clearer.</p>

<p>Definitely cleaner than the previous version!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> LGTM! Thanks <span aria-label="octopus" class="emoji emoji-1f419" role="img" title="octopus">:octopus:</span> And thanks to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="130384">@Riccardo Brasca</span> for writing the first version! Feel free to merge it into master when you think you are done.<br>
The gain is pretty clear: we can now PR this to mathlib.<br>
(Just one comment, I think some of the results about <code>is_quotient</code> should be in the <code>is_quotient</code> namespace, but were not.)</p>

<p>Note that <code>is_closed</code> is now a class, so you can also remove the <code>[fact (is_closed S)]</code>.</p>

<p>Before PR we can prove that the operator norm of the projection is 1 (this is maybe false if the subspace is the whole thing). I can do it on Monday</p>

<p>I've added <code>norm_quotient_mk</code>, the fact that the operator norm of the projection to the quotient is <code>1</code>, here<br>
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid/commit/6341bd538feed5bcbd85d36d53f97d6d09b91fd1">https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid/commit/6341bd538feed5bcbd85d36d53f97d6d09b91fd1</a></p>
<p>This doesn't seem to be necessary for the LTE, but it's very natural to have if we want to include <code>normed_group_quotient</code> in mathlib. The proof has been surprisingly annoying... if someone wants to golf it he is very welcome <span aria-label="grinning face with smiling eyes" class="emoji emoji-1f601" role="img" title="grinning face with smiling eyes">:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:</span></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/issues/6977">#6977</a> Is on the queue!  After the next mathlib bump I can start working on <code>semi_normed_group</code> in the LTE.</p>
