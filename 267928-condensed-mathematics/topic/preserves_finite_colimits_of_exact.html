<p>As Kevin suggested, I may give some help in the LTE. I just browsed into the repository to find some <code>sorry</code> that I could remove. I am able to finish the proof of <code>preserves_finite_colimits_of_exact</code> in <code>for_mathlib/exact_functor.lean</code>. What remained was that an exact functor between abelian categories preserves coequalizers, and as the work had already been done for cokernels, the proof was purely nonsensical (expressing a coequalizer as the cokernel of a difference of the two maps). I do not know what is the procedure to contribute to the LTE repository: how should I proceed?</p>

<p>Fantastic! Thanks a lot for helping. Here's an invite: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid/invitations">https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid/invitations</a><br>
Feel free to push to master directly. We follow a very loose policy, compared to mathlib.<br>
The only rule is that master should compile without errors. This rule is broken approximately once a month. But it's usually fixed in a couple of hours, and then that's fine.</p>

<p>Thanks! I have pushed this. I shall try to continue fixing some other sorries.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="459699">@Joël Riou</span> ! That same file has several (smaller) sorries around homology that should be relatively easy.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="243562">@Adam Topaz</span>  Indeed, I already removed two other small sorries for <code>homology_iso</code>. For <code>homology_functor_iso</code>, I would be tempted to change the definition and make this a quite straightforward application of <code>homology_iso</code> as something starting like :</p>

<p>It seems the only place where the definition of <code>homology_functor_iso</code> is used is in the unfinished proof of <code>homology_functor_preserves_filtered_colimit</code> in <code>ab5.lean</code>, so that changing the def would not seriously break anything. The <code>sorry</code> in that unfinished proof seems uneasy (it is an intricate equality of morphisms). A more basic approach for this would be to prove that the <code>nat_trans.kernel_functor</code> (resp. <code>cokernel_functor</code>) of a natural transformation between filtering colimit preserving functors also preserve filtering colimits. Then, expressing the homology as a combination of kernel and cokernel, the lemma would basically reduce to the fact that the evaluation functors <code>homological_complex A c ⥤ A</code> preserve filtered colimits, which you did already. It might be quite long, but each step would be small. However, it seems there are suboptimal universe assumptions in the definition of <code>nat_trans.kernel_functor</code> in mathlib. Then, the right thing would be to fix this in mathlib, which may imply syncing with the current version of mathlib. <span aria-label="skull and crossbones" class="emoji emoji-2620" role="img" title="skull and crossbones">:skull_and_crossbones:</span></p>

<p>From past experience, it seems that homology is easier to work with if maps to/from are defined using <code>homology.lift</code>and <code>homology.desc'</code> (note the <code>'</code>), so I would prefer to keep the defs as they are. With you suggestion, the map would be a composition of two such morphisms, so it would still be reasonable to work with.</p>

<p>Oh actually using <code>homology.map_iso</code> would probably introduce some stuff that's not very pleasant...</p>
