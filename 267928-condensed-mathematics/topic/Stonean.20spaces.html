<p>In general, extremally disconnected spaces are something more general. But in this project we use it as a synonym for Stonean spaces.</p>

<p>Compact Hausdorff extremally disconnected topological space sounds fine to me, but I don't know whether we should use Stonean locales instead.</p>

<p>We'll need some API for them. In particular the equivalence with the current definition (i.e., projective objects in <code>Profinite</code> or <code>CompHaus</code>, i.e., lifting against surjections)</p>

<p>I wonder if some of my work on Polish spaces is related to what you do in LTE. Among other things, there are two basic topological results I prove there:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any nonempty  closed subset <code>s</code> of <code>ℕ → ℕ</code> is a retract, i.e., there is a continuous map from <code>ℕ → ℕ</code> to <code>s</code> coinciding with the identity on <code>s</code>.</li>
<li>Any nonempty Polish space (i.e., complete second-countable metric space) is a continuous image of <code>ℕ → ℕ</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>(and I also define analytic sets, as continuous images of Polish spaces).</p>
<p>If you have already pushed some related stuff, I should probably refactor my proofs to use what you have done.</p>

<p>I don't think extremally disconnected spaces will ever be Polish, or vice versa. (Except maybe finite spaces.)</p>

<p>Your spaces are compact but non-metrizable in general, right? (So, small from the topological point of view, but big from the cardinality point of view). While Polish spaces are complete but metrizable (so, bigger from the topological point of view, but smaller from the cardinality point of view).</p>

<p>I have been thinking that there should be a descriptive set theory-flavored analogue to the condensed story, which ought to be adequate for applications to analysis, but I don't think there is a direct connection to the current setup.</p>
