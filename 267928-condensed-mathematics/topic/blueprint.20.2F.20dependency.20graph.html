<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110031">@Patrick Massot</span> wrote some fantastic tooling for the Sphere eversion project, and has improved it over the last couple of days.<br>
I've used it to write some sort of blueprint. But the parts that lie before us are not yet fleshed out in a lot of detail. Work in progress. As a wonderful side effect, we get a really nice graph of what is done, and where we want to go (at least as first target).</p>
<p>I hope that this will move to a more stable URL in a couple of days, but I'm sharing this now because it might already be useful for some things.</p>

<p>Hmm. Seems like a pygraphviz issue. Could this be a function of pip turning off py2 support? Weird, because we're using py3.</p>

<p>By the way --- the blueprint and/or dependency graph don't seem to have many links to them! I couldn't find any, and had to construct the URL myself from knowing how github-pages works.

<p>Back to working. My current attempts at making it less brittle have led to empty pages. So I'm going to leave as is for now. The rate limiting step is still building the <code>lean-liquid</code> library.</p>

<p>This is actually a bug in the current blueprint plugin for plasTeX. Around Christmas I updated the default plasTeX theme and when I set up the liquid blueprint I adapted the blueprint plugin only minimally.  If you look at the sphere eversion blueprint you'll see proof are folded by default and the + sign next to the proof word actually works.</p>

<p>Maybe it's time to split the blueprint into several HTML pages anyway. In that case we can easily add a link to the graph page from the menu, as in <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/sphere-eversion/blueprint/index.html">https://leanprover-community.github.io/sphere-eversion/blueprint/index.html</a></p>

<p>I managed to waste almost two hours on this because I forgot I set myself a trap in the leanblueprint plasTeX plugin. The liquid blueprint modification is <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/liquid/commit/a905f671aa440b92ec44bb58e95ff0068579e78f">two characters long</a> (actually one would be enough) but it didn't work before I <a href="https://github.com/PatrickMassot/leanblueprint/commit/a839d37af7b2305ab864b05013186efb626492e1">fixed the plugin</a>. I forgot that the page layout is overidden in the blueprint plugin (precisely to add this dependency graph link!). And I forgot to propagate a plasTeX change there, so things were inconsistent...</p>

The node <code>Lbar-ses</code> is also almost done. Two relatively straightforward <code>sorry</code>s remain.</p>
<p><code>acyclic-sheaf</code> and <code>free-png</code> are two nodes that will require something beyond homological algebra. The rest seems to be only homological algebra.</p>

<p>I have spent the day trying to make <code>discrete</code> either a structure or irreducible. This might not look like LTE, but secretly is: afterward I'm hoping both shift functors and pretriangulated categories will work better, and we'll have a clearer path to setting up derived categories.</p>

<p>Did you hit trouble? Or is it mostly working?</p>

<p>Unfortunately the coherence theorems for monoidal categories and bicategories seem to rely on this heavily, and I quickly got lost.</p>

<p>I will ask Yuma and/or Markus soon to help out. Otherwise, it is starting to work. Still a ways to go. I may ask <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="243562">@Adam Topaz</span> if he can help fix the multiequalizers file, as I'm confused by the errors there and he wrote it recently. (This is on <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/discrete_structure">branch#discrete_structure</a>.)</p>

<p>I've finally reached the <code>shift.lean</code> file --- where apparently every single line has a red squiggle. :-) Hopefully this is a good sign, however, that after fixing it will work better.</p>
