<p>I'm reading about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priestley_space">Priestley spaces</a> from Priestley's book and thought it would be moderately easy to formalize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkhoff%27s_representation_theorem">Birkhoff's representation theorem</a> and fun to try Priestley's generalization to her spaces. But then I read there was a isomorphism of category between Priestley spaces and pairwise Stone spaces, and spectral spaces?!? So I went down a wikipedia rabbit hole and I found myself reading about profinite sets and condensed mathematics.<br>
So two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you people taken over all of mathematics? <span aria-label="scream" class="emoji emoji-1f631" role="img" title="scream">:scream:</span> </li>
<li>How much can I reuse from LTE for my above purpose?</li>

<p>Not all schemes are spectral, since not all are (quasi-)compact. Interestingly, every open subspace of a spectral space <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/a/2805/3332">is the underlying space of a scheme</a>. Sobriety of schemes was PR'd into mathlib last month by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="439483">@Andrew Yang</span> and I don't find any follow-up PRs, and it seems the definition of spectral spaces and equivalent characterizations aren't yet in mathlib; we should show that prime spectra are spectral once it's defined. And IMO the proof that schemes are quasi-sober and T0 should be split into proofs that prime spectra are quasi-sober and T0, and that quasi-sobriety and T0-ness are local properties. We currently lack a definition of "local predicates" on topological spaces, though we have theorems like <code>quasi_sober_of_open_cover</code>; locally (path) connectedness (are they defined in mathlib?) and semi-locally-simply-connectedness (setup for covering space theory) are also examples but spectrality is not.</p>

<p>There is a nice example in Liu's book of a scheme with no closed point (hence is not spectral). (Of course it is not quasi compact.)</p>

<p>The sobriety and T0-ness of the prime spectrum are indeed proved separately and used in the proofs of schemes.</p>
<p>I’m not planning to add results about spectral spaces though. If someone wants to add them, feel free to go for them.</p>
<p>We should have most the ingredients to show that prime spectrums are spectral. The only thing missing is probably open quasicompact iff ideal f.g. (or do we have it already?)</p>

<p>I love spectral spaces! Writing etale cohomology of diamonds was to a large extent an exercise in the point-set topology of spectral spaces ;-). (Also the referee noted that they were struggling the hardest with the proofs in point-set topology...)</p>
<p>If you really want to go down a rabbit hole, read up about Lurie's take on Makkai's conceptual completeness theorem <a href="https://www.math.ias.edu/~lurie/278x.html">https://www.math.ias.edu/~lurie/278x.html</a> . Makkai's conceptual completeness theorem is a strengthening of Gödel's completeness theorem, and says that in some appropriate sense, a first order theory [the "syntax"] is determined by its models (with enough extra structure) [the "semantics"]. I gather it's in this way also some very souped up version of Birkhoff's representability theorem. In his course, Lurie uses ideas surrounding the pro-etale site etc, and then shows that there's a fully faithful functor from "first order logic" (appropriately made into a category) [the "syntax" side] to condensed categories [the "semantics" side]. (In one direction: To any first order theory <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">T</span></span></span></span>, you can look at all the models of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">T</span></span></span></span>, and these are most naturally organized into a condensed category (Lurie uses a slightly different language of ultracategories, but that's just cosmetical).

<p>I'm defining the categories on the order side of the story in <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/11677">#11677</a>. Hopefully, I can give a stab at the ones on the topological side once they have sunk more in my category newbie brain.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="461284">@Sara Rousta</span> and I just wrote a first draft of pairwise Stone spaces over at <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/tree/bitopology">branch#bitopology</a>. Modulo some sorried instances, we have the forgetful functor <code>Profinite ⥤ BiStone</code>. However, I don't really understand the (bi)zero dimensionality condition.<br>
<code>Profinite</code> is compact + Hausdorff + totally disconnected while <code>BiStone</code> is bicompact + bi-Hausdorff + bi-zero dimensional. Why is the last condition different? Or are they actually the same, somehow?</p>

Tl;dr: they are not equivalent, but if you add compact Hausdorff it should be fine.</p>
