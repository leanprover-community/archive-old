<p>We've been closing a couple of todos/issues: <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid/projects/1">https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-liquid/projects/1</a><br>
Most notably the <code>semi_normed</code> refactor by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="130384">@Riccardo Brasca</span>, but also Lemma 9.7, recently by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="300245">@Filippo A. E. Nuccio</span>.<br>
It feels really good that the right hand list contains more items than the two columns left of it.</p>

<p>It was a pleasure, and  let me stress that as usual nothing  would have been possible without Johan's coordination of the project.</p>
<p>In any case I have even learnt some math!  Do you know that the quotient of a <code>semi_normed_group</code> by a closed subspace is always a <code>normed_group</code>? The proof is easy (I mean, it is <em>literally</em> the same as for quotients of normed groups), but I find the result quite counter-intuitive.</p>

<p>Congratulations on the progress you are making! It's great to see that the rest of the way towards 9.4 is cut down into nice "little" pieces. (Aside: The GitHub color-coding seems really counterintuitive. Green is for to-do's, Red is for things completed?)</p>

<p>The homotopy argument is now completely done. So what is left:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gordan's lemma. Kevin and Eric have been making good progress towards this.</li>
<li>Polyhedral lattice quotients:<ul>
<li>show that polyhedral lattices have the discrete topology, so that quotients are normed groups (this probably also needs Gordan)</li>
<li>show that the quotients have a polyhedral norm</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>col_exact</code> part of the proof of thm 9.5. Adam has done an enormous amount of work to setup all the Cech machinery. It looks like we are getting into good shape for the attack on this part of the proof.</li>

<p>There must have been some miscommunication here.... I wasn't intending on working 9.2 (in the near future). All I was saying is that the argument with clopen covers that Peter sketched in zulip has some parts that were similar to what I was doing with representing profinite sets as limits of finite sets. And if anything, this is only useful for the very first part of 9.2 where you extend locally constant function along a closed embedding.</p>

<p>Can someone tell me how I should read the progress marked on the dependency graph, with respect to the overall goal of the LTE of proving the main theorem? As it currently stands, the graph doesn't generate a category with a terminal object, which is what one might expect. There are also theorems that don't seem to be used anywhere, for instance <code>snakelemma</code>. Of course, if the actual statement that is the main goal is not yet in the project, then this might be expected. </p>
<p>But, more generally, what's a human-level explanation of where things are at? (Given the TeX blueprint needs updating, apparently, and things are getting down and dirty in the depths of the Gordan lemma material). Is the main theorem proved, modulo some minor <code>sorry</code>s and finishing up some technical part of Gordan? Or is there still some assembly to do?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="130272">@David Michael Roberts</span> I plan on updating the blueprint today and tomorrow. The first target is <code>first_target</code> which is one of the bottom nodes in the dependency graph. It is maybe a bit deceptive that it is already colored green, but that is because the proof <code>explicit =&gt; first_target</code> is done already in Lean. So what really needs doing is <code>explicit</code>, which is what corresponds to Thm 9.5 in Analytic.pdf.</p>

<p>Those fiddly constants are indeed my remaining (small) worry. The parts where these constants enter in tricky ways are 9.6 and the homotopy part of the proof of 9.5, and these have been done (and even if the constants haven't been finalized even for those parts, it is easy to see from the code that this poses no problems). So yes, it definitely looks firmer now, but as you say it ain't over till it's over.</p>

<p>By the way, there's a purely mathematical question asked in Analytic.pdf, namely Question 9.9 about the growth of certain constants in the proof. Once the first target 9.4 is complete, we will have a Lean-certified answer to this!</p>
