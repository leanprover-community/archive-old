<p>As Johan knows, I am trying to get on top of what has been done so far so I can take more of a lead in the project now my teaching is essentially over for the year. I'm doing this by writing module docstrings for every file in the <code>module_docstrings</code> branch.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> together with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110049">@Mario Carneiro</span> I've been doing more work on the <code>rescale_iso</code> branch. We'll take care of any merge conflicts.</p>

<p>One thing that we did is moving all the <code>rescale.lean</code> files into a <code>rescale/</code> subdirectory of <code>src/</code>.</p>

<p>I've not yet got to the murky details of the rescalings.</p>

<p>My branch does literally nothing other than adding module docstrings and some other files called stuff like FILES.md which contain a summary (basically written for me -- they will go stale at some point and might need to be removed) of what is happening in each directory.</p>

<p>Massive thanks to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110038">@Kevin Buzzard</span> for writing lots and lots of docstrings all through the project. There are now also <code>FILES.md</code> in most directories, summarising which files are there, and what they do.</p>
