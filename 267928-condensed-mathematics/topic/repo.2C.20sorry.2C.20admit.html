<p>I've made a couple of changes to the repo with the following effect:</p>
<p>If you now compile <code>src/liquid.lean</code> you should get only 2 warnings about <code>sorry</code>: one for <code>thm95</code> and one for <code>first_target</code>.<br>
The second sorry should be easy to fill in, by reducing it to <code>thm95</code>.</p>
<p>To make this possible, I have moved code that was <code>sorry</code>d to new files that are not in the dependency chain of <code>src/liquid.lean</code>. Of course they should end up in the dependency chain at some point, once they are sorry-free, and used in the proof of <code>thm95</code>.</p>
<p>I have also replace every occurence of <code>sorry</code> in commented code by the word <code>admit</code>, which is functionally equivalent (in tactic mode).<br>
This means that we can now run </p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Bash"><pre><span></span><code>rg sorry <span class="p">|</span> wc -l
<span class="m">12</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>to find that we have 12 lines containing uncommented <code>sorry</code>s (of which 2 are in the README).</p>

<p>Since you are in a cleaning up mood, could you get us rid of the undefined references in the blueprint? They are also generating a lot of noise.</p>

<p>I need to prepare a talk on type theory first...</p>

<p>But I think I'll stay in cleaning up mood for a couple of days, now that <code>thm95</code> is in place.</p>

<p>We need to clean up the mess before we sprint onto the battlefield</p>

<p>I fixed those. But with a "hack". I just put things in a sort of appendix, and we should move them to a better place in the next refactor of the blueprint</p>
