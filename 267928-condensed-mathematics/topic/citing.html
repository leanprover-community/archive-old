<p>I want to very briefly reference the liquid tensor experiment in a paper (to make some remark about Gordan's lemma being needed for it).</p>
<p>What's the preferred way to do so at the moment? Link to the github repository? The most recent mathlib blog post? The quanta or nature article?</p>

<p>Since hopefully the project will be cited many times, it might be worth codifying an answer to Eric's question in a CITATION file: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files">https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files</a></p>

<p>My experience with citation files is that it's easier to just create a <code>CITATION.md</code> with a summary rather than use their recommended file format</p>

<p>Since then you can customize the bibtex to what you actually want people to use</p>
