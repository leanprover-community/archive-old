<p>Thanks, I didn't go back and check. I guess the quote I gave is an example of ambiguous writing. What exactly "these" in the last sentence refers to is ambiguous, and false if one takes is to mean all the proofs mentined in the previous sentence.</p>

But if you want a "simple" condensed proof of an old complicated result, then the final part of <code>Condensed.pdf</code> contains a proof of coherent duality for schemes.</p>

<p>Thank's to Nature's article, I've been contacted by an Italian scientific journalist to speak in a pop science radio program about LTE. This will be of very limited interested unless you speak Italian (and even in that case  I don't think I will speak more than a couple of minutes). I have no idea why they contacted me instead of Damiano or Filippo. In any case I find it amazing that journalists are interested in Lean!</p>
