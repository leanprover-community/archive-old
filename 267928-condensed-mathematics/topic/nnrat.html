<p>I'm going to refactor <code>nnrat</code> to use <code>nonneg</code> in the next few days and PR it. Who should I credit? Mostly <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="246273">@Bhavik Mehta</span> I presume?</p>

<p>I think so, yes.</p>

<p>It might also be worth crediting the authors of the <code>nnreal</code> stuff originally, since what I did was adapted from that</p>

<p>Is there precedent for creditin through adaptation? Likely most boilerplate in mathlib is adapted from somewhere else.</p>

<p>In other cases I mention such adaptation credit in implementation details, don't know whether this is standard in mathlib.</p>

<p>Perhaps not, but I would much rather err on the side of over-crediting than under-crediting</p>

<p>Patrick and I wrote quotient groups by copying what Johannes Hoelzl had done for quotient modules, and we mentioned this in the module docstring IIRC</p>

<p>That makes more sense than marking as authors people who never touched the code.</p>
